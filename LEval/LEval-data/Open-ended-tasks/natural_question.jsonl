With this chaos , the totalitarian , theonomic government of `` Gilead '' establishes rule in the former United States in the aftermath of a civil war . Society is organized by power - hungry leaders along with a new , militarized , hierarchical regime of fanaticism and newly created social classes , in which women are brutally subjugated , and by law are not allowed to work , own property , handle money , or read . </P> <P> Worldwide infertility has resulted in the conscription of the few remaining fertile women in Gilead , called `` Handmaids '' , according to an extremist interpretation of the Biblical account of Bilhah . They are assigned to the homes of the ruling elite , where they must submit to ritualized rape by their male masters in order to become pregnant and bear children for those men and their wives . </P> <P> Alongside the Handmaids , much of society is now grouped into classes that dictate their freedoms and duties . Women are divided into a small range of social categories , each one signified by a plain dress in a specific color : Handmaids wear red , Marthas ( who are housekeepers and cooks , named after the biblical figure ) wear green , and Wives ( who are expected to run their households ) wear blue and turquoise . </P> <P> Econowives , the lower - class women who still have minimal agency , are a sort of mixture of all these categories , and they wear gray ( a departure from the book in which Econowives wear clothing striped with the aforementioned colors ) . Women prisoners are called Unwomen and are worked to death clearing toxic waste in the Colonies . </P> <P> Another class of women , Aunts ( who train and oversee the Handmaids ) , wear brown . Additionally , the Eyes are a secret police watching over the general populace for signs of rebellion , Hunters track down people attempting to flee the country , and Jezebels are prostitutes in secret brothels catering to the elite ruling class . </P> <P> June Osborne , renamed Offred ( Elisabeth Moss ) , is the Handmaid assigned to the home of the Gileadan Commander Fred Waterford ( Joseph Fiennes ) and his wife Serena Joy ( Yvonne Strahovski ) . Offred is subject to strict rules and constant scrutiny ; an improper word or deed on her part can lead to brutal punishment . </P> <P> Offred , who is named after her male master ( `` Of Fred '' ) like all Handmaids , was married and had a daughter , a job , a bank account , and her own name and identity in the `` time before '' , but all she can safely do now is follow the rules of Gilead in hopes that she can someday live free again and be reunited with her daughter . The Waterfords , key players in the rise of Gilead , have their own conflicts with the realities of the society they have helped create . </P> <H2> Cast and characters ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of The Handmaid 's Tale characters <H3> Main ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Elisabeth Moss as June Osborne / Offred , a woman who was captured while attempting to escape to Canada with her husband , Luke , and daughter , Hannah .

Serena petitions Fred to allow the sick child to be seen by a Martha who , prior to the Sons of Jacob coup , was one of the nation 's top neonatologists . Fred denies the request , saying that whatever happens to the child must now be left to God 's will . A dismayed Serena forges Fred 's signature to a written order that transfers the Martha to the hospital for a day . Aunt Lydia tells June that she will hold her personally responsible if anything goes wrong with Janine 's visit to the hospital . The neonatologist can find no physical explanation for the child 's deterioration and can recommend no further treatment .

Rowling . The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard , Harry Potter , and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley , all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . The main story arc concerns Harry 's struggle against Lord Voldemort , a dark wizard who intends to become immortal , overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic , and subjugate all wizards and Muggles ( non-magical people ) . </P> <P> Since the release of the first novel , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , on 26 June 1997 , the books have found immense popularity , critical acclaim , and commercial success worldwide . They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers , and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature . The series has also had its share of criticism , including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed , as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts . As of February 2018 , the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide , making them the best - selling book series in history , and have been translated into eighty languages . The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest - selling books in history , with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty - four hours of its release . </P> <P> The series was originally published in English by two major publishers , Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States . A play , Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , based on a story co-written by Rowling , premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre , and its script was published by Little , Brown . The original seven books were adapted into an eight - part film series by Warner Bros. Pictures , which is the third highest - grossing film series of all time as of February 2018 . In 2016 , the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion , making Harry Potter one of the highest - grossing media franchises of all time . </P> <P> A series of many genres , including fantasy , drama , coming of age , and the British school story ( which includes elements of mystery , thriller , adventure , horror , and romance ) , the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references . According to Rowling , the main theme is death . Other major themes in the series include prejudice , corruption , and madness . </P> <P> The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand , with numerous derivative works , a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009 , a studio tour in London that opened in 2012 , a digital platform on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight , and a pentalogy of spin - off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , among many other developments . Most recently , themed attractions , collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter , have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early years </Li> <Li> 1.2 Voldemort returns </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Supplementary works <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child </Li> <Li> 2.2 In - universe books </Li> <Li> 2.3 Pottermore website </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Structure and genre </Li> <Li> 4 Themes </Li> <Li> 5 Origins </Li> <Li> 6 Publishing history <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Translations </Li> <Li> 6.2 Completion of the series </Li> <Li> 6.3 Cover art </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Achievements <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Cultural impact </Li> <Li> 7.2 Commercial success </Li> <Li> 7.3 Awards , honours , and recognition </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Reception <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Literary criticism </Li> <Li> 8.2 Social impact </Li> <Li> 8.3 Controversies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 Adaptations <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Films <Ul> <Li> 9.1. 1 Spin - off prequels </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.2 Games </Li> <Li> 9.3 Audiobooks </Li> <Li> 9.4 Stage production </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Attractions <Ul> <Li> 10.1 The Wizarding World of Harry Potter </Li> <Li> 10.2 The Making of Harry Potter </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 Further reading </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Plot </H2> Further information : Fictional universe of Harry Potter <P> The central character in the series is Harry Potter , a boy who lives in Surrey with his aunt , uncle , and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers , at the age of eleven , that he is a wizard , though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles . The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world , albeit hidden and in secrecy . His magical ability is inborn , and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world . Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , a wizarding academy in Scotland , and it is here where most of the events in the series take place . As Harry develops through his adolescence , he learns to overcome the problems that face him : magical , social , and emotional , including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships , infatuation , romantic relationships , schoolwork and exams , anxiety , depression , stress , and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain 's increasingly - violent second wizarding war . </P> <P> Each novel chronicles one year in Harry 's life during the period from 1991 to 1998 . The books also contain many flashbacks , which are frequently experienced by Harry viewing the memories of other characters in a device called a Pensieve . </P> <P> The environment Rowling created is intimately connected to reality . The British magical community of the Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture , European folklore , classical mythology and alchemy , incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands , magic plants , potions , spells , flying broomsticks , centaurs and other magical creatures , the Deathly Hallows , and the Philosopher 's Stone , beside others invented by Rowling . While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternate universe and the Lord of the Rings ' Middle - earth a mythic past , the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists in parallel within the real world and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life , with the action mostly set in Scotland ( Hogwarts ) , the West Country , Devon , London , and Surrey in southeast England . The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets , ancient pubs , lonely country manors , and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population . </P> <H3> Early years </H3> <P> When the first novel of the series , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone ) opens , it is apparent that some significant event has taken place in the wizarding world -- an event so very remarkable , even Muggles ( non-magical people ) notice signs of it . The full background to this event and Harry Potter 's past is revealed gradually throughout the series . After the introductory chapter , the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter 's eleventh birthday , and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed . </P> <P> Despite Harry 's aunt and uncle 's desperate prevention of Harry learning about his abilities , their efforts are in vain . Harry meets a half - giant , Rubeus Hagrid , who is also his first contact with the wizarding world . Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts as well as some of Harry 's history . Harry learns that , as a baby , he witnessed his parents ' murder by the power - obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort , who subsequently attempted to kill him as well . Instead , the unexpected happened : Harry survived with only a lightning - shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack , and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards , gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse . As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort 's reign of terror , Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world . However , at the orders of the venerable and well - known wizard Albus Dumbledore , the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives , the Dursleys , who have kept him safe but treated him poorly , including confining him to a cupboard without meals and treating as their servant . Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years , from age eleven to seventeen . </P> <P> With Hagrid 's help , Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts . As Harry begins to explore the magical world , the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series . Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends : Ron Weasley , a fun - loving member of an ancient , large , happy , but poor wizarding family , and Hermione Granger , a gifted , bright , and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage . Harry also encounters the school 's potions master , Severus Snape , who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him , the rich brat Draco Malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with , and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher , Quirinus Quirrell , who later turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort . He also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house 's Quidditch team , a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks . The first book concludes with Harry 's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort , who , in his quest to regain a body , yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher 's Stone , a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold . </P> <P> The series continues with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , describing Harry 's second year at Hogwarts . He and his friends investigate a 50 - year - old mystery that appears uncannily related to recent sinister events at the school . Ron 's younger sister , Ginny Weasley , enrolls in her first year at Hogwarts , and finds an old notebook in her belongings which turns out to be an alumnus 's diary , Tom Marvolo Riddle , later revealed to be Voldemort 's younger self , who is bent on ridding the school of `` mudbloods '' , a derogatory term describing wizards and witches of non-magical parentage . The memory of Tom Riddle resides inside of the diary and when Ginny begins to confide in the diary , Voldemort is able to possess her . Through the diary , Ginny acts on Voldemort 's orders and unconsciously opens the `` Chamber of Secrets '' , unleashing an ancient monster , later revealed to be a basilisk , which begins attacking students at Hogwarts . It kills those who make direct eye contact with it and petrifies those who look at it indirectly . The book also introduces a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher , Gilderoy Lockhart , a highly cheerful , self - conceited wizard with a pretentious facade , later turning out to be a fraud . Harry discovers that prejudice exists in the Wizarding World through delving into the school 's history , and learns that Voldemort 's reign of terror was often directed at wizards and witches who were descended from Muggles . Harry also learns about the innate ability of his to speak the snake language Parseltongue is rare and often associated with the Dark Arts . When Hermione is attacked and petrified , Harry and Ron finally piece together the puzzles and unlock the Chamber of Secrets , with Harry destroying the diary for good and saving Ginny , and also destroying a part of Voldemort 's soul . The end of the book reveals Lucius Malfoy , Draco 's father and rival of Ron and Ginny 's father , to be the culprit who slipped the book into Ginny 's belongings and introduced the diary into Hogwarts . </P> <P> The third novel , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , follows Harry in his third year of magical education . It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form . Instead , Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by Sirius Black , his father 's best friend , and , according to the Wizarding World , an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry 's parents . As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors -- dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair -- which are ostensibly protecting the school , he reaches out to Remus Lupin , a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf . Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age . Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend , Peter Pettigrew , who had been hiding as Ron 's pet rat , Scabbers . In this book , a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised -- in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher , none of whom lasts more than one school year . </P> <H3> Voldemort returns </H3> The Elephant House was one of the caf\u00e9s in Edinburgh where Rowling wrote the first part of Harry Potter . <P> During Harry 's fourth year of school ( detailed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ) , Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament , a dangerous yet exciting contest where three `` champions '' , one from each participating school , must compete with each other in three tasks in order to win the Triwizard Cup . This year , Harry must compete against a witch and a wizard `` champion '' from overseas visiting schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , as well as another Hogwarts student , causing Harry 's friends to distance themselves from him . Harry is guided through the tournament by their new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor , Alastor `` Mad - Eye '' Moody , who turns out to be an impostor -- one of Voldemort 's supporters named Barty Crouch , Jr. in disguise . The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series ' shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict . Voldemort 's plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds . Although Harry manages to escape , Cedric Diggory , the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament , is killed by Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort re-enters the Wizarding World with a physical body . </P> <P> In the fifth book , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort . In response to Voldemort 's reappearance , Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix , a secret society which works from Sirius Black 's dark family home to defeat Voldemort 's minions and protect Voldemort 's targets , especially Harry . Despite Harry 's description of Voldemort 's recent activities , the Ministry of Magic and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned . In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore , who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World attempting to warn of Voldemort 's return , the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher . She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic . </P> <P> With Ron and Hermione 's suggestion , Harry forms `` Dumbledore 's Army '' , a secret study group aimed to teach his classmates the higher - level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned from his previous encounters with Dark wizards . Through those lessons , Harry begins to develop a crush on the popular and attractive Cho Chang . Juggling schoolwork , Umbridge 's incessant and persistent efforts to land him in trouble and the defensive lessons , Harry begins to lose sleep as he constantly receives disturbing dreams about a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic , followed by a burning desire . An important prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort is then revealed , and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful connection , allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort 's actions telepathically . In the novel 's climax , Harry is tricked into seeing Sirius tortured and races to the Ministry of Magic . He and his friends face off against Voldemort 's followers ( nicknamed Death Eaters ) at the Ministry of Magic . Although the timely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers ' lives , Sirius Black is killed in the conflict . </P> <P> In the sixth book , Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , Voldemort begins waging open warfare . Harry and his friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts . They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence -- Harry eventually begins dating Ginny , Ron establishes a strong infatuation with fellow Hogwarts student Lavender Brown , and Hermione starts to develop romantic feelings towards Ron . Near the beginning of the novel , lacking his own book , Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with many annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer titled ; `` the Half - Blood Prince . '' This book is a source of scholastic success and great recognition from their new potions master , Horace Slughorn , but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it , becomes a source of concern . With war drawing near , Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore , who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort in a device called a Pensieve . These reveal that in order to preserve his life , Voldemort has split his soul into pieces , creating a series of Horcruxes -- evil enchanted items hidden in various locations , one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book . On their way to collect a Horcrux , Draco , who has joined with the Death Eaters , attempts to attack Dumbledore , and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape , the titular Half - Blood Prince . </P> <P> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , the last original novel in the series , begins directly after the events of the sixth book . Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic . Harry , Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort 's remaining Horcruxes . To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends , they are forced to isolate themselves . A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease , Harry and the Dursleys separate , and Hermione wipes her parents ' memories . As they search for the Horcruxes , the trio learns details about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows , three legendary items that when united under one Keeper , would supposedly grant that person to be the Master of Death . Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one of those items , and Voldemort to be searching for another : the Elder Wand , the most powerful wand in history . At the end of the book , Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore 's past , as well as Snape 's true motives -- he had worked on Dumbledore 's behalf since the murder of Harry 's mother . Eventually , Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia . </P> <P> The book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts . Harry , Ron and Hermione , in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students , defend Hogwarts from Voldemort , his Death Eaters , and various dangerous magical creatures . Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle , including Remus Lupin and Fred Weasley , Ron 's older brother . After learning that he himself is a Horcrux , Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest , who casts a killing curse ( Avada Kedavra ) at him . The defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning of Harry 's presumed death and continue to fight on . Harry awakens and faces Voldemort , whose Horcruxes have all been destroyed . In the final battle , Voldemort 's killing curse rebounds off Harry 's defensive spell ( Expelliarmus ) , killing Voldemort . </P> <P> An epilogue `` Nineteen Years Later '' ( set on 1 September 2017 ) describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects of Voldemort 's death on the Wizarding World . In the epilogue , Harry and Ginny are married with three children , and Ron and Hermione are married with two children . </P> <H2> Supplementary works </H2> <H3> Harry Potter and the Cursed Child </H3> Main article : Harry Potter and the Cursed Child <P> Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a two - part West End stage play . It was written by Jack Thorne , based on a story by J.K. Rowling , Thorne and director John Tiffany . The play opened on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre , London , England . The script was released on 31 July 2016 . The story is set nineteen years after the ending of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and follows Harry Potter , now a Ministry of Magic employee , and his youngest son Albus Severus Potter . The play 's official synopsis was released on 23 October 2015 : </P> <P> It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it is n't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic , a husband , and father of three school - age children . </P> <P> While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs , his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted . As past and present fuse ominously , both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth : sometimes , darkness comes from unexpected places . </P> <H3> In - universe books </H3> See also : J.K. Rowling \u00a7 Philanthropy <P> Rowling has expanded the Harry Potter universe with several short books produced for various charities . In 2001 , she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ( a purported Hogwarts textbook ) and Quidditch Through the Ages ( a book Harry reads for fun ) . Proceeds from the sale of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief . In 2007 , Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard , a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel , one of which was auctioned to raise money for the Children 's High Level Group , a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries . The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008 . Rowling also wrote an 800 - word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones . All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels . </P> <P> In 2016 , she released three new e-books : Hogwarts : An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide , Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power , Politics and Pesky Poltergeists and Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism , Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies . </P> <H3> Pottermore website </H3> <P> In 2011 , Rowling launched a new website announcing an upcoming project called Pottermore . Pottermore opened to the general public on 14 April 2012 . Pottermore allows users to be sorted , be chosen by their wand and play various minigames . The main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey though the story with access to content not revealed by JK Rowling previously , with over 18,000 words of additional content . </P> <P> In September 2015 , the website was completely overhauled and most of the features were removed . The site has been redesigned and it mainly focuses on the information already available , rather than exploration . </P> <H2> Structure and genre </H2> <P> The Harry Potter novels are mainly directed at a young adult audience as opposed to an audience of middle grade readers , children , or adults . The novels fall within the genre of fantasy literature , and qualify as a type of fantasy called `` urban fantasy '' , `` contemporary fantasy '' , or `` low fantasy '' . They are mainly dramas , and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout , though they do contain some notable instances of tragicomedy and black humour . In many respects , they are also examples of the bildungsroman , or coming of age novel , and contain elements of mystery , adventure , horror , thriller , and romance . The books are also , in the words of Stephen King , `` shrewd mystery tales '' , and each book is constructed in the manner of a Sherlock Holmes - style mystery adventure . The stories are told from a third person limited point of view with very few exceptions ( such as the opening chapters of Philosopher 's Stone , Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows and the first two chapters of Half - Blood Prince ) . </P> <P> The series can be considered part of the British children 's boarding school genre , which includes Rudyard Kipling 's Stalky & Co. , Enid Blyton 's Malory Towers , St. Clare 's and the Naughtiest Girl series , and Frank Richards 's Billy Bunter novels : the Harry Potter books are predominantly set in Hogwarts , a fictional British boarding school for wizards , where the curriculum includes the use of magic . In this sense they are `` in a direct line of descent from Thomas Hughes 's Tom Brown 's School Days and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of British public school life '' , though they are , as many note , more contemporary , grittier , darker , and more mature than the typical boarding school novel , addressing serious themes of death , love , loss , prejudice , coming - of - age , and the loss of innocence in a 1990s British setting . </P> <P> The Harry Potter stories feature much medieval imagery and motifs drawn from the King Arthur stories . Hogwarts resembles a medieval university - cum - castle with several professors who belonging to an Order of Merlin ; Old Professor Binns still lectures about the International Warlock Convention of 1289 ; and a real historical person , a 14th century scribe Sir Nicolas Flamel , described as a holder of the Philosopher 's Stone . Other medieval elements in Hogwarts include coats - of - arms and medieval weapons on the walls , letters written on parchment and sealed with wax , the Great Hall of Hogwarts which is similar to the Great Hall of Camelot , the use of Latin phrases , the tents put up for Quidditch tournaments are similar to the `` marvelous tents '' put up for knightly tournaments , imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns which exist around Hogwarts , and the banners with heraldic animals for the four Houses of Hogwarts . Many of the motifs of the Potter stories such as the hero 's quest invoking objects that confer invisibility , magical animals and trees , a forest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars are drawn from medieval French Arthurian romances . Other aspects borrowed from French Arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers , werewolves as characters , and white deer . The American scholars Heather Arden and Kathrn Lorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the Potter stories are inspired by a 14th century French Arthurian romance , Claris et Laris , writing of the `` startling '' similarities between the adventures of Potter and the knight Claris . Arden and Lorenz noted that Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1986 with a degree in French literature and spent a year living in France afterwards . </P> <P> Arnden and Lorenz wrote about the similarity between the Arthurian romances , where Camelot is a place of wonder and safety , and from the heroic knights must venture forth facing various perils , usually in an enchanted forest ; and Hogwarts , likewise a wondrous safe place , where Harry Potter and friends must periodically venture forth from to the magical forest that surrounds Hogwarts . In the same way that knights in the Arthurian romances usually have a female helper , who is very intelligent and has a connection with nature , Harry has Hermione who plays a similar role . Like an Arthurian knight , Harry receives advice and encouragement from his mentor , Albus Dumbldore , who resembles both Merlin and King Arthur , but must vanquish his foes alone . Arnden and Lorenz wrote that with Rowling 's books , the characters are `` ... not a simple reworking of the well - known heroes of romance , but a protean melding of different characters to form new ones ... '' . However , Lorenz and Arnden argue the main inspiration for Harry Potter was Sir Percival , one of the Knights of the Round Table who searches for the Holy Grail . Both Potter and Sir Percival had an `` orphaned or semi-orphaned youth , with inherent nobility and powers '' , being raised by relatives who tried to keep them away from the places where they really belong , Hogwarts and Camelot respectively . Both Percival and Potter are however outsiders in the places that they belong , unfamiliar with the rules of knighthood and magic , but both show extraordinary natural abilities with Percival proving himself an exceptional fighter while Potter is an excellent player of Quidditch . And finally , both Percival and Potter found love and acceptance from surrogate families , in the form of the Knights of the Round Table and the Weasley family respectively . </P> <P> Each of the seven books is set over the course of one school year . Harry struggles with the problems he encounters , and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules . If students are caught breaking rules , they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors . The stories reach their climax in the summer term , near or just after final exams , when events escalate far beyond in - school squabbles and struggles , and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers , the Death Eaters , with the stakes a matter of life and death -- a point underlined , as the series progresses , by characters being killed in each of the final four books . In the aftermath , he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore . The only exception to this school - centred setting is the final novel , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts , and only return there to face Voldemort at the d\u00e9nouement . </P> <H2> Themes </H2> <P> According to Rowling , a major theme in the series is death : `` My books are largely about death . They open with the death of Harry 's parents . There is Voldemort 's obsession with conquering death and his quest for immortality at any price , the goal of anyone with magic . I so understand why Voldemort wants to conquer death . We 're all frightened of it . '' </P> <P> Rowling stated that `` Harry Potter books have always , in fact , dealt explicitly with religious themes and questions '' and that she did not reveal its Christian parallels in the beginning because doing so would have `` give ( n ) too much away to fans who might then see the parallels . '' In the final book of the series Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Rowling makes the book 's Christian imagery more explict , quoting both Matthew 6 : 19 and 1 Corinthians 15 : 26 when Harry visits his parents ' graves . Hermione Granger teaches Harry Potter that the meaning of these verses from the Christian Bible are `` living beyond death . Living after death '' , which Rowling states is `` one of the central foundations of resurrection theology '' and that these bible verses `` epitomize the whole series '' . </P> <P> Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books , some more complex than others , and some including political subtexts . Themes such as normality , oppression , survival , and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series . Similarly , the theme of making one 's way through adolescence and `` going over one 's most harrowing ordeals -- and thus coming to terms with them '' has also been considered . Rowling has stated that the books comprise `` a prolonged argument for tolerance , a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry '' and that they also pass on a message to `` question authority and ... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth '' . </P> <P> While the books could be said to comprise many other themes , such as power / abuse of power , violence and hatred , love , loss , prejudice , and free choice , they are , as Rowling states , `` deeply entrenched in the whole plot '' ; the writer prefers to let themes `` grow organically '' , rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers . Along the same lines is the ever - present theme of adolescence , in whose depiction Rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters ' sexualities and not leaving Harry , as she put it , `` stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence '' . Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction of the ways in which death and violence affects youth , and humanity as a whole . </P> <P> Rowling said that , to her , the moral significance of the tales seems `` blindingly obvious '' . The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy , `` because that ... is how tyranny is started , with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble . '' </P> <H2> Origins </H2> Main article : Harry Potter influences and analogues <P> In 1990 , Rowling was on a crowded train from Manchester to London when the idea for Harry suddenly `` fell into her head '' . Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying : </P> <P> `` I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before . I simply sat and thought , for four ( delayed train ) hours , and all the details bubbled up in my brain , and this scrawny , black - haired , bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me . '' </P> <P> Rowling completed Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone in 1995 and the manuscript was sent off to several prospective agents . The second agent she tried , Christopher Little , offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to Bloomsbury . </P> <H2> Publishing history </H2> The novelist , J.K. Rowling The logo used in British , Australian , and Canadian editions before 2010 , which uses the typeface Cochin Bold . <P> After eight other publishers had rejected Philosopher 's Stone , Bloomsbury offered Rowling a \u00a3 2,500 advance for its publication . Despite Rowling 's statement that she did not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books , the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven . On the eve of publishing , Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender - neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group , fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman . She elected to use J.K. Rowling ( Joanne Kathleen Rowling ) , using her grandmother 's name as her second name because she has no middle name . </P> <P> Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone was published by Bloomsbury , the publisher of all Harry Potter books in the United Kingdom , on 26 June 1997 . It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by Scholastic -- the American publisher of the books -- as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone , after Rowling had received US $105,000 for the American rights -- a record amount for a children 's book by an unknown author . Fearing that American readers would not associate the word `` philosopher '' with magic ( although the Philosopher 's Stone is an ancient tradition in alchemy ) , Scholastic insisted that the book be given the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone for the American market . </P> <P> The second book , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999 . Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999 . Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic . Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series , at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version . It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003 . Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005 ; it sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release . The seventh and final novel , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , was published on 21 July 2007 . The book sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of release , breaking down to 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US . </P> <H3> Translations </H3> Main article : Harry Potter in translation The Russian translation of The Deathly Hallows goes on sale in Moscow , 2007 <P> The series has been translated into 80 languages , placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history . The books have seen translations to diverse languages such as Korean , Armenian , Ukrainian , Arabic , Urdu , Hindi , Bengali , Bulgarian , Welsh , Afrikaans , Albanian , Latvian , Vietnamese and Hawaiian . The first volume has been translated into Latin and even Ancient Greek , making it the longest published work in Ancient Greek since the novels of Heliodorus of Emesa in the 3rd century AD . The second volume has also been translated into Latin . </P> <P> Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well - known authors before their work on Harry Potter , such as Viktor Golyshev , who oversaw the Russian translation of the series ' fifth book . The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay , a popular literary critic and cultural commentator . For reasons of secrecy , translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English , leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available . This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries ; for example , such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English - language book ever to top the best - seller list in France . </P> <P> The United States editions were adapted into American English to make them more understandable to a young American audience . </P> <H3> Completion of the series </H3> <P> In December 2005 , Rowling stated on her web site , `` 2006 will be the year when I write the final book in the Harry Potter series . '' Updates then followed in her online diary chronicling the progress of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , with the release date of 21 July 2007 . The book itself was finished on 11 January 2007 in the Balmoral Hotel , Edinburgh , where she scrawled a message on the back of a bust of Hermes . It read : `` J.K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room ( 552 ) on 11 January 2007 . '' </P> <P> Rowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book ( in fact , the epilogue ) was completed `` in something like 1990 '' . In June 2006 , Rowling , on an appearance on the British talk show Richard & Judy , announced that the chapter had been modified as one character `` got a reprieve '' and two others who previously survived the story had in fact been killed . On 28 March 2007 , the cover art for the Bloomsbury Adult and Child versions and the Scholastic version were released . </P> <P> In September 2012 , Rowling mentioned in an interview that she might go back to make a `` director 's cut '' of two of the existing Harry Potter books . </P> <H3> Cover art </H3> <P> For cover art , Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design , with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express , and a title in the font Cochin Bold . The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic , illustrating scenes from the books . These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft . </P> <P> Due to the appeal of the books among an adult audience , Bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an ' adult ' style . These initially used black - and - white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books ( including a very American Hogwarts Express ) without depicting people , but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin 's locket on the cover of the final book . </P> <P> International and later editions have been created by a range of designers , including Mary GrandPr\u00e9 for U.S. audiences and Mika Launis in Finland . For a later American release , Kazu Kibuishi created covers in a somewhat anime - influenced style . </P> <H2> Achievements </H2> `` Platform 93\u20444 '' sign on London King 's Cross railway station <H3> Cultural impact </H3> Further information : Harry Potter fandom <P> Fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books , beginning with the 2000 publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . The events , commonly featuring mock sorting , games , face painting , and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours . </P> <P> The final book in the series , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows became the fastest selling book in history , moving 11 million units in the first twenty - four hours of release . The series has also gathered adult fans , leading to the release of two editions of each Harry Potter book , identical in text but with one edition 's cover artwork aimed at children and the other aimed at adults . Besides meeting online through blogs , podcasts , and fansites , Harry Potter super-fans can also meet at Harry Potter symposia . </P> <P> The word Muggle has spread beyond its Harry Potter origins , becoming one of few pop culture words to land in the Oxford English Dictionary . The Harry Potter fandom has embraced podcasts as a regular , often weekly , insight to the latest discussion in the fandom . Both MuggleCast and PotterCast have reached the top spot of iTunes podcast rankings and have been polled one of the top 50 favourite podcasts . </P> <P> Some lessons identified in the series include diversity , acceptance , political tolerance , and equality . Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different than those who had not . Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant , more opposed to violence and torture , less authoritarian , and less cynical . Although it is not known if this is a cause - and - effect relationship , there is a clear correlation , and it seems that Harry Potter 's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond . </P> <P> Many fan fiction and fan art works about Harry Potter have been made . In March 2007 , `` Harry Potter '' was the most commonly searched fan fiction subject on the internet . At the University of Michigan in 2009 , StarKid Productions performed an original musical parodying the Harry Potter series called A Very Potter Musical . The musical was awarded Entertainment Weekly 's 10 Best Viral Videos of 2009 . </P> <P> The sport Quidditch , played by characters in the Harry Potter series , was created in 2005 and is played worldwide . Characters and elements from the series have inspired scientific names of several organisms , including the dinosaur Dracorex hogwartsia , the spider Eriovixia gryffindori , the wasp Ampulex dementor , and the crab Harryplax severus . </P> <H3> Commercial success </H3> See also : List of best - selling books Crowd outside a book store for the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince . <P> The popularity of the Harry Potter series has translated into substantial financial success for Rowling , her publishers , and other Harry Potter related license holders . This success has made Rowling the first and thus far only billionaire author . The books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide and have also given rise to the popular film adaptations produced by Warner Bros. , all of which have been highly successful in their own right . The films have in turn spawned eight video games and have led to the licensing of more than 400 additional Harry Potter products . The Harry Potter brand has been estimated to be worth as much as $25 billion . </P> <P> The great demand for Harry Potter books motivated The New York Times to create a separate best - seller list for children 's literature in 2000 , just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . By 24 June 2000 , Rowling 's novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks ; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best - seller list . On 12 April 2007 , Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record , with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site . For the release of Goblet of Fire , 9,000 FedEx trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book . Together , Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book . In the United States , the book 's initial printing run was 3.8 million copies . This record statistic was broken by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , with 8.5 million , which was then shattered by Half - Blood Prince with 10.8 million copies . 6.9 million copies of Prince were sold in the U.S. within the first 24 hours of its release ; in the United Kingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day . The initial U.S. print run for Deathly Hallows was 12 million copies , and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble . </P> <H3> Awards , honours , and recognition </H3> <P> The Harry Potter series has been recognised by a host of awards since the initial publication of Philosopher 's Stone including four Whitaker Platinum Book Awards ( all of which were awarded in 2001 ) , three Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prizes ( 1997 -- 1999 ) , two Scottish Arts Council Book Awards ( 1999 and 2001 ) , the inaugural Whitbread children 's book of the year award ( 1999 ) , the WHSmith book of the year ( 2006 ) , among others . In 2000 , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel , and in 2001 , Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire won said award . Honours include a commendation for the Carnegie Medal ( 1997 ) , a short listing for the Guardian Children 's Award ( 1998 ) , and numerous listings on the notable books , editors ' Choices , and best books lists of the American Library Association , The New York Times , Chicago Public Library , and Publishers Weekly . </P> <P> In 2002 , British sociologist Andrew Blake named Harry Potter among the icons of British popular culture along with the likes of James Bond and Sherlock Holmes . In 2003 , four of the books were named in the top 24 of the BBC 's The Big Read survey of the best loved novels in the UK . A 2004 study found that books in the series were commonly read aloud in elementary schools in San Diego County , California . Based on a 2007 online poll , the U.S. National Education Association listed the series in its `` Teachers ' Top 100 Books for Children '' . Three of the books placed among the `` Top 100 Chapter Books '' of all time , or children 's novels , in a 2012 survey published by School Library Journal : Sorcerer 's Stone ranked number three , Prisoner of Azkaban 12th , and Goblet of Fire 98th . In 2012 , the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London featured a 100 - foot tall rendition of Lord Voldemort in a segment designed to show off the UK 's cultural icons . </P> <H2> Reception </H2> <H3> Literary criticism </H3> <P> Early in its history , Harry Potter received positive reviews . On publication , the first book , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , attracted attention from the Scottish newspapers , such as The Scotsman , which said it had `` all the makings of a classic '' , and The Glasgow Herald , which called it `` Magic stuff '' . Soon the English newspapers joined in , with more than one comparing it to Roald Dahl 's work : The Mail on Sunday rated it as `` the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl '' , a view echoed by The Sunday Times ( `` comparisons to Dahl are , this time , justified '' ) , while The Guardian called it `` a richly textured novel given lift - off by an inventive wit '' . </P> <P> By the time of the release of the fifth book , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars . Yale professor , literary scholar , and critic Harold Bloom raised criticisms of the books ' literary merits , saying , `` Rowling 's mind is so governed by clich\u00e9s and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing . '' A.S. Byatt authored an op - ed article in The New York Times calling Rowling 's universe a `` secondary secondary world , made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children 's literature ... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons , and the exaggerated ( more exciting , not threatening ) mirror - worlds of soaps , reality TV and celebrity gossip '' . </P> <P> Michael Rosen , a novelist and poet , advocated the books were not suited for children , who would be unable to grasp the complex themes . Rosen also stated that `` J.K. Rowling is more of an adult writer . '' The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards . His overall view of the series was negative -- `` the Potter saga was essentially patronising , conservative , highly derivative , dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain '' , and he speaks of `` a pedestrian , ungrammatical prose style '' . Ursula K. Le Guin said , `` I have no great opinion of it . When so many adult critics were carrying on about the ' incredible originality ' of the first Harry Potter book , I read it to find out what the fuss was about , and remained somewhat puzzled ; it seemed a lively kid 's fantasy crossed with a `` school novel '' , good fare for its age group , but stylistically ordinary , imaginatively derivative , and ethically rather mean - spirited . '' </P> <P> By contrast , author Fay Weldon , while admitting that the series is `` not what the poets hoped for '' , nevertheless goes on to say , `` but this is not poetry , it is readable , saleable , everyday , useful prose '' . The literary critic A.N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in The Times , stating : `` There are not many writers who have JK 's Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages , to weep -- openly , with tears splashing -- and a few pages later to laugh , at invariably good jokes ... We have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest , funniest , scariest and most moving children 's stories ever written '' . Charles Taylor of Salon.com , who is primarily a movie critic , took issue with Byatt 's criticisms in particular . While he conceded that she may have `` a valid cultural point -- a teeny one -- about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art '' , he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers . Taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books , shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and social isolation each causes . Taylor also argued that Philosopher 's Stone , said to be the most light - hearted of the seven published books , disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims spur the series ' success : the book opens with news of a double murder , for example . </P> <P> Stephen King called the series `` a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable '' , and declared `` Rowling 's punning , one - eyebrow - cocked sense of humor '' to be `` remarkable '' . However , he wrote that despite the story being `` a good one '' , he is `` a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle '' , the formulaic beginning of all seven books . King has also joked that `` Rowling 's never met an adverb she did not like ! '' He does however predict that Harry Potter `` will indeed stand time 's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept ; I think Harry will take his place with Alice , Huck , Frodo , and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade , but for the ages '' . Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed , saying `` It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year - olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas . What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I 'm not sure -- but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump , comfortable , infantilising society and the popularity of Potter . '' </P> <P> There is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which the series was inspired by Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings books . </P> <H3> Social impact </H3> <P> Although Time magazine named Rowling as a runner - up for its 2007 Person of the Year award , noting the social , moral , and political inspiration she has given her fandom , cultural comments on the series have been mixed . Washington Post book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that the large numbers of adults reading the Potter series but few other books may represent a `` bad case of cultural infantilism '' , and that the straightforward `` good vs. evil '' theme of the series is `` childish '' . He also argued `` through no fault of Rowling 's '' , the cultural and marketing `` hysteria '' marked by the publication of the later books `` trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum , a mass - media experience that no other novel can possibly provide '' . </P> <P> Librarian Nancy Knapp pointed out the books ' potential to improve literacy by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would . The seven - book series has a word count of 1,083,594 ( US edition ) . Agreeing about the motivating effects , Diane Penrod also praised the books ' blending of simple entertainment with `` the qualities of highbrow literary fiction '' , but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific merchandising that accompanies the book launches . However , the assumption that Harry Potter books have increased literacy among young people is `` largely a folk legend . '' Research by the National Endowment for the Arts ( NEA ) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the Harry Potter publishing phenomenon , nor has the broader downward trend in reading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the Harry Potter books . The research also found that children who read Harry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres . NEA chairman Dana Gioia said the series , `` got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books . The trouble is that one Harry Potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading . '' </P> <P> Jennifer Conn used Snape 's and Quidditch coach Madam Hooch 's teaching methods as examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching , and Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first - year sociology class : `` sociological concepts including culture , society , and socialisation ; stratification and social inequality ; social institutions ; and social theory '' . </P> <P> From the early 2000s onwards several news reports appeared in the UK of the Harry Potter book and movie series driving demand for pet owls and even reports that after the end of the movie series these same pet owls were now being abandoned by their owners . This led J.K. Rowling to issue several statements urging Harry Potter fans to refrain from purchasing pet owls . Despite the media flurry , research into the popularity of Harry Potter and sales of owls in the UK failed to find any evidence that the Harry Potter franchise had influenced the buying of owls in the country or the number of owls reaching animal shelters and sanctuaries . </P> <P> Jenny Sawyer wrote in Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a `` disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society '' in that stories `` moral center ( sic ) have all but vanished from much of today 's pop culture ... after 10 years , 4,195 pages , and over 375 million copies , J.K. Rowling 's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children 's literature : the hero 's moral journey '' . Harry Potter , Sawyer argues , neither faces a `` moral struggle '' nor undergoes any ethical growth , and is thus `` no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white '' . In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry 's first passage through to Platform 93\u20444 as an application of faith and hope , and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes . She also noted the `` deeper magic '' by which the self - sacrifice of Harry 's mother protects the boy throughout the series , and which the power - hungry Voldemort fails to understand . </P> <P> In an 8 November 2002 Slate article , Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a `` trust - fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him '' . Noting that in Rowling 's fiction , magical ability potential is `` something you are born to , not something you can achieve '' , Suellentrop wrote that Dumbledore 's maxim that `` It is our choices that show what we truly are , far more than our abilities '' is hypocritical , as `` the school that Dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else '' . In a 12 August 2007 , review of Deathly Hallows in The New York Times , however , Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for `` unmooring '' her `` English school story '' from literary precedents `` bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery '' , arguing that she had instead created `` a world of youthful democracy and diversity '' . </P> <P> In 2010 , coinciding with the release of the film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 , a series of articles were written about Private Harry Potter of the British army . This real - life Harry Potter was killed in the Arab Revolt near Hebron in 1939 . His grave , located in the British cemetery in Ramla , Israel , began to receive curious visitors leading the Ramla Municipality to list it on their website . </P> <P> In 2016 , an article written by Diana C. Mutz compares the politics of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign . She states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant ' 1 ) the value of tolerance and respect for difference ; 2 ) opposition to violence and punitiveness ; and 3 ) the dangers of authoritarianism . ' She suggests that these themes are also present in the presidential election and it may play a significant role in how Americans have responded to the campaign . </P> <H3> Controversies </H3> Main articles : Legal disputes over the Harry Potter series , Religious debates over the Harry Potter series , Politics of Harry Potter , and Tanya Grotter <P> The books have been the subject of a number of legal proceedings , stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements . The popularity and high market value of the series has led Rowling , her publishers , and film distributor Warner Bros. to take legal measures to protect their copyright , which have included banning the sale of Harry Potter imitations , targeting the owners of websites over the `` Harry Potter '' domain name , and suing author Nancy Stouffer to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work . Various religious conservatives have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as Wicca and are therefore unsuitable for children , while a number of critics have criticised the books for promoting various political agendas . </P> <P> The books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds . From 1997 to 1998 , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone won almost all the UK awards judged by children , but none of the children 's book awards judged by adults , and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children . In 1999 , the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children 's division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award , and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner ; it finished second , very close behind the winner of the poetry prize , Seamus Heaney 's translation of the Anglo - Saxon epic Beowulf . </P> <P> In 2000 , shortly before the publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , the previous three Harry Potter books topped The New York Times fiction best - seller list and a third of the entries were children 's books . The newspaper created a new children 's section covering children 's books , including both fiction and non-fiction , and initially counting only hardback sales . The move was supported by publishers and booksellers . In 2004 , The New York Times further split the children 's list , which was still dominated by Harry Potter books into sections for series and individual books , and removed the Harry Potter books from the section for individual books . The split in 2000 attracted condemnation , praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move . Time suggested that , on the same principle , Billboard should have created a separate `` mop - tops '' list in 1964 when the Beatles held the top five places in its list , and Nielsen should have created a separate game - show list when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? dominated the ratings . </P> <H2> Adaptations </H2> <H3> Films </H3> Main article : Harry Potter ( film series ) The locomotive that features as the `` Hogwarts Express '' in the film series . <P> In 1998 , Rowling sold the film rights of the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported \u00a3 1 million ( $1,982,900 ) . Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly British , nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore , and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such . After many directors including Steven Spielberg , Terry Gilliam , Jonathan Demme , and Alan Parker were considered , Chris Columbus was appointed on 28 March 2000 as the director for Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( titled `` Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone '' in the United States ) , with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire and proven experience with directing children as influences for their decision . </P> <P> After extensive casting , filming began in October 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London itself , with production ending in July 2001 . Philosopher 's Stone was released on 14 November 2001 . Just three days after the film 's release , production for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , also directed by Columbus , began . Filming was completed in summer 2002 , with the film being released on 15 November 2002 . Daniel Radcliffe portrayed Harry Potter , doing so for all succeeding films in the franchise . </P> <P> Columbus declined to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , only acting as producer . Mexican director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n took over the job , and after shooting in 2003 , the film was released on 4 June 2004 . Due to the fourth film beginning its production before the third 's release , Mike Newell was chosen as the director for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , released on 18 November 2005 . Newell became the first British director of the series , with television director David Yates following suit after he was chosen to helm Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix . Production began in January 2006 and the film was released the following year in July 2007 . After executives were `` really delighted '' with his work on the film , Yates was selected to direct Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , which was released on 15 July 2009 . </P> A studio model of Hogwarts Castle as it appears in the films . <P> In March 2008 , Warner Bros. President and COO Alan F. Horn announced that the final instalment in the series , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , would be released in two cinematic parts : Part 1 on 19 November 2010 and Part 2 on 15 July 2011 . Production of both parts started in February 2009 , with the final day of principal photography taking place on 12 June 2010 . </P> <P> Rowling had creative control on the film series , observing the filmmaking process of Philosopher 's Stone and serving as producer on the two - part Deathly Hallows , alongside David Heyman and David Barron . The Harry Potter films have been top - rank box office hits , with all eight releases on the list of highest - grossing films worldwide . Philosopher 's Stone was the highest - grossing Harry Potter film up until the release of the final instalment of the series , Deathly Hallows , while Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least . As well as being a financial success , the film series has also been a success among film critics . </P> <P> Opinions of the films are generally divided among fans , with one group preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films , and another group preferring the more stylised character - driven approach of the later films . Rowling has been constantly supportive of all the films and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her `` favourite one '' in the series . She wrote on her website of the changes in the book - to - film transition , `` It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long . Obviously films have restrictions novels do not have , constraints of time and budget ; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers ' imaginations '' . </P> <P> At the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011 , Rowling was joined by producers David Heyman and David Barron along with directors David Yates , Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and Mike Newell in collecting the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema on behalf of all the films in the series . Actors Rupert Grint and Emma Watson , who play main characters Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger , were also in attendance . </P> Spin - off prequels <P> A new series consisting of five films , beginning with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , will take place before the main series . The first film was released on 18 November 2016 and the next two are due to be released in 2018 and 2020 . Rowling wrote the screenplay for the first instalment , marking her first foray into screenwriting . </P> <H3> Games </H3> Main article : Harry Potter video games <P> A number of other non-interactive media games and board games have been released such as Cluedo Harry Potter Edition , Scene It ? Harry Potter and Lego Harry Potter models , which are influenced by the themes of both the novels and films . </P> <P> There are thirteen Harry Potter video games , eight corresponding with the films and books and five spin - offs . The film / book - based games are produced by Electronic Arts , as was Harry Potter : Quidditch World Cup , with the game version of the first entry in the series , Philosopher 's Stone , being released in November 2001 . Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone went on to become one of the best - selling PlayStation games ever . The video games were released to coincide with the films , containing scenery and details from the films as well as the tone and spirit of the books . Objectives usually occur in and around Hogwarts , along with various other magical areas . The story and design of the games follow the selected film 's characterisation and plot ; EA worked closely with Warner Bros. to include scenes from the films . The last game in the series , Deathly Hallows , was split , with Part 1 released in November 2010 and Part 2 debuting on consoles in July 2011 . The two - part game forms the first entry to convey an intense theme of action and violence , with the gameplay revolving around a third - person shooter style format . </P> <P> The spin - off games Lego Harry Potter : Years 1 -- 4 and Lego Harry Potter : Years 5 -- 7 were developed by Traveller 's Tales and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment . The spin - off games Book of Spells and Book of Potions were developed by SCE London Studio and use the Wonderbook , an augmented reality book designed to be used in conjunction with the PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye . The Harry Potter universe is also featured in Lego Dimensions , with the settings and side characters featured in the Harry Potter Adventure World , and Harry , Voldemort , and Hermione as playable characters . In 2017 , Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment opened its own Harry Potter themed game design studio , by the name of Portkey Games ; before releasing Hogwarts Mystery in 2018 , developed by Jam City . </P> <H3> Audiobooks </H3> <P> All seven Harry Potter books have been released in unabridged audiobook versions , with Stephen Fry reading the UK editions and Jim Dale voicing the series for the American editions . </P> <H3> Stage production </H3> Main article : Harry Potter and the Cursed Child <P> Harry Potter and the Cursed Child : Parts I and II is a play which serves as a sequel to the books , beginning nineteen years after the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . It was written by Jack Thorne based on an original new story by Thorne , Rowling and John Tiffany . It has run at the Palace Theatre in London 's West End since previews began on 7 June 2016 with an official premiere on 30 June 2016 . The first four months of tickets for the June -- September performances were sold out within several hours upon release . Forthcoming productions are planned for Broadway and Melbourne . </P> <P> The script was released as a book at the time of the premiere , with a revised version following the next year . </P> <H2> Attractions </H2> <H3> The Wizarding world of Harry Potter </H3> Main article : The Wizarding World of Harry Potter Hogwarts Castle as depicted in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter , located in Universal Orlando Resort 's Island of Adventure <P> After the success of the films and books , Universal and Warner Brothers announced they would create The Wizarding World of Harry Potter , a new Harry Potter - themed expansion to the Islands of Adventure theme park at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida . The land officially opened to the public on 18 June 2010 . It includes a re-creation of Hogsmeade and several rides . The flagship attraction is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey , which exists within a re-creation of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . Other rides include Dragon Challenge , a pair of inverted roller coasters , and Flight of the Hippogriff , a family roller coaster . </P> <P> Four years later , on 8 July 2014 , Universal opened a Harry Potter - themed area at the Universal Studios Florida theme park . It includes a re-creation of Diagon Alley and connecting alleys and a small section of Muggle London . The flagship attraction is Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts roller coaster ride . Universal also added a completely functioning recreation of the Hogwarts Express connecting Kings Cross Station at Universal Studios Florida to the Hogsmeade station at Islands of Adventure .

The copper statue , a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States , was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel . The statue was dedicated on October 28 , 1886 . </P> <P> The Statue of Liberty is a figure of a robed woman representing Libertas , a Roman goddess . She holds a torch above her head with her right hand , and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with `` JULY IV MDCCLXXVI '' ( July 4 , 1776 ) , the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence . A broken chain lies at her feet . The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States , and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad . </P> <P> Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician , \u00c9douard Ren\u00e9 de Laboulaye , who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples . Because of the post-war instability in France , work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s . In 1875 , Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal . Bartholdi completed the head and the torch - bearing arm before the statue was fully designed , and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions . </P> <P> The torch - bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 , and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882 . Fundraising proved difficult , especially for the Americans , and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds . Publisher Joseph Pulitzer , of the New York World , started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar . The statue was built in France , shipped overseas in crates , and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe 's Island . The statue 's completion was marked by New York 's first ticker - tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland . </P> <P> The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War ; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service . Public access to the balcony around the torch has been barred for safety since 1916 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Design and construction process <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Origin </Li> <Li> 1.2 Design , style , and symbolism </Li> <Li> 1.3 Announcement and early work </Li> <Li> 1.4 Construction in France <Ul> <Li> 1.4. 1 Design </Li> <Li> 1.4. 2 Fundraising </Li> <Li> 1.4. 3 Construction </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.5 Dedication </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 After dedication <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Lighthouse Board and War Department ( 1886 -- 1933 ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 Early National Park Service years ( 1933 -- 1982 ) </Li> <Li> 2.3 Renovation and rededication ( 1982 -- 2000 ) </Li> <Li> 2.4 Closures and reopenings ( 2001 -- present ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Access and attributes <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Location and tourism </Li> <Li> 3.2 Inscriptions , plaques , and dedications </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 UNESCO World Heritage Site <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Physical characteristics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Depictions </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Design and construction process </H2> <H3> Origin </H3> <P> According to the National Park Service , the idea for the Statue of Liberty was first proposed by \u00c9douard Ren\u00e9 de Laboulaye the president of the French Anti-Slavery Society and a prominent and important political thinker of his time . The project is traced to a mid-1865 conversation between de Laboulaye , a staunch abolitionist and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bartholdi , a sculptor . In after - dinner conversation at his home near Versailles , Laboulaye , an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War , is supposed to have said : `` If a monument should rise in the United States , as a memorial to their independence , I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort -- a common work of both our nations . '' The National Park Service , in a 2000 report , however , deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet , and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870 . In another essay on their website , the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences , `` With the abolition of slavery and the Union 's victory in the Civil War in 1865 , Laboulaye 's wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States . In order to honor these achievements , Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France . Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States , the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy . '' </P> Bartholdi 's design patent <P> According to sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi , who later recounted the story , Laboulaye 's comment was not intended as a proposal , but it inspired Bartholdi . Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III , Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye . Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects ; in the late 1860s , he approached Isma'il Pasha , Khedive of Egypt , a plan to build Progress or Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia , a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient Egyptian female fellah or peasant , robed and holding a torch aloft , at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said . Sketches and models were made of the proposed work , though it was never erected . There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal , the Colossus of Rhodes : an ancient bronze statue of the Greek god of the sun , Helios . This statue is believed to have been over 100 feet ( 30 m ) high , and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships . </P> <P> Any large project was further delayed by the Franco - Prussian War , in which Bartholdi served as a major of militia . In the war , Napoleon III was captured and deposed . Bartholdi 's home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians , and a more liberal republic was installed in France . As Bartholdi had been planning a trip to the United States , he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans . In June 1871 , Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic , with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye . </P> <P> Arriving at New York Harbor , Bartholdi focused on Bedloe 's Island ( now named Liberty Island ) as a site for the statue , struck by the fact that vessels arriving in New York had to sail past it . He was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the United States government -- it had been ceded by the New York State Legislature in 1800 for harbor defense . It was thus , as he put it in a letter to Laboulaye : `` land common to all the states . '' As well as meeting many influential New Yorkers , Bartholdi visited President Ulysses S. Grant , who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue . Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail , and met many Americans who he thought would be sympathetic to the project . But he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal , and he and Laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign . </P> Bartholdi 's Lion of Belfort <P> Bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in 1870 . The son of a friend of Bartholdi 's , American artist John LaFarge , later maintained that Bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his U.S. visit at La Farge 's Rhode Island studio . Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France . He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians . One of these was the Lion of Belfort , a monumental sculpture carved in sandstone below the fortress of Belfort , which during the war had resisted a Prussian siege for over three months . The defiant lion , 73 feet ( 22 m ) long and half that in height , displays an emotional quality characteristic of Romanticism , which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty . </P> <H3> Design , style , and symbolism </H3> Detail from a fresco by Constantino Brumidi in the U.S. Capitol in Washington , D.C. , showing two early symbols of America : Columbia ( left ) and the Indian princess <P> Bartholdi and Laboulaye considered how best to express the idea of American liberty . In early American history , two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation . One of these symbols , the personified Columbia , was seen as an embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France . Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess , which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans . The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty , derived from Libertas , the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome , especially among emancipated slaves . A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time , and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art , including Thomas Crawford 's Statue of Freedom ( 1863 ) atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building . </P> <P> Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries striving to evoke republican ideals commonly used representations of Libertas as an allegorical symbol . A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the Great Seal of France . However , Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix 's famed Liberty Leading the People ( 1830 ) . In this painting , which commemorates France 's Revolution of 1830 , a half - clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen . Laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution , and so Bartholdi 's figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes . Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work , Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch , representing progress , for the figure to hold . </P> <P> Crawford 's statue was designed in the early 1850s . It was originally to be crowned with a pileus , the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient Rome . Secretary of War Jefferson Davis , a Southerner who would later serve as President of the Confederate States of America , was concerned that the pileus would be taken as an abolitionist symbol . He ordered that it be changed to a helmet . Delacroix 's figure wears a pileus , and Bartholdi at first considered placing one on his figure as well . Instead , he used a diadem , or crown , to top its head . In so doing , he avoided a reference to Marianne , who invariably wears a pileus . The seven rays form a halo or aureole . They evoke the sun , the seven seas , and the seven continents , and represent another means , besides the torch , whereby Liberty enlightens the world . </P> <P> Bartholdi 's early models were all similar in concept : a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty , wearing a stola and pella ( gown and cloak , common in depictions of Roman goddesses ) and holding a torch aloft . According to popular accounts , the face was modeled after that of Charlotte Beysser Bartholdi , the sculptor 's mother , but Regis Huber , the curator of the Bartholdi Museum is on record as saying that this , as well as other similar speculations , have no basis in fact . He designed the figure with a strong , uncomplicated silhouette , which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering New York Bay to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward Manhattan . He gave it bold classical contours and applied simplified modeling , reflecting the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose . Bartholdi wrote of his technique : </P> Thomas Crawford 's Statue of Freedom <P> The surfaces should be broad and simple , defined by a bold and clear design , accentuated in the important places . The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared . By exaggerating the forms , in order to render them more clearly visible , or by enriching them with details , we would destroy the proportion of the work . Finally , the model , like the design , should have a summarized character , such as one would give to a rapid sketch . Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study , and that the artist , concentrating his knowledge , should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity . </P> <P> Bartholdi made alterations in the design as the project evolved . Bartholdi considered having Liberty hold a broken chain , but decided this would be too divisive in the days after the Civil War . The erected statue does rise over a broken chain , half - hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground . Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty 's left hand ; he settled on a tabula ansata , used to evoke the concept of law . Though Bartholdi greatly admired the United States Constitution , he chose to inscribe `` JULY IV MDCCLXXVI '' on the tablet , thus associating the date of the country 's Declaration of Independence with the concept of liberty . </P> <P> Bartholdi interested his friend and mentor , architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet - le - Duc , in the project . As chief engineer , Viollet - le - Duc designed a brick pier within the statue , to which the skin would be anchored . After consultations with the metalwork foundry Gaget , Gauthier & Co. , Viollet - le - Duc chose the metal which would be used for the skin , copper sheets , and the method used to shape it , repouss\u00e9 , in which the sheets were heated and then struck with wooden hammers . An advantage of this choice was that the entire statue would be light for its volume , as the copper need be only 0.094 inches ( 2.4 mm ) thick . Bartholdi had decided on a height of just over 151 feet ( 46 m ) for the statue , double that of Italy 's Sancarlone and the German statue of Arminius , both made with the same method . </P> <H3> Announcement and early work </H3> <P> By 1875 , France was enjoying improved political stability and a recovering postwar economy . Growing interest in the upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide it was time to seek public support . In September 1875 , he announced the project and the formation of the Franco - American Union as its fundraising arm . With the announcement , the statue was given a name , Liberty Enlightening the World . The French would finance the statue ; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal . The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France , though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia . French monarchists opposed the statue , if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye , who had recently been elected a senator for life . Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful , including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25 , 1876 , that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod . The piece was titled La Libert\u00e9 \u00e9clairant le monde , the French version of the statue 's announced name . </P> Stereoscopic image of right arm and torch of the Statue of Liberty , 1876 Centennial Exposition <P> Despite its initial focus on the elites , the Union was successful in raising funds from across French society . Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave , as did 181 French municipalities . Laboulaye 's political allies supported the call , as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War . Less idealistically , contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal . The copper may have come from multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in Visnes , Norway , though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples . According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York , 90,800 kilos ( 200,000 pounds ) was needed to build the statue , and the French copper industrialist Eug\u00e8ne Secr\u00e9tan donated 58,100 kilos ( 128,000 pounds ) of copper . </P> <P> Although plans for the statue had not been finalized , Bartholdi moved forward with fabrication of the right arm , bearing the torch , and the head . Work began at the Gaget , Gauthier & Co. workshop . In May 1876 , Bartholdi traveled to the United States as a member of a French delegation to the Centennial Exhibition , and arranged for a huge painting of the statue to be shown in New York as part of the Centennial festivities . The arm did not arrive in Philadelphia until August ; because of its late arrival , it was not listed in the exhibition catalogue , and while some reports correctly identified the work , others called it the `` Colossal Arm '' or `` Bartholdi Electric Light '' . The exhibition grounds contained a number of monumental artworks to compete for fairgoers ' interest , including an outsized fountain designed by Bartholdi . Nevertheless , the arm proved popular in the exhibition 's waning days , and visitors would climb up to the balcony of the torch to view the fairgrounds . After the exhibition closed , the arm was transported to New York , where it remained on display in Madison Square Park for several years before it was returned to France to join the rest of the statue . </P> <P> During his second trip to the United States , Bartholdi addressed a number of groups about the project , and urged the formation of American committees of the Franco - American Union . Committees to raise money to pay for the foundation and pedestal were formed in New York , Boston , and Philadelphia . The New York group eventually took on most of the responsibility for American fundraising and is often referred to as the `` American Committee '' . One of its members was 19 - year - old Theodore Roosevelt , the future governor of New York and president of the United States . On March 3 , 1877 , on his final full day in office , President Grant signed a joint resolution that authorized the President to accept the statue when it was presented by France and to select a site for it . President Rutherford B. Hayes , who took office the following day , selected the Bedloe 's Island site that Bartholdi had proposed . </P> <H3> Construction in France </H3> The statue 's head on exhibit at the Paris World 's Fair , 1878 <P> On his return to Paris in 1877 , Bartholdi concentrated on completing the head , which was exhibited at the 1878 Paris World 's Fair . Fundraising continued , with models of the statue put on sale . Tickets to view the construction activity at the Gaget , Gauthier & Co. workshop were also offered . The French government authorized a lottery ; among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a terracotta model of the statue . By the end of 1879 , about 250,000 francs had been raised . </P> <P> The head and arm had been built with assistance from Viollet - le - Duc , who fell ill in 1879 . He soon died , leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier . The following year , Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder Gustave Eiffel . Eiffel and his structural engineer , Maurice Koechlin , decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron truss tower . Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure , which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking . A secondary skeleton was attached to the center pylon , then , to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days , he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars which culminated in a mesh of metal straps , known as `` saddles '' , that were riveted to the skin , providing firm support . In a labor - intensive process , each saddle had to be crafted individually . To prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure , Eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac . </P> <P> Eiffel 's design made the statue one of the earliest examples of curtain wall construction , in which the exterior of the structure is not load bearing , but is instead supported by an interior framework . He included two interior spiral staircases , to make it easier for visitors to reach the observation point in the crown . Access to an observation platform surrounding the torch was also provided , but the narrowness of the arm allowed for only a single ladder , 40 feet ( 12 m ) long . As the pylon tower arose , Eiffel and Bartholdi coordinated their work carefully so that completed segments of skin would fit exactly on the support structure . The components of the pylon tower were built in the Eiffel factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois - Perret . </P> <P> The change in structural material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi to change his plans for the statue 's assembly . He had originally expected to assemble the skin on - site as the masonry pier was built ; instead he decided to build the statue in France and have it disassembled and transported to the United States for reassembly in place on Bedloe 's Island . </P> <P> In a symbolic act , the first rivet placed into the skin , fixing a copper plate onto the statue 's big toe , was driven by United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton . The skin was not , however , crafted in exact sequence from low to high ; work proceeded on a number of segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors . Some work was performed by contractors -- one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi 's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban . By 1882 , the statue was complete up to the waist , an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue . Laboulaye died in 1883 . He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps , builder of the Suez Canal . The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4 , 1884 , and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York . The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal ; by January 1885 , this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage . </P> Richard Morris Hunt 's pedestal under construction in June 1885 <P> The committees in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining funds for the construction of the pedestal . The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade . The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money : construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years ; it would ultimately take over three - and - a-half decades to complete . There was criticism both of Bartholdi 's statue and of the fact that the gift required Americans to foot the bill for the pedestal . In the years following the Civil War , most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation 's history , rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue . There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works -- the selection of Italian - born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism , even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen . Harper 's Weekly declared its wish that `` M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had ' gone the whole figure ' while they were about it , and given us statue and pedestal at once . '' The New York Times stated that `` no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances . '' Faced with these criticisms , the American committees took little action for several years . </P> Design Frank Leslie 's Illustrated Newspaper , June 1885 , showing ( clockwise from left ) woodcuts of the completed statue in Paris , Bartholdi , and the statue 's interior structure <P> The foundation of Bartholdi 's statue was to be laid inside Fort Wood , a disused army base on Bedloe 's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811 . Since 1823 , it had rarely been used , though during the Civil War , it had served as a recruiting station . The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven - point star . The statue 's foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast , greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean . In 1881 , the New York committee commissioned Richard Morris Hunt to design the pedestal . Within months , Hunt submitted a detailed plan , indicating that he expected construction to take about nine months . He proposed a pedestal 114 feet ( 35 m ) in height ; faced with money problems , the committee reduced that to 89 feet ( 27 m ) . </P> <P> Hunt 's pedestal design contains elements of classical architecture , including Doric portals , as well as some elements influenced by Aztec architecture . The large mass is fragmented with architectural detail , in order to focus attention on the statue . In form , it is a truncated pyramid , 62 feet ( 19 m ) square at the base and 39.4 feet ( 12.0 m ) at the top . The four sides are identical in appearance . Above the door on each side , there are ten disks upon which Bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states ( between 1876 and 1889 , there were 38 U.S. states ) , although this was not done . Above that , a balcony was placed on each side , framed by pillars . Bartholdi placed an observation platform near the top of the pedestal , above which the statue itself rises . According to author Louis Auchincloss , the pedestal `` craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty '' . The committee hired former army General Charles Pomeroy Stone to oversee the construction work . Construction on the 15 - foot - deep ( 4.6 m ) foundation began in 1883 , and the pedestal 's cornerstone was laid in 1884 . In Hunt 's original conception , the pedestal was to have been made of solid granite . Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans ; the final design called for poured concrete walls , up to 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) thick , faced with granite blocks . This Stony Creek granite came from the Beattie Quarry in Branford , Connecticut . The concrete mass was the largest poured to that time . </P> <P> Norwegian immigrant civil engineer Joachim Goschen Gi\u00e6ver designed the structural framework for the Statue of Liberty . His work involved design computations , detailed fabrication and construction drawings , and oversight of construction . In completing his engineering for the statue 's frame , Gi\u00e6ver worked from drawings and sketches produced by Gustave Eiffel . </P> Fundraising Unpacking of the face of the Statue of Liberty , which was delivered on June 17 , 1885 <P> Fundraising for the statue had begun in 1882 . The committee organized a large number of money - raising events . As part of one such effort , an auction of art and manuscripts , poet Emma Lazarus was asked to donate an original work . She initially declined , stating she could not write a poem about a statue . At the time , she was also involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled anti-Semitic pogroms in eastern Europe . These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus had never experienced . She saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue . The resulting sonnet , `` The New Colossus '' , including the iconic lines `` Give me your tired , your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free '' , is uniquely identified with the Statue of Liberty and is inscribed on a plaque in the museum in its base . </P> <P> Even with these efforts , fundraising lagged . Grover Cleveland , the governor of New York , vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884 . An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000 , sufficient to complete the project , also failed . The New York committee , with only $3,000 in the bank , suspended work on the pedestal . With the project in jeopardy , groups from other American cities , including Boston and Philadelphia , offered to pay the full cost of erecting the statue in return for relocating it . </P> <P> Joseph Pulitzer , publisher of the New York World , a New York newspaper , announced a drive to raise $100,000 -- the equivalent of $2.3 million today . Pulitzer pledged to print the name of every contributor , no matter how small the amount given . The drive captured the imagination of New Yorkers , especially when Pulitzer began publishing the notes he received from contributors . `` A young girl alone in the world '' donated `` 60 cents , the result of self denial . '' One donor gave `` five cents as a poor office boy 's mite toward the Pedestal Fund . '' A group of children sent a dollar as `` the money we saved to go to the circus with . '' Another dollar was given by a `` lonely and very aged woman . '' Residents of a home for alcoholics in New York 's rival city of Brooklyn -- the cities would not merge until 1898 -- donated $15 ; other drinkers helped out through donation boxes in bars and saloons . A kindergarten class in Davenport , Iowa , mailed the World a gift of $1.35 . As the donations flooded in , the committee resumed work on the pedestal . </P> Construction <P> On June 17 , 1885 , the French steamer Is\u00e8re , laden with the Statue of Liberty , reached the New York port safely . New Yorkers displayed their new - found enthusiasm for the statue , as the French vessel arrived with the crates holding the disassembled statue on board . Two hundred thousand people lined the docks and hundreds of boats put to sea to welcome the Is\u00e8re . After five months of daily calls to donate to the statue fund , on August 11 , 1885 , the World announced that $102,000 had been raised from 120,000 donors , and that 80 percent of the total had been received in sums of less than one dollar . </P> <P> Even with the success of the fund drive , the pedestal was not completed until April 1886 . Immediately thereafter , reassembly of the statue began . Eiffel 's iron framework was anchored to steel I - beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled . Once this was done , the sections of skin were carefully attached . Due to the width of the pedestal , it was not possible to erect scaffolding , and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections . Nevertheless , no one died during the construction . Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch 's balcony to illuminate it ; a week before the dedication , the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal , fearing that ships ' pilots passing the statue would be blinded . Instead , Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch -- which was covered with gold leaf -- and placed the lights inside them . A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs . After the skin was completed , renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted , co-designer of New York 's Central Park and Brooklyn 's Prospect Park , supervised a cleanup of Bedloe 's Island in anticipation of the dedication . </P> <H3> Dedication </H3> Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World ( 1886 ) by Edward Moran . Oil on canvas . The J. Clarence Davies Collection , Museum of the City of New York . <P> A ceremony of dedication was held on the afternoon of October 28 , 1886 . President Grover Cleveland , the former New York governor , presided over the event . On the morning of the dedication , a parade was held in New York City ; estimates of the number of people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million . President Cleveland headed the procession , then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America . General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade . The route began at Madison Square , once the venue for the arm , and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway , with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row . As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange , traders threw ticker tape from the windows , beginning the New York tradition of the ticker - tape parade . </P> <P> A nautical parade began at 12 : 45 p.m. , and President Cleveland embarked on a yacht that took him across the harbor to Bedloe 's Island for the dedication . De Lesseps made the first speech , on behalf of the French committee , followed by the chairman of the New York committee , Senator William M. Evarts . A French flag draped across the statue 's face was to be lowered to unveil the statue at the close of Evarts 's speech , but Bartholdi mistook a pause as the conclusion and let the flag fall prematurely . The ensuing cheers put an end to Evarts 's address . President Cleveland spoke next , stating that the statue 's `` stream of light shall pierce the darkness of ignorance and man 's oppression until Liberty enlightens the world '' . Bartholdi , observed near the dais , was called upon to speak , but he declined . Orator Chauncey M. Depew concluded the speechmaking with a lengthy address . </P> <P> No members of the general public were permitted on the island during the ceremonies , which were reserved entirely for dignitaries . The only females granted access were Bartholdi 's wife and de Lesseps 's granddaughter ; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people . The restriction offended area suffragists , who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island . The group 's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women 's right to vote . A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather . </P> <P> Shortly after the dedication , The Cleveland Gazette , an African American newspaper , suggested that the statue 's torch not be lit until the United States became a free nation `` in reality '' : </P> <P> `` Liberty enlightening the world , '' indeed ! The expression makes us sick . This government is a howling farce . It can not or rather does not protect its citizens within its own borders . Shove the Bartholdi statue , torch and all , into the ocean until the `` liberty '' of this country is such as to make it possible for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family , without being ku - kluxed , perhaps murdered , his daughter and wife outraged , and his property destroyed . The idea of the `` liberty '' of this country `` enlightening the world , '' or even Patagonia , is ridiculous in the extreme . </P> <H2> After dedication </H2> <H3> Lighthouse Board and War Department ( 1886 -- 1933 ) </H3> Statue of Liberty ca . 1900 Government poster using the Statue of Liberty to promote the sale of Liberty Bonds <P> When the torch was illuminated on the evening of the statue 's dedication , it produced only a faint gleam , barely visible from Manhattan . The World characterized it as `` more like a glowworm than a beacon . '' Bartholdi suggested gilding the statue to increase its ability to reflect light , but this proved too expensive . The United States Lighthouse Board took over the Statue of Liberty in 1887 and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch 's effect ; in spite of its efforts , the statue remained virtually invisible at night . When Bartholdi returned to the United States in 1893 , he made additional suggestions , all of which proved ineffective . He did successfully lobby for improved lighting within the statue , allowing visitors to better appreciate Eiffel 's design . In 1901 , President Theodore Roosevelt , once a member of the New York committee , ordered the statue 's transfer to the War Department , as it had proved useless as a lighthouse . A unit of the Army Signal Corps was stationed on Bedloe 's Island until 1923 , after which military police remained there while the island was under military jurisdiction . </P> <P> The statue rapidly became a landmark . Many immigrants who entered through New York saw it as a welcoming sight . Oral histories of immigrants record their feelings of exhilaration on first viewing the Statue of Liberty . One immigrant who arrived from Greece recalled , </P> <P> I saw the Statue of Liberty . And I said to myself , `` Lady , you 're such a beautiful ! ( sic ) You opened your arms and you get all the foreigners here . Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it , to do something , to be someone in America . '' And always that statue was on my mind . </P> <P> Originally , the statue was a dull copper color , but shortly after 1900 a green patina , also called verdigris , caused by the oxidation of the copper skin , began to spread . As early as 1902 it was mentioned in the press ; by 1906 it had entirely covered the statue . Believing that the patina was evidence of corrosion , Congress authorized US $62,800 ( equivalent to $1,673,969 in 2016 ) for various repairs , and to paint the statue both inside and out . There was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting . The Army Corps of Engineers studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin , `` softened the outlines of the Statue and made it beautiful . '' The statue was painted only on the inside . The Corps of Engineers also installed an elevator to take visitors from the base to the top of the pedestal . </P> <P> On July 30 , 1916 , during World War I , German saboteurs set off a disastrous explosion on the Black Tom peninsula in Jersey City , New Jersey , in what is now part of Liberty State Park , close to Bedloe 's Island . Carloads of dynamite and other explosives that were being sent to Britain and France for their war efforts were detonated , and seven people were killed . The statue sustained minor damage , mostly to the torch - bearing right arm , and was closed for ten days . The cost to repair the statue and buildings on the island was about US $100,000 ( equivalent to $2,200,917 in 2016 ) . The narrow ascent to the torch was closed for public - safety reasons , and it has remained closed ever since . </P> <P> That same year , Ralph Pulitzer , who had succeeded his father Joseph as publisher of the World , began a drive to raise US $30,000 ( equivalent to $660,275 in 2016 ) for an exterior lighting system to illuminate the statue at night . He claimed over 80,000 contributors , but failed to reach the goal . The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor -- a fact that was not revealed until 1936 . An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood . Gutzon Borglum , who later sculpted Mount Rushmore , redesigned the torch , replacing much of the original copper with stained glass . On December 2 , 1916 , President Woodrow Wilson pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights , successfully illuminating the statue . </P> <P> After the United States entered World War I in 1917 , images of the statue were heavily used in both recruitment posters and the Liberty Bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially . This impressed upon the public the war 's stated purpose -- to secure liberty -- and served as a reminder that embattled France had given the United States the statue . </P> <P> In 1924 , President Calvin Coolidge used his authority under the Antiquities Act to declare the statue a National Monument . The only successful suicide in the statue 's history occurred five years later , when a man climbed out of one of the windows in the crown and jumped to his death , glancing off the statue 's breast and landing on the base . </P> <H3> Early National Park Service years ( 1933 -- 1982 ) </H3> Bedloe 's Island in 1927 , showing the statue and army buildings . The eleven - pointed walls of Fort Wood , which still form the statue 's base , are visible . <P> In 1933 , President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the statue to be transferred to the National Park Service ( NPS ) . In 1937 , the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe 's Island . With the Army 's departure , the NPS began to transform the island into a park . The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) demolished most of the old buildings , regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island , and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear . The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue , temporarily removing the rays from the statue 's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced . Rusted cast - iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete ; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced , as well . Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal . The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938 . </P> <P> During World War II , the statue remained open to visitors , although it was not illuminated at night due to wartime blackouts . It was lit briefly on December 31 , 1943 , and on D - Day , June 6 , 1944 , when its lights flashed `` dot - dot - dot - dash '' , the Morse code for V , for victory . New , powerful lighting was installed in 1944 -- 1945 , and beginning on V-E Day , the statue was once again illuminated after sunset . The lighting was for only a few hours each evening , and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night , all night . In 1946 , the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away . </P> <P> In 1956 , an Act of Congress officially renamed Bedloe 's Island as Liberty Island , a change advocated by Bartholdi generations earlier . The act also mentioned the efforts to found an American Museum of Immigration on the island , which backers took as federal approval of the project , though the government was slow to grant funds for it . Nearby Ellis Island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument by proclamation of President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 . In 1972 , the immigration museum , in the statue 's base , was finally opened in a ceremony led by President Richard Nixon . The museum 's backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an immigration museum on Ellis Island . </P> September 26 , 1972 : President Richard Nixon visits the statue to open the American Museum of Immigration . The statue 's raised right foot is visible , showing that it is depicted moving forward . <P> In 1970 , Ivy Bottini led a demonstration at the statue where she and others from the National Organization for Women 's New York chapter draped an enormous banner over a railing which read `` WOMEN OF THE WORLD UNITE ! '' </P> <P> Beginning December 26 , 1971 , 15 anti-Vietnam War veterans occupied the statue , flying a US flag upside down from her crown . They left December 28 following a Federal Court order . The statue was also several times taken over briefly by demonstrators publicizing causes such as Puerto Rican independence , opposition to abortion , and opposition to US intervention in Grenada . Demonstrations with the permission of the Park Service included a Gay Pride Parade rally and the annual Captive Baltic Nations rally . </P> <P> A powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the American Bicentennial in 1976 . The statue was the focal point for Operation Sail , a regatta of tall ships from all over the world that entered New York Harbor on July 4 , 1976 , and sailed around Liberty Island . The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue . </P> <H3> Renovation and rededication ( 1982 -- 2000 ) </H3> July 4 , 1986 : First Lady Nancy Reagan ( in red ) reopens the statue to the public . Main article : Conservation - restoration of the Statue of Liberty See also : Liberty Weekend <P> The statue was examined in great detail by French and American engineers as part of the planning for its centennial in 1986 . In 1982 , it was announced that the statue was in need of considerable restoration . Careful study had revealed that the right arm had been improperly attached to the main structure . It was swaying more and more when strong winds blew and there was a significant risk of structural failure . In addition , the head had been installed 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) off center , and one of the rays was wearing a hole in the right arm when the statue moved in the wind . The armature structure was badly corroded , and about two percent of the exterior plates needed to be replaced . Although problems with the armature had been recognized as early as 1936 , when cast iron replacements for some of the bars had been installed , much of the corrosion had been hidden by layers of paint applied over the years . </P> <P> In May 1982 , President Ronald Reagan announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty -- Ellis Island Centennial Commission , led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca , to raise the funds needed to complete the work . Through its fundraising arm , the Statue of Liberty -- Ellis Island Foundation , Inc. , the group raised more than $350 million in donations . The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign . A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card , the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue . The campaign generated contributions of $1.7 million to the restoration project . </P> <P> In 1984 , the statue was closed to the public for the duration of the renovation . Workers erected the world 's largest free - standing scaffold , which obscured the statue from view . Liquid nitrogen was used to remove layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades , leaving two layers of coal tar , originally applied to plug leaks and prevent corrosion . Blasting with baking soda powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper . The restorers ' work was hampered by the asbestos - based substance that Bartholdi had used -- ineffectively , as inspections showed -- to prevent galvanic corrosion . Workers within the statue had to wear protective gear , dubbed `` moon suits '' , with self - contained breathing circuits . Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired , and new copper was added where necessary . The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at Bell Labs , which had a patina that closely resembled the statue 's ; in exchange , the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing . The torch , found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations , was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi 's unaltered torch . Consideration was given to replacing the arm and shoulder ; the National Park Service insisted that they be repaired instead . The original torch was removed and replaced in 1986 with the current one , whose flame is covered in 24 - carat gold . The torch reflects the sun 's rays in daytime and is lighted by floodlights at night . </P> Liberty Enlightening the World <P> The entire puddled iron armature designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced . Low - carbon corrosion - resistant stainless steel bars that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium , an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves . To prevent the ray and arm making contact , the ray was realigned by several degrees . The lighting was again replaced -- night - time illumination subsequently came from metal - halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue , showing off various details . Access to the pedestal , which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s , was renovated to create a wide opening framed by a set of monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation . A modern elevator was installed , allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal . An emergency elevator was installed within the statue , reaching up to the level of the shoulder . </P> <P> July 3 -- 6 , 1986 , was designated `` Liberty Weekend '' , marking the centennial of the statue and its reopening . President Reagan presided over the rededication , with French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in attendance . July 4 saw a reprise of Operation Sail , and the statue was reopened to the public on July 5 . In Reagan 's dedication speech , he stated , `` We are the keepers of the flame of liberty ; we hold it high for the world to see . '' </P> <H3> Closures and reopenings ( 2001 -- present ) </H3> The Statue of Liberty on September 11 , 2001 as the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center burn in the background <P> Following the September 11 attacks , the statue and Liberty Island were immediately closed to the public . The island reopened at the end of 2001 , while the pedestal and statue remained off - limits . The pedestal reopened in August 2004 , but the National Park Service announced that visitors could not safely be given access to the statue due to the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency . The Park Service adhered to that position through the remainder of the Bush administration . New York Congressman Anthony Weiner made the statue 's reopening a personal crusade . On May 17 , 2009 , President Barack Obama 's Secretary of the Interior , Ken Salazar , announced that as a `` special gift '' to America , the statue would be reopened to the public as of July 4 , but that only a limited number of people would be permitted to ascend to the crown each day . </P> <P> The statue , including the pedestal and base , closed on October 29 , 2011 , for installation of new elevators and staircases and to bring other facilities , such as restrooms , up to code . The statue was reopened on October 28 , 2012 , only to close again a day later due to Hurricane Sandy . Although the storm did not harm the statue , it destroyed some of the infrastructure on both Liberty Island and Ellis Island , severely damaging the dock used by the ferries bearing visitors to the statue . On November 8 , 2012 , a Park Service spokesperson announced that both islands would remain closed for an indefinite period for repairs to be done . Due to lack of electricity on Liberty Island , a generator was installed to power temporary floodlights to illuminate the statue at night . The superintendent of Statue of Liberty National Monument , David Luchsinger , whose home on the island was severely damaged , stated that it would be `` optimistically ... months '' before the island was reopened to the public . The statue and Liberty Island reopened to the public on July 4 , 2013 . Ellis Island remained closed for repairs for several more months but reopened in late October 2013 . For part of October 2013 , Liberty Island was closed to the public due to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 , along with other federally funded museums , parks , monuments , construction projects and buildings . </P> <P> On October 7 , 2016 , construction started on a new Statue of Liberty museum on Liberty Island . The new $70 million , 26,000 - square - foot ( 2,400 m ) museum will be able to accommodate all of the island 's visitors when it opens in 2019 , as opposed to the current museum , which only 20 % of the island 's visitors can visit . The original torch will be relocated here , and in addition to exhibits relating to the statue 's construction and history , there will be a theater where visitors can watch an aerial view of the statue . The museum , designed by FXFOWLE Architects , will integrate with the parkland around it . It is being funded privately by Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg , Michael Bloomberg , Jeff Bezos , Coca - Cola , NBCUniversal , the family of Laurence Tisch and Preston Robert Tisch , Mellody Hobson , and George Lucas . Von F\u00fcrstenberg heads the fundraising for the museum , and the project had garnered more than $40 million in fundraising as of groundbreaking . </P> <H2> Access and attributes </H2> <H3> Location and tourism </H3> Tourists aboard a Circle Line ferry arriving at Liberty Island , June 1973 <P> The statue is situated in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island south of Ellis Island , which together comprise the Statue of Liberty National Monument . Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800 . As agreed in an 1834 compact between New York and New Jersey that set the state border at the bay 's midpoint , the original islands remain New York territory despite their location on the New Jersey side of the state line . Liberty Island is one of the islands that are part of the borough of Manhattan in New York . Land created by reclamation added to the 2.3 acres ( 0.93 ha ) original island at Ellis Island is New Jersey territory . </P> <P> No charge is made for entrance to the national monument , but there is a cost for the ferry service that all visitors must use , as private boats may not dock at the island . A concession was granted in 2007 to Statue Cruises to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities , replacing Circle Line , which had operated the service since 1953 . The ferries , which depart from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and Battery Park in Lower Manhattan , also stop at Ellis Island when it is open to the public , making a combined trip possible . All ferry riders are subject to security screening , similar to airport procedures , prior to boarding . Visitors intending to enter the statue 's base and pedestal must obtain a complimentary museum / pedestal ticket along with their ferry ticket . Those wishing to climb the staircase within the statue to the crown purchase a special ticket , which may be reserved up to a year in advance . A total of 240 people per day are permitted to ascend : ten per group , three groups per hour . Climbers may bring only medication and cameras -- lockers are provided for other items -- and must undergo a second security screening . </P> <H3> Inscriptions , plaques , and dedications </H3> The Statue of Liberty stands on Liberty Island . <P> There are several plaques and dedicatory tablets on or near the Statue of Liberty . </P> <Ul> <Li> A plaque on the copper just under the figure in front declares that it is a colossal statue representing Liberty , designed by Bartholdi and built by the Paris firm of Gaget , Gauthier et Cie ( Cie is the French abbreviation analogous to Co . ) . </Li> <Li> A presentation tablet , also bearing Bartholdi 's name , declares the statue is a gift from the people of the Republic of France that honors `` the Alliance of the two Nations in achieving the Independence of the United States of America and attests their abiding friendship . '' </Li> <Li> A tablet placed by the New York committee commemorates the fundraising done to build the pedestal . </Li> <Li> The cornerstone bears a plaque placed by the Freemasons . </Li> <Li> In 1903 , a bronze tablet that bears the text of Emma Lazarus 's sonnet , `` The New Colossus '' ( 1883 ) , was presented by friends of the poet . Until the 1986 renovation , it was mounted inside the pedestal ; today it resides in the Statue of Liberty Museum , in the base . </Li> <Li> `` The New Colossus '' tablet is accompanied by a tablet given by the Emma Lazarus Commemorative Committee in 1977 , celebrating the poet 's life . </Li> </Ul> <P> A group of statues stands at the western end of the island , honoring those closely associated with the Statue of Liberty . Two Americans -- Pulitzer and Lazarus -- and three Frenchmen -- Bartholdi , Eiffel , and Laboulaye -- are depicted . They are the work of Maryland sculptor Phillip Ratner . </P> <H2> UNESCO World Heritage site </H2> <P> In 1984 , the Statue of Liberty was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The UNESCO `` Statement of Significance '' describes the statue as a `` masterpiece of the human spirit '' that `` endures as a highly potent symbol -- inspiring contemplation , debate and protest -- of ideals such as liberty , peace , human rights , abolition of slavery , democracy and opportunity .

A smaller version of the statue , one - fourth the height of the original , was given by the American community in Paris to that city . It now stands on the \u00cele aux Cygnes , facing west toward her larger sister . A replica 30 feet ( 9.1 m ) tall stood atop the Liberty Warehouse on West 64th Street in Manhattan for many years ; it now resides at the Brooklyn Museum . In a patriotic tribute , the Boy Scouts of America , as part of their Strengthen the Arm of Liberty campaign in 1949 -- 1952 , donated about two hundred replicas of the statue , made of stamped copper and 100 inches ( 2,500 mm ) in height , to states and municipalities across the United States . Though not a true replica , the statue known as the Goddess of Democracy temporarily erected during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 was similarly inspired by French democratic traditions -- the sculptors took care to avoid a direct imitation of the Statue of Liberty . Among other recreations of New York City structures , a replica of the statue is part of the exterior of the New York - New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas . </P> Head of Liberty , U.S. airmail stamp , 1971 issue Reverse side of a Presidential Dollar coin <P> As an American icon , the Statue of Liberty has been depicted on the country 's coinage and stamps . It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial , and on New York 's 2001 entry in the state quarters series . An image of the statue was chosen for the American Eagle platinum bullion coins in 1997 , and it was placed on the reverse , or tails , side of the Presidential Dollar series of circulating coins . Two images of the statue 's torch appear on the current ten - dollar bill . The statue 's intended photographic depiction on a 2010 forever stamp proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino . </P> <P> Depictions of the statue have been used by many regional institutions . Between 1986 and 2000 , New York State issued license plates with an outline of the statue to either the front or the side of the serial number . The Women 's National Basketball Association 's New York Liberty use both the statue 's name and its image in their logo , in which the torch 's flame doubles as a basketball . The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League depicted the statue 's head on their third jersey , beginning in 1997 . The National Collegiate Athletic Association 's 1996 Men 's Basketball Final Four , played at New Jersey 's Meadowlands Sports Complex , featured the statue in its logo . The Libertarian Party of the United States uses the statue in its emblem . </P> <P> The statue is a frequent subject in popular culture . In music , it has been evoked to indicate support for American policies , as in Toby Keith 's song `` Courtesy of the Red , White and Blue ( The Angry American ) '' , and in opposition , appearing on the cover of the Dead Kennedys ' album Bedtime for Democracy , which protested the Reagan administration . In film , the torch is the setting for the climax of director Alfred Hitchcock 's 1942 movie Saboteur . The statue makes one of its most famous cinematic appearances in the 1968 picture Planet of the Apes , in which it is seen half - buried in sand . It is knocked over in the science - fiction film Independence Day and in Cloverfield the head is ripped off . In Jack Finney 's time - travel novel Time and Again , the right arm of the statue , on display in the early 1880s in Madison Square Park , plays a crucial role . Robert Holdstock , consulting editor of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction , wondered in 1979 , </P> <P> Where would science fiction be without the Statue of Liberty ? For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted ( E ) arth -- giants have uprooted it , aliens have found it curious ... the symbol of Liberty , of optimism , has become a symbol of science fiction 's pessimistic view of the future . </P> <H2> See also </H2> Approximate heights of various notable statues : 1 .

The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year , and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs . The contest is held in an American city , chosen three to four years beforehand , usually at warm - weather sites or domed stadiums . Since January 1971 , the winner of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs . </P> The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL -- NFL Championship Game ( Super Bowl I ) . <P> Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) , the two leagues met in four such contests . The first two were marketed as the `` AFL -- NFL World Championship Game '' , but were also casually referred to as `` the Super Bowl game '' during the television broadcast . Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the `` Super Bowl '' moniker in official marketing ; the names `` Super Bowl I '' and `` Super Bowl II '' were retroactively applied to the first two games . The NFC / NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 27 , while the AFC / AFL has won 25 . Twenty franchises , including teams that have relocated to another city , have won the Super Bowl . </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Steelers ( 6 -- 2 ) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships , while the New England Patriots ( 5 -- 5 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 5 -- 3 ) , and the San Francisco 49ers ( 5 -- 1 ) have five wins . New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with ten , while the Buffalo Bills ( 0 -- 4 ) have the most consecutive appearances with four ( all losses ) from 1990 to 1993 . The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances : 1972 -- 1974 . The Denver Broncos ( 3 -- 5 ) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls . The Minnesota Vikings ( 0 -- 4 ) and the Bills have lost four . The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the Green Bay Packers ( 1966 -- 1967 ) , the Miami Dolphins ( 1972 -- 1973 ) , the Pittsburgh Steelers ( 1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979 , the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the San Francisco 49ers ( 1988 -- 1989 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 1992 -- 1993 ) , the Denver Broncos ( 1997 -- 1998 ) , and the New England Patriots ( 2003 -- 2004 ) . Among those , Dallas ( 1992 -- 1993 ; 1995 ) and New England ( 2001 ; 2003 -- 2004 ) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls . The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII . The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position . Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns ( 1964 ) and Lions ( 1957 ) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Super Bowl Championship ( 1966 -- present ) <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Consecutive winners </Li> <Li> 1.2 Consecutive losers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Super Bowl appearances by team <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Teams with no Super Bowl appearances </Li> <Li> 2.2 Teams with long Super Bowl droughts </Li> <Li> 2.3 Teams with Super Bowl appearances but no victories </Li> <Li> 2.4 Super Bowl rematches </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Super Bowl championship ( 1966 -- present ) </H2> <P> Numbers in parentheses in the table are Super Bowl appearances as of the date of that Super Bowl and are used as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> Winning team and losing team columns indicate the number of times that team has appeared in a Super Bowl as well as each respective teams ' Super Bowl record to date . </Li> <Li> Venue column indicates number of times that stadium has hosted a Super Bowl . </Li> <Li> City column indicates number of times that metropolitan area has hosted a Super Bowl . </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Th> National Football League ( NFL , 1967 -- 1970 ) </Th> <Th> American Football League ( AFL , 1967 -- 1970 ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> NFL champion ( 4 , 2 -- 2 ) </Td> <Td> AFL champion ( 4 , 2 -- 2 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> National Football Conference ( NFC , 1971 -- present ) </Th> <Th> American Football Conference ( AFC , 1971 -- present ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> NFC champion ( 48 , 25 -- 23 ) </Td> <Td> AFC champion ( 48 , 23 -- 25 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Game </Th> <Th> Date </Th> <Th> Winning team </Th> <Th> Score </Th> <Th> Losing team </Th> <Th> Venue </Th> <Th> City </Th> <Th> Attendance </Th> <Th> Ref </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 01 !

His age is not mentioned . Phineas , along with his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher , star in the A-Plot of every episode . The series concerns Phineas 's attempts to avoid boredom by finding something new to do every day of the summer vacation . He does this with his less - talkative stepbrother Ferb , and often with many other neighborhood children . He is known to be very selfless and energetic . Phineas has many catch phrases like `` Oh , there you are , Perry '' or `` Hey , Ferb ! I know what we 're going to do today ! '' and `` Hey , where 's Perry ? '' . </P> <P> Phineas comes from a blended family . The creators chose this arrangement because they considered it underused in children 's programming as well as from Marsh 's experiences in one . As a character , Phineas has received a positive critical response , with one reviewer describing him and his brother as a `` comical pairing . '' Phineas appears in Phineas and Ferb merchandise , including plush toys , t - shirts , and a video game . </P> <H3> Ferbs `` Ferb '' Fletcher </H3> Main article : Ferb Fletcher <P> Ferb Fletcher ( voiced by Thomas Sangster ) is a boy of few words , Phineas 's green - haired , intelligent but laconic stepbrother from the United Kingdom and created by Phineas and Ferb co-founders Dan Povenmire and Jeff `` Swampy '' Marsh . He first appeared in the show 's pilot episode , `` Rollercoaster . '' </P> <P> Ferb and his stepbrother Phineas Flynn spend their days during their summer vacation having fun . They are featured in every episode 's A-Plot constructing large scale inventions or taking part in other outlandish activities . Ferb , an engineering genius , allows Phineas to do most of the talking for the pair and is described as `` more of a man of action , '' by Phineas , which makes him more of a plot device than a developed character . Ferb is more likely to sing than speak , but most often has a one - liner in the episodes . Ferb is named after a friend of the show 's creators who was an expert on tools and , at times , stayed rather silent . </P> <H3> Candace Flynn </H3> Main article : Candace Flynn <P> Candace Flynn ( voiced by Ashley Tisdale ) is Phineas 's fifteen - year - old older sister and Ferb 's stepsister . She first appeared in the pilot episode . Candace does not approve of the inventions her brothers create then she hates their creations , and in most episodes she attempts to `` bust her brothers '' by showing their mom . Her best friend is Stacy Hirano ; Candace also has an obvious crush on Jeremy Johnson , but for a long time she was oblivious to the fact he liked her back . As a character , she has received a positive critical acclaim , having appeared in other media such as video games . </P> <H3> Perry the Platypus </H3> Main article : Perry the Platypus <P> Perry the Platypus ( vocal effects by Dee Bradley Baker ) , a.k.a. Agent P , is Phineas and Ferb 's pet platypus and first appeared along with a large portion of the main cast in the pilot episode `` Rollercoaster . '' Perry is featured as the star of the B - Plot for all but one episode of the series alongside his arch - nemesis Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz . In the end , he pretends to destroy Phineas and Ferb 's creations . He is a primarily silent character , with the only noises being the occasional rattling of his bill . </P> <P> In Phineas and Ferb the Movie : Across the 2nd Dimension , an alternate reality ( yet more evil and ruthless ) version of Perry ( known as Platyborg ) appears . Platyborg would later return in the episode sequel , Tales from the Resistance : Back to the 2nd Dimension . </P> <H3> Dr. Doofenshmirtz </H3> Main article : Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz <P> Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz ( voiced by Dan Povenmire ) is a mad scientist appearing in all but one episode 's B - Plots thus far . He is the father to teenage Vanessa Doofenshmirtz and is the head of his own company , Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc . Depending on the episode , Dr. Doofenshmirtz 's main goal is to either destroy or rule the Tri-State Area which was suggested to him as a starting point before trying to take over the world . Routinely bumbling , incompetent , and forgetful , almost all of Doofenshmirtz 's plans -- always involving various gadgets and inventions -- have been thwarted by Perry the Platypus . However , a few of his schemes were quite successful , such as in the 2014 special Phineas and Ferb Save Summer when Doofenshmirtz moved the Earth away from its original orbit to bring on an early autumn , much to Perry 's distress . After most defeats , he shouts his catchphrase , `` Curse you , Perry the Platypus ! '' </P> <P> His contraptions are almost all named `` ( something ) - inator '' , and in `` Unfair Science Fair '' it is revealed that his first invention as a child was simply called `` Inator '' . </P> <P> Throughout the series , Doofenshmirtz 's flashbacks ( which are often shown after Perry has been captured ) explore his mentally abusive and lonely childhood growing up in the fictional village Gimmelshtump , Druelselstein . Before becoming an evil scientist , Doofenshmirtz was a bratwurst vendor until being put out of business by the hot dog industry . Doofenshmirtz usually monologues and displays acts of cartoon - style physical violence towards his nemesis Perry , a skilled anthropomorphic platypus secret agent . His last name is frequently abbreviated to `` Doof '' . Doofenshmirtz appears in several merchandise pieces , particularly the book series , and the video game . </P> <P> In the 2011 TV film , Phineas and Ferb the Movie : Across the 2nd Dimension , an alternate reality ( yet more intelligent and successful ) version of Dr. Doofenshmirtz appears , with the regular Doctor Doofenshmirtz serving as a supporting character . 2nd Doofenshmirtz later returns in the episode sequel , Tales from the Resistance : Back to the 2nd Dimension . </P> <H2> Secondary characters </H2> <H3> Baljeet Tjinder </H3> <P> Baljeet Tjinder ( voiced by Maulik Pancholy ) is Phineas ' and Ferb 's friend and neighbor . He wears blue overalls , despite being in grade school . A shy , intellectual , and polite boy who moved to Danville from India , he often helps the boys with their ideas and displays his knowledge of algebra and trivia . He also has a compulsive need to get good grades . </P> <H3> Carl the intern </H3> <P> Carl the Intern ( Tyler Alexander Mann ) is Major Monogram 's young unpaid intern of the O.W.C.A. ( Organization Without a Cool Acronym ) in charge of video taping Monogram when he is being interviewed and talking to Agent P. He is a bit careless , wears glasses , and sometimes forgets to focus the camera correctly . </P> <H3> Fireside Girls </H3> <P> The Fireside Girls are a group of ten girl scout - like girls led by Isabella in troop 46231 . Isabella and the other Fireside Girls usually help Phineas and Ferb in their projects which , in turn , are at times created to help the Fireside Girls with a humanitarian cause . </P> <P> Other members of the troop : </P> <Ul> <Li> Gretchen ( voiced by Ariel Winter ) wears glasses and has short auburn hair . She is second in command in the troop and the first ( besides Isabella ) who had been addressed by name . </Li> <Li> Holly ( voiced by Cymphonique Miller , Diamond White , Dana Davis ) </Li> <Li> Katie ( voiced by Isabella Acres , Soleil McGhee ) </Li> <Li> Milly ( voiced by Isabella Murad , Dannah Phirman ) </Li> <Li> Adyson Sweetwater ( voiced by Madison Pettis ) The second member of the troop to be addressed by name , and the first to have been given a last name as well . </Li> <Li> Ginger Hirano ( voiced by Tiffany Espensen , Michaela Zee , Ming - Na ) The younger sister of Candace 's best friend Stacy . She has a crush on Baljeet . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Lawrence Fletcher </H3> <P> Lawrence Fletcher ( voiced by Richard O'Brien ) is the father of Ferb and stepfather of Phineas and Candace . Lawrence sells antiques , is from the United Kingdom and is portrayed like a sitcom dad as being scatterbrained and unaware of what is going on . He often agrees to follow Phineas 's instructions and even forces Candace to cooperate as if he considers Phineas and Ferb 's skills normal . Unlike the boys ' mother , he has seen some of the boys ' inventions ; he has not reacted negatively , and apparently believes that their mother approves . His precise surname is a matter of some dispute ; in at least one episode , Isabella addresses him as `` Mr. Flynn '' . Jeff `` Swampy '' Marsh has said that Lawrence Fletcher is very similar to his stepfather , Bill . </P> <H3> Linda Flynn - Fletcher </H3> <P> Linda Flynn - Fletcher ( voiced by Caroline Rhea ) is the mother of Phineas and Candace and stepmother of Ferb . Unaware of the large - scale projects that Phineas and Ferb create on a daily basis , Candace often drags her away from other interests in an attempt to get the boys in trouble . Each creation is somehow destroyed or eliminated moments before `` Mom '' arrives , leaving Candace dumbfounded and Linda reluctant to believe Candace . Linda was also a one - hit wonder known as `` Lindana '' with her song , `` I 'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun '' . That fact possibly makes her , as a singer , a parody of Cyndi Lauper , because of Lauper 's hit Girls Just Want to Have Fun , and because both of them were famous singers in the 1980s ( Linda fictionally ) . Her single is used as elevator music throughout the series . Her surname is not consistent throughout the series ; in at least one episode , Candace refers to her as `` Linda Flynn '' . She is based on Dan Povenmire 's sister , also named Linda . She also used to date Dr. Doofenshmirtz during their mid-teens and that she was the one who inspired him to take over the Tri-State Area as a starting point for worldwide domination when he sarcastically stated that he would rule the world . </P> <H3> Isabella Garcia - Shapiro </H3> <P> Isabella Garcia - Shapiro ( voiced by Alyson Stoner ) is a Jewish Mexican girl . She is one of the brothers ' best friends and has an obvious crush on Phineas Flynn of which he is unaware , though he has shown he cares for her from time to time . She is known for the catchphrase , `` Whatcha doin ' ? '' and is the leader of the Fireside Girls troop 46231 . The troop often helps Phineas and Ferb in their projects . She is named after series creator Dan Povenmire 's oldest daughter . </P> <H3> Stacy Hirano </H3> <P> Stacy Hirano ( voiced by Kelly Hu ) is Candace 's best friend . She is of Japanese heritage . Stacy is shown to be annoyed by Candace 's constant attempts to bust Phineas and Ferb , and would prefer to just have fun with the inventions ; she also occasionally gets annoyed with Candace 's gushing about her relationship with Jeremy . During the episode `` Happy Birthday , Isabella '' , she finds out about Perry 's secret Identity but does n't lose her memories afterwards . </P> <H3> Jeremy Johnson </H3> <P> Jeremy Johnson ( voiced by Mitchel Musso ) is Candace Flynn 's crush and later boyfriend . His age is sixteen , a year older than Candace . He works at Mr. Slushy Burger ( sometimes named Mr. Slushy Dawg ) . In `` Summer Belongs to You , '' it was confirmed that he and Candace had become boyfriend and girlfriend ; toward the end of the episode , they kissed . He also has a band called `` The Incidentals . '' </P> <H3> Major Monogram </H3> <P> Major Francis Monogram ( voiced by Jeff `` Swampy '' Marsh ) is one of the heads of the O.W.C.A. ( Organization Without a Cool Acronym ) Department and Perry the Platypus ' boss . He usually appears in a Nehru jacket on a giant screen giving Perry instructions for his next mission to stop Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz 's endless attempts to take over the Tri-State Area . His uniform prominently features the initials `` MM . '' He has a monobrow and wears a toup\u00e9e . Sometimes , he is shown to have a lack of details about what Doofenshmirtz is up to , and orders Perry to go stop it as usual . Just like Doofenshmirtz , he has appeared in every episode of the series to date except , `` Isabella and the Temple of Sap . '' </P> <H3> Buford van Stomm </H3> <P> Buford van Stomm ( voiced by Bobby Gaylor ) is frequently referred to as a bully , but he rarely hurts anyone on - screen . He is portrayed as a nice person with a tough guy attitude more often than as a bully . Phineas believes that Buford only bullies out of boredom thus Phineas often invites him to keep his mind occupied . He is thought not to get along with Baljeet , but in most episodes it is shown that they share a friendly bond . In one episode , Buford and Baljeet sing a song where they describe each other as `` Frenemies '' and `` my least favorite brother '' . </P> <H3> Vanessa Doofenshmirtz </H3> <P> Vanessa Doofenshmirtz ( voiced by Olivia Olson ) is Heinz and Charlene Doofenshmirtz 's teenage daughter . She is sarcastic , mild - mannered , cynical , and dresses in a goth style . Vanessa is aware that her father is an evil scientist and knows about her father 's nemesis Perry the Platypus . She is often exasperated by her father whenever he tries to establish a `` father - daughter '' bond between them as he does n't really understand her interests or refuses to acknowledge that she is growing up and often assumes that she is also interested in `` evil . '' She often tries to convince her mom that her dad is an `` evil scientist '' but , much like Candace , ultimately always fails when she does appear trying to catch him in the act , much to her dismay . She does , however , occasionally show appreciation for what he does for her , as he is clearly devoted to her ( he once taught her how to drive and traveled halfway around the world after she got lost ) . Also , despite denying it so many times , Vanessa admits that she may be a little evil , as she once helped her father escape from custody by posing her hairdryer as a pistol to fool Major Monogram and Perry into releasing Doofenshmirtz , as shown in the special Phineas and Ferb : Summer Belongs to You ! . Although Ferb has a crush on her , she remains oblivious to his affections as she already had a punk ( not visigoth ) boyfriend named `` Johnny . '' , whom she later broke up with in the episode `` Minor Monogram '' . She is in a relationship with Monty Monogram , the son of Major Monogram ; however `` Act Your Age '' depicts her becoming involved with Ferb ten years down the line . </P> <P> In addition to this , Vanessa makes a cameo appearance in the 2011 TV film , `` Phineas and Ferb : Across the 2nd Dimension '' , along with an alternative reality version of herself ( 2nd Vanessa ) , though their scenes were deleted . 2nd Vanessa returned in the episode sequel , Tales from the Resistance : Back to the 2nd Dimension . </P> <H2> Recurring characters </H2> <H3> Vivian Garcia - Shapiro </H3> <P> Vivian Garcia - Shapiro ( voiced by Eileen Galindo ) , or simply `` Viv , '' is Isabella 's mother and lives across the street from Phineas and Ferb . She is a Jewish Mexican , one of Linda 's best friends , and plays upright bass in a jazz band with Linda Flynn and Jeremy 's mom . She is known for talking very fast and often making useless comments such as , `` Oh , Candace , look how tall you 've gotten . '' despite seeing Candace only a week earlier . </P> <H3> Jenny Brown </H3> <P> Jenny Brown ( voiced by Alyson Stoner ) is Candace 's second best friend and a hippie . She wears a peace symbol necklace and says that she hopes for world peace . </P> <H3> Pinky </H3> <P> Pinky ( vocals by Dee Bradley Baker ) is Isabella 's pet chihuahua . Much like Perry the Platypus , Pinky also lives a double - life as a secret agent for the O.W.C.A. under the codename , `` Agent Pinky '' in a division run by a commander named Wanda , a.k.a. Admiral Acronym . Pinky 's nemesis is Professor Poofenplotz . Although he does not like dog food , Pinky will eat just about anything -- especially his favorite ; grilled cheese sandwiches , and even inedible objects , having once swallowed Isabella 's Fireside Girl sash . Pinky always shakes as an ongoing joke about the behavior of Chihuahuas . He first appeared in the episode , `` Journey to the Center of Candace . '' </P> <H3> Norm </H3> <P> Norm ( voiced by John Viener ) is a giant robot man created by Dr. Doofenshmirtz to destroy Perry the Platypus . Introduced in `` Greece Lightning , '' he is a giant robotic mild - mannered businessman who often says , `` The enemy of platypus is man . '' Norm has appeared in other episodes . For instance , in the episode , `` Traffic Cam Caper , '' Perry borrows Norm as a ride to steal the traffic cam disk , for it has evidence that Perry is a secret agent . He was once a part of the O.W.C.A. but was fired because he was not an animal . Later in the series , he is depicted as Doofenshmirtz 's sidekick and servant who makes frequent mistakes such as cooking eggs with the shells on or serving Doof chocolate cake for breakfast , though always staying cheery . In the episode `` A Real Boy '' , Norm reveals that he has always wanted to be a human boy and considers Doofenshmirtz his father and Vanessa his sister . </P> <P> In the 2011 TV film , Phineas and Ferb the Movie : Across the 2nd Dimension , a group of alternate reality ( yet more menacing and successful ) versions of Norm ( known as Norm - Bots ) appear , with the regular Norm making a cameo . </P> <H3> Charlene Doofenshmirtz </H3> <P> Charlene Doofenshmirtz ( voiced by Allison Janney ) is the former wife of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz and shares custody of their daughter , Vanessa . Unaware of Dr. Doofenshmirtz 's `` evil '' side , and in fact saying she does not believe someone can ever be truly evil , she divorced him due to a lack of common interests and having different life - goals . She is very wealthy and gives her ex-husband a large allowance each month . She is sometimes called by Vanessa who tries to `` bust '' her father but to no avail . Charlene and Linda Flynn - Fletcher have been paired up in a cooking class owned by Chef Pierre and in `` I Scream , You Scream '' were distracted by both Candace and Vanessa at the same time . Despite being divorced with Doof , she still goes to Doofenshmirtz family reunions claiming that she `` kept the name , '' as seen in `` Thaddeus and Thor . '' </P> <P> However , in the episode `` Tales From the Resistance : Back to the 2nd Dimension '' ( the episode sequel to the 2011 TV film , `` Phineas and Ferb : Across the 2nd Dimension '' ) , it is shown that there is an alternate reality version of Charlene Doofenshmirtz . It turns out that 2nd Charlene is still married to 2nd Doof and actually shares much of his evil personality , and that their divorce was just a ruse to gain financial advantages during 2nd Doof 's reign ( such as receiving coupon mail , putting up junk yard sales , and going on separate vacation trips ) . </P> <H3> Suzy Johnson </H3> <P> Suzy Johnson ( voiced by Kari Wahlgren ) , known as Little Suzy Johnson , is Jeremy 's little sister . She has a high - pitched squeaky voice and appears very sweet and innocent . However , she is actually very spoiled and manipulative and very possessive over Jeremy , once telling Candace , `` There is only one girl in Jeremy 's life '' and thus will do anything to keep Candace away from her brother . </P> <H3> Grandpa Clyde and Grandma Betty Jo </H3> <P> Grandpa Clyde Flynn and Grandma Betty Jo Flynn ( voiced by Barry Bostwick and Caroline Rhea respectively ) are Linda 's parents , Phineas and Candace 's maternal grandparents , Lawrence 's - in - laws , and Ferb 's step - grandparents . Every summer , they invite the family along with many neighborhood kids to a lakehouse which Phineas calls , `` Camp P&F '' . Though they are old , they often participate in the kids ' capers . Grandpa Clyde , like Phineas and Ferb , has a great sense of mechanics , as seen in `` Crack That Whip ! '' Betty Jo is also shown in the same episode to have a fierce rivalry with Edna Hildagard , Jeremy and Suzy 's grandmother . </P> <H3> Grandpa Reginald and Grandma Winifred </H3> <P> Grandma Winifred Fletcher and Grandpa Reginald Fletcher ( voiced by Malcolm McDowell and Jane Carr ) are Lawrence 's parents , Ferb 's paternal grandparents , Phineas and Candace 's step grandparents , and Linda Flynn Fletcher 's in laws who reside in the United Kingdom . Reginald used to be a daredevil known as the Flying Fishmonger the anthem . </P> <H3> Roger Doofenshmirtz </H3> <P> Roger Doofenshmirtz ( voiced by John O'Hurley ) is mayor of Danville and Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz 's younger brother . Heinz often states angrily that Roger is their mother 's favorite son . In `` Tree to Get Ready '' Roger states that he is , `` the most handsome and charming man in the Tri-State area . '' </P> <H3> Irving Du Bois </H3> <P> Irving Du Bois ( voiced by Jack McBrayer ) is Phineas ' and Ferb 's self - proclaimed biggest fan . He always carries a scrapbook that he filled with images and souvenirs from Phineas and Ferb 's big ideas as well as a strand of Ferb 's hair . Irving has an older brother Albert , who is self - nicknamed ' The Truth Detector . ' </P> <H3> Django Brown </H3> <P> Django Brown ( voiced by Alec Holden ) is a friend of Phineas and Ferb . Django is the son of the artist Beppo Brown from `` Oil on Candace , '' who is famous for his work in making giant creations , from refrigerators to dental floss . He is named after co-creator's Jeff `` Swampy '' Marsh son , Django Marsh , who voices minor characters on the show . </P> <H3> Admiral Acronym </H3> <P> Admiral Wanda Acronym ( voiced by Jane Leeves ) is the one of the heads of the O.W.C.A. ( Organization Without a Cool Acronym ) Department and Pinky the Chihuahua ' boss . Just like Major Monogram , she usually appears on a giant screen giving Pinky instructions for his next mission to stop Professor Poofenplotz 's endless attempts to take over the world . </P> <P> Also , just like Monogram ( who has an unpaid intern named Carl ) , Adrimal Acronym has her own unpaid intern named Carla , who bears some resemblances to Carl . </P> <H3> Carla </H3> <P> Carla ( voiced by Jennifer Hale ) is one of the interns working for the O.W.C.A. . She bears some resemblances to Carl ( possible could be her brother or cousin ) , as her boss Admiral Acronym stated that she comes from an ' entire family of unpaid interns ' . She usually gives in the intelligence of whatever plans that Poofenplotz is up to . </P> <H3> Professor Poofenplotz </H3> <P> Professor Esmeralda Poofenplotz ( voiced by Amanda Plummer ) is an old mad scientist and the nemesis of Agent Pinky , Isabella 's pet Chihuahua . She is known for her silly attempts for worldwide domination . Her known schemes so far involve replacing handbags , stealing royal jelly , and searching for strong hairspray ( her favorite is `` Stiff Beauty '' hairspray , which originally was only used by clowns ) . Needless to say , because of her somewhat arrogant personality , Poofenplotz has failed to know about the flaws of her schemes . And because of that , it has allowed Pinky to defeat her in return , leaving an humiliated Poofenplotz to yell out , `` Curse you , Pinky the Chihuahua ! '' , similar to how Heinz Doofenshmirtz says whenever his plans get foiled by Perry the Platypus . </P> <H3> Love H\u00e4ndel </H3> <P> Love H\u00e4ndel is a rock band idolized by many in the Danville Tri-State Area , first seen the episode , `` Dude , We 're Gettin ' the Band Back Together ! '' Lawrence Fletcher and Linda Flynn shared their first kiss at a Love H\u00e4ndel concert . Shortly afterward , plagued by infighting caused by the pressures of a dwindling fanbase , Love H\u00e4ndel split up . Lead Singer Danny ( voiced by Jaret Reddick ) became the owner of Danny 's Music Shop . Bass Player Bobbi Fabulous ( voiced by Carlos Alazraqui ) became the owner of Bobbi 's Fashion Salon and Linda 's hairdresser . Sherman `` Swampy '' ( voiced by Steve Zahn ) ended up working at the Danville Public Library , believing he had lost his sense of rhythm . Eventually all three members are convinced to reunite for a concert in the Flynn / Fletcher 's backyard , in which they sing their hit song , `` You Snuck Your Way Right into My Heart . '' Love Handel occasionally reappears in other episodes and in the movie where they sing their songs . </P> <H3> Monty Monogram </H3> <P> Monty Monogram ( voiced by Seth Green ) is Major Monogram 's son and has been working in O.W.C.A. since `` Minor Monogram '' . Vanessa Doofenshmirtz seems to become interested in him after she broke up with Johnny , and it is possible that he is slightly interested in her too because he winks at her before leaving . They have coffee together in `` Sipping with the Enemy '' , at which point they apparently begin to date one another . In `` Minor Monogram '' he has recently graduated from the `` High School Without a Cool Acronym '' ( H.S.W.C.A. ) and he really wants to fight evil following his dad 's footsteps . Due to the rivalry between his father and Dr. Doofenshmirtz , he and Vanessa try to keep it secret from the two of them , aided by Perry and Carl ( though the latter briefly blackmailed Monty in hopes of getting his help in earning Major Monogram 's approval ) . In the special Phineas and Ferb Save Summer , Monty played a major role as he attempts to help rescue all of the captured agents and defeat the villains of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. in their plan to take over the world by sending it into a new Ice Age . </P> <H3> Dr. Hirano </H3> <P> Dr. Hirano ( voiced by Ming - Na Wen ) is Stacy and Ginger 's mother . She removed Isabella 's tonsils in , `` I Scream , You Scream . '' She is often referred to through conversations between Candace and Stacy where Candace gratifies , `` Stacy , you 're a genius ! '' and Stacy replies , `` Could you call my mom and tell her that ? '' </P> <H3> Rodney </H3> <P> Aloyse Everheart Elizabeth Otto Wolfgang Hypatia Gunther Galen Gary Cooper von Roddenstein ( voiced by Joe Orrantia ) , or Rodney for short , is a bald evil scientist and a member of the villain organization L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. . He serves as the main rival to Dr. Doofenshmirtz , believing him to a disappointment because of his constant failures . Throughout most of his appearances , Rodney attempts to best out on Doofenshmirtz to show that he 's a better villain , only to fail so many times ( either due to Doofenshmirtz 's antics or Perry 's intervention ) . Similar to Doofenshmirtz , Rodney usually makes his own inventions and ends them with the suffix ' - inizor ' . He also has his own robot apprentice named Chloe , whom Norm fell in love with . He also has a son named Orville , who usually helps him create his - inizors . </P> <P> Rodney would later go on to appear in the 2014 episode special , `` Phineas and Ferb Save Summer '' , where he learns that Doofenshmirtz has actually succeeded in moving the Earth away from the Sun to an early autumn with his latest - inator . Taking the opportunity to exploit this , Rodney leads L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. into revealing themselves to the world and capturing all of O.W.C.A. 's agents . He even creates an - inizor ( which is just ten times the size and strength of Doof 's - inator ) that will send the Earth into a new Ice Age if the world refuse to meet all of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. 's demands . However , in the end , Doofenshmirtz ( who is completely disgusted by Rodney 's true goal for worldwide domination ) manages to defeat Rodney , who then gets arrested by Monty Monogram and taken into O.W.C.A. custody . </P> <H3> Professor Parenthesis </H3> <P> Professor Parenthesis ( voiced by Paul Reubens ) is an evil scientist serving in the 2015 standalone special , O.W.C.A. Files . He has claimed to have known Major Monogram during biology class 30 years ago ( even announcing several names of their old classmates ) . In the special , Parenthesis plots to take over O.W.C.A. by using robotic fleas to take control of all of its animal agents , so that he can unleash them to wreak havoc around the world in order to smear O.W.C.A. 's good name . During the climax , he is revealed to be a tiny talking flea controlling a human android , as he plans to capture Perry ( who is among the few agents not be infested with the robotic fleas ) while finalizing his control over the agents to become permanent . However , Perry 's team of trainees ( including Doofenshmirtz , who has given up evil at that time ) set up a trap against Parenthesis , destroy his robotic fleas to free the agents , and confine Parenthesis inside a pill bottle as punishment for his crimes . </P> <H2> Minor characters </H2> <P> There are several characters that reappear as recurring joke such as farmer and wife . The wife always tells her husband `` I ca n't believe you ( blank ) without getting a ( blank ) '' and then it falls from the sky and sometimes hits her . For example , in the episode , `` Leave the Busting to Us '' , the wife says , `` I ca n't believe you bought a bunny farm but forgot to buy any bunnies ! Did you really think the bunnies would fall from the sky ? '' A pack of rabbits then falls from the sky and hits her . Then in the end credits scene from said episode , the wife yells at her husband , `` I ca n't believe you sold our lucrative bunny farm and bought a van rental place ! And you did n't buy a single van ! '' She hears a van falling over her and says , `` Not one word , '' just before the van crashes and injures her ( the screen blacks out the impact ) . </P> <P> Another minor character is the Giant Floating Baby Head . In an interview , Dan Povenmire stated that the head had originated from a storyboard panel that writer Mike Diederich had drawn which director Rob Hughes found hilarious enough to create an entire bit around . It first appears in `` One Good Scare Ought to Do It ! '' and has since appeared in several other episode . </P> <P> Dr. Doofenshmirtz 's mother ( Cloris Leachman ) has appeared . She refers to Roger being her favorite child and often ignores Heinz . Albert ( voiced by Diedrich Bader ) , Irving 's Brother has appeared in `` Not Phineas and Ferb '' , `` The Doof Side of the Moon '' , and `` Nerds of a Feather '' . </P> <H3> Celebrity guest stars </H3> <Ul> <Li> see the list of guest stars on Phineas and Ferb </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Writers : Bobby Gaylor , Martin Olson ; Director : Dan Povenmire . `` A Hard Days Knight '' .

He is a lawyer and was once known as `` the deadliest shot in Maycomb County '' . Although he was a good shot , he does not like to mention the fact as he does not like the thought of having an advantage over people . He appears to support racial equality and was appointed to represent Tom Robinson , a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman , Mayella Ewell . The town disapproves of him defending Tom especially when he makes clear his intent to defend Tom Robinson to the best of his abilities . He is portrayed by Gregory Peck in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <H3> `` Scout '' Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jean Louise `` Scout '' Finch is the narrator and To Kill a Mockingbird is told by an adult Scout who often comments on how she could not understand something at the time but now can appreciate it . She gets in trouble with her teacher Miss Caroline because Miss Caroline expects Scout to learn reading and writing her way . She is a tomboy and spends the most of her time with her brother Jem and best friend Dill . To Jem 's advice to pretend to be a lady and start sewing or something , she answers ' Hell no . ' The rare hints the narrator gives us about her grown - up life reveal that she ultimately has n't changed herself for others . </P> <P> She matures from age 6 to age 9 as the novel progresses but remains naive and idealistic , despite an increased understanding of human nature and racism in her town . At the beginning of the book , Scout is confused by some of the words and names she hears people directing towards her father , such as `` nigger - lover '' . Being only six , Scout does not know how to handle such situations so she tries to resolve her problems by fighting , or by talking to Atticus about what she has heard . By the end of the book , Scout realizes that racism does exist and comes to terms with its presence in her town . Scout also learns how to deal with others , including the Finch family housekeeper , Calpurnia , and her aunt , Alexandra . Scout is the only one of the novel 's primary three children ( Dill , Jem , and herself ) to see and speak to Boo Radley during the course of the novel and realize that he is harmless , despite her initial fear of him . She also stops a mob that is trying to lynch Tom Robinson by talking to the mob leader , Mr. Cunningham , about inviting his son , Walter , over for dinner . Mr. Cunningham then tells the other mob members to get back in their cars and leave them alone . The members listen , and Scout unintentionally saves Tom Robinson 's life . She is portrayed by Mary Badham in the film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> Notable quote : `` Until I feared I would lose it , I never loved to read . One does not love breathing . '' </P> <H3> `` Jem '' Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jeremy Atticus `` Jem '' Finch is Atticus ' son and Scout 's older brother by four years . Jem matures greatly throughout the course of the novel , much more affected by events than Scout seems to be . Being four years Scout 's senior , Jem is seen to have a greater understanding of - and therefore greater difficulty in navigating - the obstacles thrown their way . Jem is seen explaining many things to Scout throughout the novel . Bob Ewell breaks Jem 's arm during his assault on the Finch children , subsequently resulting in it being shorter than it had been , in an attempt to protect his sister . He is portrayed by Phillip Alford in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <H3> Dill Harris ( edit ) </H3> <P> Charles Baker `` Dill '' Harris is a short , smart boy who visits Maycomb every summer from Meridian , Mississippi , and stays with his Aunt Rachel ( Aunt Stephanie in the film ) . Dill is the best friend of both Jem and Scout , and his goal throughout the novel is to get Boo Radley to come out of his house . The children concoct many plans to lure Boo Radley out of his house for a few summers until Atticus tells them to stop . In chapter 5 of the novel , Dill promises to marry Scout and they become `` engaged '' . One night Dill runs away from his home in Meridian , arriving in Maycomb County where he hides under Scout 's bed . When she finds Dill , he tells both Scout and Atticus that he was chained to a wall in his father 's basement ; later , he confesses he actually ran away because he felt he was being replaced by his stepfather . Before Dill returned to Meridian after the summer , he went swimming with Jem at the Barker 's Eddy creek . Scout , unfortunately , was unable to participate , because both boys were swimming naked . </P> <P> Unlike Scout and Jem , Dill lacks the security of family support . He is unwanted and unloved by his mother and stepfather : `` They do get on a lot better without me , I can not help them any . '' As Francis ( a cousin of Jem and Scout ) says , `` He has n't got a home , he just gets passed around from relative to relative . '' Dill maintains he has no father ; he does n't know where his father might live , or if he will ever come back . He is played by John Megna in the film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> This character is believed to be based on author Truman Capote , a childhood friend of Harper Lee . </P> <H3> Calpurnia ( edit ) </H3> <P> Calpurnia , nicknamed Cal , is the Finch family 's African - American housekeeper , whom the children love and Atticus deeply respects ( he remarks in her defense that she `` never indulged ( the children ) like most colored nurses '' ) . She is highly regarded by Atticus . She is an important figure in Scout 's life , providing discipline , instruction , and love . She also fills the maternal role for the children after their mother 's death . Calpurnia is a mother herself and raised her son , Zeebo , to adulthood . Calpurnia is one of the few black characters in the novel who is able to read and write , and it is she who taught Scout to write . She learned how to read from Miss Maudie 's aunt , Miss Buford , who taught her how to read out of Blackstone 's Commentaries , a book given to her . Aunt Alexandra despised Calpurnia because Alexandra believed that Calpurnia was not a `` maternal figure '' for Jem and Scout , especially for Scout . </P> <P> Calpurnia is a member of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb . While Scout always hears her speak proper English , she is surprised to learn that Calpurnia does not do so at church , especially with the uneducated members of the congregation . </P> <P> While everyone in the novel is filtered through Scout 's perception , Calpurnia in particular appears for a long time more as Scout 's idea of her than as a real person . At the beginning of the novel , Scout appears to think of Calpurnia as the wicked stepmother to Scout 's own Cinderella . However , towards the end of the book , Scout views Calpurnia as someone she can look up to , and realizes Calpurnia has only protected her over the years . She is played by Estelle Evans in the film . </P> <H3> Arthur `` Boo '' Radley ( edit ) </H3> <P> Arthur `` Boo '' Radley is a recluse in To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> Maycomb children believe he is a horrible person , due to the rumors spread about him and a trial he underwent as a teenager . It is implied during the story that Boo is a very lonely man who attempts to reach out to Jem and Scout for love and friendship , such as leaving them small gifts and figures in a tree knothole . Scout finally meets him at the very end of the book , when he saves the children 's lives from Bob Ewell . Scout describes him as being sickly white , with a thin mouth , thin and feathery hair , and grey eyes , almost as if he were blind . During the same night , when Boo whispers to Scout to walk him back to the Radley house , Scout takes a moment to picture what it would be like to be Boo Radley . While standing on his porch , she realizes his `` exile '' inside his house is really not that lonely . </P> <P> Boo Radley 's heroics in protecting the children from Bob Ewell are covered up by Atticus , Sheriff Tate , and Scout . This can be read as a wise refusal of fame . As Tate notes , if word got out that Boo killed Ewell , Boo would be inundated with gifts and visits , calamitous for him due to his reclusive personality . The precocious Scout recognizes the danger : renown would `` kill the mockingbird '' . Boo Radley is a ghost who haunts the book yet manifests himself at just the right moments in just the right way . He is , arguably , the most potent character in the whole book and as such , inspires the other key characters to save him when he needs saving . </P> <P> After the Tom Robinson trial , Jem and Scout have a different understanding of Boo Radley . `` Scout , I think I 'm beginning to understand something . I think I 'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley 's stayed shut up in the house all this time ... it 's because he wants to stay inside . '' ( 23.117 ) Having seen a sample of the horrible things their fellow townspeople can do , choosing to stay out of the mess of humanity does n't seem like such a strange choice . </P> <P> When Boo finally does come out , he has a good reason : Bob Ewell is trying to murder the Finch children . No one sees what happens in the scuffle , but at the end of it , Ewell is dead and Boo carries an unconscious Jem to the Finch house . Finally faced with Boo , Scout does n't recognize him at first , but suddenly realizes who he is . Boo Radley is played by Robert Duvall in the film . </P> <H3> Judge John Taylor ( edit ) </H3> <P> Judge John Taylor is a white - haired old man with a reputation for running his court in an informal fashion and an enjoyment of singing and dipping tobacco . He is unimportant to the children until he presides over the Tom Robinson trial , in which he shows great distaste for the Ewells and great respect for Atticus . Because of the judge 's sympathies for Tom , Bob Ewell breaks into the judge 's house while the judge 's wife is at church . After the trial , Miss Maudie points out to the children that the judge had tried to help Tom by appointing Atticus to the case instead of Maxwell Green , the new , untried lawyer who usually received court - appointed cases . Judge Taylor knew that Atticus was the only man who would stand a chance at acquitting Tom , or at least would be able to keep the jury thinking for more than just a few minutes . By doing this , Judge Taylor was not giving in or supporting racism . He is portrayed in the film by Paul Fix . </P> <H3> Miss Maudie Atkinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Maude `` Maudie '' Atkinson lives across the street from the Finch family . She had known the Finches for many years , having been brought up on the Buford place , which was near the Finches ' ancestral home , Finch 's Landing . She is described as a woman of about 50 who enjoys baking and gardening ; her cakes are especially held in high regard . However , she is frequently harassed by devout `` Foot - Washing Baptists '' , who tell her that her enjoyment of gardening is a sin . The Foot - Washing Baptists also believe that women are a sin as well . Miss Maudie befriends Scout and Jem and tells them stories about Atticus as a boy . It is strongly implied that she and Atticus have a more than platonic relationship . Also , she is one of the few adults that Jem and Scout hold in high regard and respect . She does not act condescendingly towards them , even though they are young children . During the course of the novel , her house burns down ; however , she shows remarkable courage throughout this ( even saying that she wanted to burn it down herself to make more room for her flowers ) . She is not prejudiced , though she talks caustically to Miss Stephanie Crawford , unlike many of her Southern neighbors , and teaches Scout important lessons about racism and human nature . It is important to note that Miss Maudie fully explains that `` it is a sin to kill a mockingbird '' , whereas Atticus Finch initially brings up the subject but does n't go into depth . When Jem gets older , and does n't want to be bothered by Scout , Miss Maudie keeps her from getting angry . Maudie is played by Rosemary Murphy in the film . </P> <H3> Robert E. Lee `` Bob '' Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robert E. Lee `` Bob '' Ewell is the main antagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird . He has a daughter named Mayella and a younger son named Burris , as well as six other unnamed children . He is an alcoholic , poaching game to feed his family because he spends whatever money they legally gain via government `` relief checks '' on alcohol . It is implied , and evidence suggests , that he was the one who abused his daughter Mayella , not Tom Robinson ( the African American man accused of doing so ) . Although most everybody in town knows that the Ewells are a disgrace and not to be trusted , it is made clear that Tom Robinson was convicted because he is a Negro whose accuser is white . Upon hearing of Tom 's death , Bob is absolutely gleeful , gloating about his success . After being humiliated at the trial , however , he goes on a quest for revenge , becoming increasingly violent . He begins by spitting in Atticus ' face , followed by a failed attempt to break into the home of Judge Taylor , then finally menacing Helen , the poor widow of Tom Robinson . Ewell later attempts to murder Jem and Scout Finch with a knife to complete his revenge . Boo Radley saves Jem and Scout and it is believed that he kills Ewell with the knife . Heck Tate , the sheriff , puts in the official report that Bob Ewell fell on his own knife and died after lying under a tree for 45 minutes . Ewell is played by James Anderson in the film . </P> <H3> Mayella Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mayella Violet Ewell , 19 , is the oldest of the eight Ewell children . Before the trial , Mayella is noted for growing red geraniums outside her otherwise dirty home in order to bring some beauty into her life . Due to her family 's living situation , Mayella has no opportunity for human contact or love . She eventually gets so desperate that she attempts to seduce a black man , Tom Robinson , by saving up nickels to send her siblings to go get ice cream so that Mayella can be alone with Tom . Her father sees this through a window and in punishment he beats her . Ewell then finds the sheriff , Heck Tate , and tells him that his daughter has been raped and beaten by Tom . At the trial , Atticus points out that only the right side of Mayella 's face is injured , suggesting a left - handed assailant ; Tom 's left arm is mangled and useless , but Bob Ewell is left - handed . When Atticus asks her if she has any friends , she becomes confused because she does not know what a friend is . During her testimony she is confused by Atticus ' polite speech and thinks that his use of `` Miss Mayella '' is meant to mock her . She testifies against Tom Robinson . Mayella is played by Collin Wilcox in the film . </P> <H3> Tom Robinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Thomas `` Tom '' Robinson is an African - American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman , Mayella Ewell . Atticus is assigned to defend him , and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins . Tom 's left arm is crippled and useless , the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child . Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy , pointing out that the nature of Mayella 's facial injuries strongly suggest a left - handed assailant . Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family 's difficult life - a statement that shocks the all - white , male jury . Despite Atticus ' skilled defense , the jury 's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty . Atticus plans to appeal the verdict , but before he can do so , Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held . Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters . </P> <H3> Aunt Alexandra ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alexandra Hancock ( n\u00e9e Finch ) is Atticus ' and Jack 's sister , married to James `` Uncle Jimmy '' Hancock . She has a son named Henry and a very spoiled grandson named Francis . Around the middle of the book , Aunt Alexandra decides to leave her husband at Finch 's Landing , the Finch family homestead to come stay with the Finches . Aunt Alexandra does n't consider the black Calpurnia to be a very good motherly figure for Jem and Scout ; she disapproves of Scout being a tomboy and wants to make Scout into a southern belle ( encouraging her to act more ' lady like ' ) . This is the cause of many conflicts between Scout and Alexandra throughout the course of the novel . However , as the trial progresses , Scout comes to see how much her aunt cares for her father and what a strong woman she is . This is especially evidenced by a tea party when Scout is horrified by the racism displayed , and her aunt and Miss Maudie help her deal with her feelings . By the end of the book , it 's clear that Alexandra cares very much for her niece and nephew , though she and Scout will probably never really get along . </P> <H2> Minor characters ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Jack Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> John Hale `` Jack '' Finch is Atticus ' and Alexandra 's younger brother . ( He is about 40 , which is 10 years younger than Atticus . ) Jack smells like alcohol and something sweet , and is said that he and Alexandra have similar features . Jack is a childless doctor who can always make Scout and Jem laugh , and they adore him . He and Miss Maudie are close to the same age ; he frequently teases her with marriage proposals , which she always declines . Jack also has a pet cat named Rose Aylmer , who is mentioned during the Christmas visit . </P> <H3> Francis Hancock ( edit ) </H3> <P> Francis Hancock is the spoiled grandson of Aunt Alexandra . ( The son of her son , Henry Hancock . ) Every Christmas , Henry and his wife drop Francis at Finch 's Landing , which is the only time Scout and Jem see him . Francis lives in Mobile , Alabama , and is a bit of a tattle - tale . He gets along well with Jem , but often spars with Scout . One Christmas , Francis calls Atticus a `` nigger - lover , '' as well as insisting that he was ruining the family and the likes , which infuriates Scout and causes them to get into a fight . Francis lies about his role in it , telling Uncle Jack that Scout started it by calling him a `` whore lady '' , and Jack therefore punishes Scout . However , she explains the full story and charitably persuades her uncle not to punish Francis about it , but to let Atticus think they had been fighting about something else ( although Atticus later discovers the truth ) . </P> <H3> Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose is an elderly woman who lives near the Finches . She is hated by the children , who run by her house to avoid her . Scout describes Mrs. Dubose as `` plain hell . '' A virulent racist , she calls Atticus a `` nigger - lover '' to his children 's faces , and Jem flies into a rage and ravages Mrs. Dubose 's camellia bushes . As a punishment , Jem is required to read to Mrs. Dubose each day for a month . As Jem reads , she experiences a fit of drooling and twitching and does not seem to pay any attention to the words . When an alarm rings , Jem is allowed to leave for the day . She extends the punishment for one extra week and dies shortly after letting Jem go for the last time . Atticus informs him that Mrs. Dubose was terminally ill and had become addicted to morphine . By reading to her , Jem had distracted her so that she could break the addiction . In thanks , she leaves him a candy box with a camellia flower in it ; Jem burns the box in anger , but is later seen by Scout admiring the flower . Atticus tells Jem that Mrs. Dubose was the bravest person he ever knew , and she was trying to teach Jem the importance of bravery and true courage to endure anything when the situation is hopeless , as in her morphine addiction . </P> <H3> Mr. Heck Tate ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Heck Tate is a friend of Atticus and also the sheriff of Maycomb County . He believes in protecting the innocent although he does n't usually show it . At the end of the book , the Atticus and Heck argue over whether Jem or Boo Radley should be held responsible for the death of Bob Ewell . Heck eventually persuades Atticus to accept the theory that Ewell accidentally fell on his own knife , thus saving the harmless , reclusive Boo from the public exposure of a criminal trial . </P> <H3> Mr. Braxton Underwood ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Braxton Bragg Underwood is a news reporter and a friend of Atticus . He owns and also publishes The Maycomb Tribune . Being a racist , he disagrees with Atticus on principle . He also has a strong belief in justice , as exemplified when he defends Atticus from the Cunningham mob by having his double barrel shotgun loaded and ready to shoot them . He also demonstrates some humanity when he publishes a scathing editorial comparing the killing of Tom Robinson ( a cripple ) to `` the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children '' . </P> <H3> Mr. Horace Gilmer ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Horace Gilmer is a lawyer from Abbottsville , and is the prosecuting attorney in the Tom Robinson case . Mr. Gilmer is between the ages of forty and sixty . Mr. Gilmer has a slight cast with one eye , which he uses to his advantage in trial . Mr. Gilmer appeared to be racist in his harsh cross-examination of Tom Robinson , but it is hinted at that he is in fact going easy on Tom . He and Atticus are not rivals and talk to each other during recesses during the case . </P> <H3> Dr. Reynolds ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dr. Reynolds is the Maycomb doctor . He is well known to Scout and Jem . Scout says that he `` had brought Jem and me into the world , had led us through every childhood disease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the tree house , and he had never lost our friendship . Dr. Reynolds said that if we were boil - prone things would have been different ... '' . He inspects Jem 's broken arm and Scout 's minor bruises after the attack from Bob Ewell under the tree . </P> <H3> Dolphus Raymond ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dolphus Raymond is a white landowner who is jaded by the hypocrisy of the white society and prefers to live among black folks . In fact , he has children with a black woman . Dolphus pretends he is an alcoholic so that the people of Maycomb will have an excuse for his behavior , but in fact he only drinks Coca Cola out of a paper bag to try to hide it . When Dill and Scout discover that he is not a drunk , they are amazed . He shows Scout how sometimes you can pretend to be someone you 're not so people will be more understanding of you . </P> <H3> Link Deas ( edit ) </H3> <P> Link Deas owns cotton fields and a store in Maycomb who employs Tom and later Helen because she does not get accepted by any other employers in the county due to Tom Robinson 's legal troubles . He announces to the court ( in defense of Tom ) at one point in the trial that he had n't `` had a speck o ' trouble outta him '' in the eight years Tom had been working for him , and gets sent out by Judge John Taylor for doing so . When Bob Ewell starts threatening Helen after the trial , Mr. Deas fiercely defends her and threatens to have Mr. Ewell arrested if he keeps bothering her . He is on Tom Robinson 's side during the trial and remains loyal to the family afterward . </P> <H3> Miss Caroline Fisher ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Caroline Fisher is Scout 's first grade teacher and is new to Maycomb , Alabama and its ways . She attempts to teach the first grade class using a new system which she learned from taking certain college courses ( Jem mistakenly refers to it as the `` Dewey Decimal System '' , which is really how library books are organized . ) . She is upset by Scout 's advanced reading capabilities and believes that Scout is receiving lessons from Atticus . She feels as though Scout is trying to outsmart and mock her . In an effort to standardize the class , she forbids Scout from reading with her father . Atticus asks Scout to step into Miss Caroline 's skin . However , he continues to allow Scout to read with him at night so long as she continues to go to school . Miss Caroline has good intentions but proves quite incompetent as a teacher . When Scout tells Miss Fisher that she shamed a student ( Walter Cunningham , Jr . ) by giving him lunch money , she raps Scout 's palms with a ruler ( a punishment unheard of in Maycomb ) . She is also very sensitive and gets emotionally hurt quite easily , as seen when she cries after Burris Ewell yells at her , `` Report and be damned to ye ! Ai n't no snot - nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin ' ! You ai n't makin ' me go nowhere , missus . You just remember that , you ai n't makin ' me go nowhere ! '' After the Burris Ewell incident , Miss Caroline is seldom seen and soon forgotten . </P> <H3> Reverend Sykes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reverend Sykes is the reverend of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb County , where most if not all of the African - American characters go to church . Reverend Sykes forces the congregation to donate 10 dollars for Tom Robinson 's family since at the time , Tom 's wife , Helen , was having trouble finding work . During the trial , when the courtroom was too packed for the children to find seats , Reverend Sykes lets the kids sit with him up in the colored balcony and even saves their seats for them . </P> <H3> Miss Stephanie Crawford ( edit ) </H3> <P> Stephanie Crawford is the neighborhood gossip who claimed that she saw Boo Radley from her bedroom standing outside of her cleaned window one night . Crawford is one of the first on the scene after a loud gunshot is heard behind the Radley house . Because she is the neighborhood gossip , it is unwise to think of anything that she says as true , because most of the time it is not true at all . She is a friend of Alexandra Hancock . She lets Miss Maudie live with her when Miss Maudie 's house burns down , supposedly in order to steal Miss Maudie 's Lane cake recipe . She is thrilled to pass on gossip to the kids about Boo Radley . She claimed to have witnessed Bob Ewell 's threatening Atticus at the Post Office corner as she was returning from the local Jitney Jungle grocery store . </P> <P> In the film , she takes the place of Rachel Haverford and is now Dill 's aunt . </P> <H3> Miss Rachel Haverford ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Rachel Haverford is Dill 's aunt and the Finches ' next door neighbor . She drank neat whiskey heavily after seeing a rattlesnake coiled in her closet , on her washing , when she hung her negligee up . Even though she can be very hard to deal with , she truly does love her nephew . Her family name , in the legends of Maycomb County , is synonymous with jackass . She is also a Southern Belle . </P> <P> In the film , she is not a character and Miss Stephanie takes her place as Dill 's aunt . </P> <H3> Helen Robinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Helen Robinson is the wife of Tom Robinson . She is spoken about a few times . She has three children . Employed by Link Deas following the death of her husband , she is repeatedly harassed by Bob Ewell when traveling to work . Upon learning of this , Deas threatens Ewell , forcing him to stop . She is an example of how one person 's actions can have an effect on a lot of people and she elucidates the hardships that surround the Tom Robinson case . </P> <H3> Nathan Radley ( edit ) </H3> <P> Nathan Radley is the brother of Arthur `` Boo '' Radley and another difficult character to understand in To Kill a Mockingbird . When the children try to catch a view of `` Boo '' late one night through a window , he shoots over their heads with a shotgun ( albeit thinking he was aiming at a black person ) . Nathan also cements up the knothole in which Arthur leaves little gifts for the children . On the other hand , he helps Miss Maudie by saving some of her belongings when her house is on fire . He is more present than his brother , but equally mysterious . </P> <H3> Jessie ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jessie is Mrs. Dubose 's black nurse . She is the woman who shoos the children out when Mrs. Dubose has her fits , and she seems to care enormously for Mrs. Dubose . When Jem is forced to stay reading to Mrs. Dubose , Jessie kindly leads Jem and Scout to the door when Mrs. Dubose 's alarm goes off . The rumors about Mrs. Dubose concealing a gun about her person involves Jessie ; the book says `` and even if Mrs. Dubose missed , her girl Jessie would n't '' . </P> <H3> Burris Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Burris Ewell is a son of Bob Ewell and a younger sibling of Mayella Ewell as well as the first antagonist of the novel . Burris is described as being chiefly antagonistic of Little Chuck Little and his teacher Miss Caroline Fisher . He comes to the first day of school , but departs just as everyone else in his family does . Burris is also poor . He has live lice in his hair . Burris also scared his teacher Caroline Fisher . He behaves rudely when she tells him to go home , wash his hair , and come back clean the next day . He refuses , and a student explains to Miss Caroline that Ewell children do n't attend school . All they do is show up for the first day , get marked down on the register , and then they miss the entire school year until the first day of the next year . His famous quote was , `` Report and be damned to ye ! Ai n't no snot - nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin ' ! You ai n't makin ' me go nowhere , missus . You just remember that , you ai n't makin ' me go nowhere ! '' As of Scout 's first year of school ( the first grade ) , Burris has repeated the first grade three times . Burris is also like his father and is very belligerent . </P> <H3> Lula ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lula is an African - American woman with a dislike for white people . She does n't like the idea of Calpurnia bringing Atticus Finch 's children , Jem and Scout , with her to church and tells her so but is overruled by the other congregants . According to James Zeebo , Calpurnia 's son , Lula 's said to be , `` a troublemaker from way back , with fancy ideas and haughty ways . '' She 's threatened with being `` churched '' ( subjected to church discipline ) by Reverend Sykes . </P> <H3> Mrs. Grace Merriweather ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Grace Merriweather is the producer of the play in which Scout plays as a ham . She tells Everett that `` the ladies of the South Maycomb Alabama Methodist Episcopal Church are behind him one hundred percent . '' She is mostly known for her devotion to the church and is widely held as the most devout lady in Maycomb ; however , like many of her peers , she is very hypocritical and loves to gossip with all the other women . </P> <H3> Walter Cunningham , Jr. ( edit ) </H3> <P> Walter Cunningham , Jr. is a child who is almost as old as Jem but is in Scout 's class . He lives on a farm . He is too poor to even pay off a 25 - cent debt because the Great Depression hit his poor family hard . He does n't take money because his family ca n't pay people back in cash . His father paid Atticus for his service for something a while back with some goods . Walter is invited over to the Finches ' house once , after engaging in a fight with Scout , where he covers up all of his dinner with molasses , much to Scout 's vocal dismay . This teaches Scout a lesson in humility and compassion . </P> <H3> Walter Cunningham , Sr. ( edit ) </H3> <P> Walter Cunningham , Sr. is Walter Cunningham Jr. 's father . He appears only twice , once at the beginning of the story when he has to pay off the debt to Atticus ( Walter Cunningham Sr. was his client ) by giving him firewood , vegetables and other supplies . He also leads the mob that comes to lynch Tom Robinson the night before the trial . Only when Scout talks to him about his son and how much he owes to Atticus does he reconsider and call off the mob . Scout innocently shames him because Scout reminds him of all the things that Atticus has done for him and for Maycomb County . After the verdict is given in the trial , Atticus tells Jem that one of the Cunninghams had changed his thoughts about Tom and pleaded that Tom was not guilty to the jury . </P> <H3> Little Chuck Little ( edit ) </H3> <P> Little Chuck Little is a student in Scout 's first - grade class who has the mindset of an adult . His real name is Charles . He is depicted as chiefly antagonistic of Burris Ewell . He is presented in the novel when Miss Caroline is frightened by Burris ' lice . He warned Miss Caroline that if Burris was n't released from class , he might try something that would put their classmates at risk . When Burris starts advancing on Little Chuck after his warning / veiled insult , Little Chuck 's hand moved to his pocket ( implying that he was going to pull out a knife ) while saying , `` Watch your step , Burris . I 'd soon 's kill you as look at you . Now go home . '' Scared by Little Chuck 's bravery and his implied knife , Burris retreats . From this we see , through the narrative view of Scout , his gentlemanly attitude and how it calms Miss Caroline down . Little Chuck may be even more intelligent than originally meets the eye , as he easily could have been bluffing about the aforementioned implied knife to scare Burris into retreating . </P> <H3> Mr. Dick Avery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Dick Avery is an overweight neighbor who tells Jem and Scout that dramatic changes in the weather are caused by disobedient and misbehaving children . After it snows , they build a snowman that resembles him . Mr. Avery can also be seen in the story pushing a mattress out of a window when Miss Maudie 's house catches fire .

One night , the siblings prepare puttanesca for Olaf 's theatre troupe only for him to demand roast beef upon arriving home .

After returning to the house , the siblings decipher Josephine 's suicide note and discover she is still alive moments before a hurricane sends the house teetering over the cliff . Escaping with a photograph of their parents standing in front of a lumber mill , the siblings find Josephine at a nearby cave , only to be confronted by Olaf , who abandons Josephine to be eaten alive by the leeches that inhabit Lake Lachrymose .

The school 's only redeeming qualities are its friendly librarian , Olivia Caliban , and the surviving Quagmire triplets , Duncan and Isadora . During a lunch break , Klaus and Isadora discover that they are holding two halves of the same spyglass . The newfound friends quickly realize that they must track down a book on secret organizations to find the answers they seek -- a book Jacquelyn sent Larry to give them , but which he carelessly misplaced . Meanwhile , Count Olaf and his troupe lurk around the grounds of the school , unable to enter the front doors due to an advanced computer system programmed by Nero to detect Olaf 's presence . However , with Carmelita 's help , Olaf finally gains entry and locks Larry in the cafeteria 's walk - in refrigerator .

Due to their slumping grades , Nero threatens to expel the Baudelaires if they fail a comprehensive exam to be given in front of the entire school , but because they must still exercise under Olaf 's program , they know they will likely fail . The Quagmires offer to help , and that night take their place during exercises ; however , their identity is discovered , and while hiding in the library , they find the copy of the book on secret organizations and read up on the purpose of the spyglass before they are caught by the Hook - Handed Man . The next day , with Mr. Poe in attendance , the Baudelaires readily pass the exam , and through it reveal Olaf 's identity . Olaf and his gang then escape with the Quagmires , who try to shout the initials `` V.F.D. '' from the backseat of Olaf 's car .

While being introduced to the Squalors , they find Olaf has already arrived , posing as a foreign auctioneer named Gunther . The Baudelaires theorize that Olaf is trying to kill Jerome so that he can marry Esm\u00e9 and become their legal guardian again . They search the penthouse for the Quagmires to no avail , but Klaus becomes suspicious of an extra elevator that only seems to serve the penthouse . Meanwhile , Olivia tries to convince Mr. Poe about Olaf 's scheme , which leads Jacquelyn to contact Jacques , who enlists her into their society . Esm\u00e9 suggests they go out for lunch at a fashionable salmon - themed restaurant Cafe Salmonella , where Larry works to prolong their visit , giving Jacques and Olivia time to search the Squalor 's building for the Quagmires . When the Baudelaires manage to sneak away and examine the second elevator , they learn that it is merely an empty shaft .

They try to warn Esm\u00e9 of Olaf 's scheme , but learn too late that she is in cahoots with him and that they are planning to smuggle the Quagmires out of the city . Esm\u00e9 pushes them down the elevator shaft , where they are caught in a net midway down . Sunny helps them to escape safely , and afterwards they find a secret passage that leads to the ashen ruins of their home . At the auction in Veblen Hall , the Baudelaires start a bidding war on a box labeled `` V.F.D. '' , which they believe contains the Quagmires . Though they win the item , they find the box contains only doilies . In the aftermath , Olaf and his troupe escape with the Quagmires , who are hidden inside a red herring statue . The Baudelaires ask Jerome to help track down Olaf , but he is far too timid to do so , and gives up his guardianship of them . Mr. Poe tells the children that a village with the initials `` V.F.D.

While in jail , the children instruct Hector to prepare his hot - air mobile home to help them escape . While Violet creates a battering ram to weaken the jail wall , Klaus deduces from their clues that the Quagmires are hidden inside a crow fountain in the village square . Larry and Jacquelyn arrive on the scene to distract the villagers long enough for the children to escape via a fire truck and follow Hector . The Baudelaires cover for the Quagmires as they use the truck 's ladder to climb aboard the mobile home . As they do so , Olaf , Esm\u00e9 , and the villagers arrive , and Esm\u00e9 begins damaging Hector 's home with a harpoon gun . Realizing their danger , the Baudelaires tell Hector to escape with the Quagmires . In thanks , the Quagmires try to throw their friends their notes about the secrets of V.F.D. , but Esm\u00e9 shoots them with a harpoon , scattering the pages and harming a crow .

He welcomes their help , but forbids them to read material in storage . While Hal shows them the ropes , a film reel labeled `` Snicket '' arrives and catches the children 's attention . Meanwhile , believing the Sugar Bowl to be in the hospital , Olaf and his troupe infiltrate the building . Desperate for answers , the children are forced to steal Hal 's keys to access the library , where they find the film . It contains a debriefing of Jacques by a V.F.D. volunteer , with Jacques informing the interviewer that someone has survived a fire , which may or may not be the one that killed the Baudelaire 's parents . However , before they can watch any further , they are interrupted by Esm\u00e9 ; as they try to escape , the library is ruined .

Esm\u00e9 promises to call off the scheme if Klaus can give her what he stole from the Library of Records , and he does so -- only , it 's not the Sugar Bowl that she has been searching for . Olaf , however , is interested in the Snicket film , and dashes off to watch it to learn its secret . Furious at its revelations , he burns the film , which also starts a fire in the hospital . The Baudelaires successfully evacuate the hospital and realize that their only chance to escape safely is in the trunk of Olaf 's car . Hal is left depressed over the loss of the Library of Records .

Lulu , who is really Olivia in disguise , tells them to wait for the answer in the morning . The Baudelaires overhear this , and hoping to speak to Lulu as well , assume the identities of circus freaks , with Violet and Klaus as a two - headed person and Sunny as a wolf child . After calling V.F.D. , Olivia is able to tell Olaf the next day that one of the Baudelaire parents did indeed survive the fire . Olaf then presents a freak show that proves disastrous , so he sets off to find a pack of roaming lions to help attract a larger crowd . This gives an opportunity for the children to sneak into Lulu 's tent , where they discover films , books , and disguises belonging to the Volunteer Fire Department -- the secret organization their parents and guardians belonged to .

While Olivia admits she had to lie to Olaf about one of the children 's parents surviving the fire , Jacques had asserted that there was a survivor , and they should head to the V.F.D. headquarters in the Mortmain Mountains to find them . Meanwhile , Olaf plans to throw one of the freaks into a pit filled with the hungry lions he has corralled , while Esm\u00e9 connives to have Lulu killed . The next day , Olaf selects Violet and Klaus for the pit . When Olivia is told to push the children to the lions , she instead pushes them to safety , and is sent tumbling into the pit by Olaf for her troubles . As the children try to collect the V.F.D. materials from Lulu 's tent , Olaf arrives and forces them to burn the tent down . Then , after placing Violet and Klaus in a towed caravan and taking Sunny in his car , Olaf has the other freaks cut the towing rope on a steep mountain path .

Barry Sonnenfeld will direct the episodes for The Penultimate Peril . Liza Johnson and Jonathan Teplitzky will also direct episodes in the season . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> <P> The thirteen A Series of Unfortunate Events novels , written by Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket from 1999 to 2006 , achieved success in young adult fiction around the same time as the Harry Potter novels . As such , the Snicket books had been optioned to be filmed before they were published . This led to the development of a 2004 feature film , Lemony Snicket 's A Series of Unfortunate Events , which covered the narratives of the first three novels in the series . Barry Sonnenfeld , who has expressed his love for the series , was originally slated to direct the feature film , and had hired Handler to write the screenplay . About 10 months into production , shortly after the casting of Jim Carrey as Olaf , there was a `` big crisis '' , according to Handler , which caused producer Scott Rudin to walk away and Sonnenfeld left the production under unclear terms . With the film 's completion in flux , its producing studios Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks fired Handler . While the film was eventually completed and released , sequels which would adapt the other novels in the series became unlikely due to `` corporate shakeups '' within DreamWorks , according to Handler , and the child actors that portrayed the Baudelaire children grew too old to star in a sequel . </P> <P> In November 2014 , Netflix , in association with Paramount Television , announced its plans to adapt the novels into an original television series , with the author of the series , Daniel Handler , serving as executive producer . </P> <P> In September 2015 , it was announced that Barry Sonnenfeld and Mark Hudis had agreed to helm the series . Hudis would serve as showrunner , Sonnenfeld as director , and both as executive producers , with Handler writing some of the scripts along with working with the series ' writing team . However , in January 2016 , Netflix announced that Hudis had left the project , with a replacement showrunner not named at the time . </P> <P> The first season consists of eight episodes , with two episodes adapting each of the first four books of the series . Handler considered this more in line with how he had written the books in the manner of a serialized melodrama , citing The Perils of Pauline as one of his influences in writing the book series . In January 2017 , Handler revealed that he was writing the series ' second season , to consist of ten episodes adapting the fifth through ninth books of the series . A third season would adapt the remaining novels of the series , which Handler hoped `` to get the go - ahead to do '' since `` given how quickly young actors age and change , we 're trying to film everything as quickly as possible . '' In March 2017 , Netflix revealed the series had been renewed for a second season by releasing a video on their social media pointing to a viral marketing website , where a letter written by Snicket revealed the decision . A month later , the series was `` quietly '' renewed for a third season , which Harris confirmed would be the final one for the series . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> Neil Patrick Harris portrays Count Olaf in the series and serves as a producer . <P> On December 3 , 2015 , an open casting call was announced for the roles of Violet and Klaus Baudelaire . In January 2016 , Netflix announced that Neil Patrick Harris had been cast as Count Olaf and Malina Weissman and Louis Hynes were cast as Violet and Klaus . Handler had first considered Harris for the role of Olaf after seeing him perform the opening number `` It 's Not Just for Gays Anymore '' , at the 65th Tony Awards in 2011 , noting `` I just immediately saw someone who could pull off a million things at once '' as was necessary for the character of Olaf , who utilizes various disguises and accents in his quest to steal the Baudelaire fortune . </P> <P> In March 2016 , K. Todd Freeman was cast as Mr. Poe , followed shortly after by the casting of Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket , and Aasif Mandvi as Uncle Monty . In September 2016 , it was revealed that Dylan Kingwell and Avi Lake were cast as the Quagmire siblings , Duncan and Isadora , respectively . In November 2016 , Handler revealed Catherine O'Hara , Don Johnson , and Alfre Woodard had been cast as Dr. Georgina Orwell , Sir , and Aunt Josephine , respectively ; O'Hara had previously portrayed Justice Strauss in the 2004 film adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events . It was also revealed that Presley Smith would play Sunny Baudelaire , whose quasi-nonsensical lines are voiced by Tara Strong , and Rhys Darby would play Charles , Sir 's partner . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Production began in May 2016 in Vancouver , British Columbia , and in August 2016 several cast members expressed through social media that filming had finished . Filming for the second season began in April 2017 . The third season began filming on January 5 , 2018 . </P> <P> One aspect of the series of books that the production team wanted to be captured in the series was the notion of a lack of specific time period or geography for the settings ; Handler stated that he wrote enough for establishing set pieces , but purposely left more specific details vague `` in order for young readers to fill in the blanks themselves . '' Sonnenfeld wanted to capture that same sense of ambiguous time and place , and he and his team worked to try to define a set of subjective rules of what elements could be included . Sonnenfeld brought on Bo Welch , production designer for Edward Scissorhands , which Handler considered to capture the same sense of a `` familiar but completely imaginary '' suburban setting he had in mind for his books . While the production team used computer - generated imagery where needed , they attempted to avoid this use where possible , such as by using large painted backdrops , by key scenic artist John E. Wilcox , rather than employing green screen filming . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> <P> In April 2016 , Nick Urata was initially reported to be composing music for the series . Once the first season was released , it was revealed that Urata collaborated with Daniel Handler to compose the main title theme , `` Look Away '' , as well as various original songs that appear throughout the series , with Handler contributing the lyrics . The first season 's original score was composed by James Newton Howard , with his frequent collaborators Sven Faulconer and Chris Bacon filling in to score certain episodes . In the second season , Jim Dooley joined the production as composer and subsequently wrote the music for all ten episodes . </P> <P> `` Look Away '' , the theme song for the opening titles of the series , is performed by Neil Patrick Harris . In keeping with the tone of the book series , the song warns the viewer against continuing to watch the unpleasant story any further . The lyrics of one verse of the song change for each pair of episodes , comprising a brief synopsis of those episodes ' premise . </P> <H3> Visual effects ( edit ) </H3> <P> Zoic Studios created visual effects for the series , including the effects for many of Sunny Baudelaire 's actions . Tippett Studio also did work on the series , including the effects for the destruction of Josephine 's house , landscape shots of Lake Lachrymose and some of the more movement heavy Sunny Baudelaire shots . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> All eight episodes of the first season of A Series of Unfortunate Events were released worldwide on Netflix on January 13 , 2017 , in Ultra HD 4K . The second season was released on March 30 , 2018 . </P> <H3> Marketing ( edit ) </H3> <P> On July 5 , 2015 a video titled `` An Unfortunate Teaser '' was uploaded to YouTube by a user named `` Eleanora Poe '' . Netflix quickly released a statement saying `` This was not released from Netflix . '' Media outlets were almost unanimous in agreement that the trailer was fan - made . However , Caitlin Petrakovitz of CNET argued that the trailer may be real and that Netflix 's carefully worded denial was a marketing campaign , noting the user name `` Eleanora Poe '' being the same as a character from the series , and that a vinyl record seen in the trailer was of The Gothic Archies , a band who provided the theme music for the audio books of A Series of Unfortunate Events . The trailer was later revealed to be a spec promo , similar to a spec script , by an independent commercial director , whom Netflix contracted to make a title sequence for the series after the video 's popularity , though they did not go ahead with the concept . </P> <P> In October 2016 , Netflix released the first teaser trailer for A Series of Unfortunate Events , where Warburton narrates the events of the series as Lemony Snicket . A trailer , featuring footage from the series and Neil Patrick Harris 's character , Count Olaf , was released by Netflix in November 2016 , followed shortly by the first full trailer . The second trailer was released in December 2016 , followed by a `` holiday - themed '' trailer from Count Olaf leading fans to a viral marketing website for the fictional Valorous Farms Dairy , which featured four holiday e-cards for download . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Audience viewership ( edit ) </H3> <P> As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series , Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the first season based on people using software on their devices that measure television viewing by detecting a program 's sound . According to Symphony , 3.755 million viewers age 18 - 49 were watching an episode of A Series of Unfortunate Events over the average minute in its first weekend of release . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> Season 1 ( edit ) <P> The first season of A Series of Unfortunate Events received critical acclaim . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the season an approval rating of 94 % based on 62 reviews , with an average rating of 8.1 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Enjoyably dark , A Series of Unfortunate Events matches the source material 's narrative as well as its tone , leaving viewers with a wonderfully weird , dry , gothic comedy . '' On Metacritic the season has a score of 81 out of 100 , based on 23 critics , indicating `` universal acclaim '' . </P> <P> Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the season a B and praised it for treating `` mature themes like grief , loss , and disappointment with sardonic honesty . '' Adams compared the program positively to the Adam West Batman series , calling it `` kids stuff with adult sophistication , driven by two - part stories , outrageous visuals , and the scenery - chewing of big - name guest stars '' . Ben Travers of Indiewire gave the series an A - , saying that it `` proves as inspirational and endearing as it claims to be forlorn and heartbreaking '' . Brian Lowry of CNN praised the showrunners for `` infusing the show with a lemony - fresh feel , conjuring a series similar to the fantastical tone of Pushing Daisies '' . Lowry wrote that `` the show proves a good deal of fun '' and that `` Harris dives into his over-the - top character with considerable gusto . '' He also argued that the series improved upon the 2004 film . </P> <P> Several critics praised the television series as a better adaptation of the books than the 2004 feature film , which starred Jim Carrey as Count Olaf . Kelly Lawler of USA Today felt the television format gave the stories more room to develop , the addition of Warburton as the fourth wall - breaking Snicket helped to convey some of the wordplay humor used in the books , and Harris 's portrayal of Olaf was `` much more dynamic , and creepier '' than Carrey 's version . The Verge 's Chaim Gartenburg said that the show follows the books much more faithfully than the film , and `` nails down the tone that made the stories so special '' . Los Angeles Times writer Robert Lloyd felt that the backgrounds of Sonnenfeld and Welch made them `` the right people for this job , set in a milieu that is hard to fix in time , except to say it is not now '' , in capturing the tones of the book compared to the feature film . </P> <P> Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com , on the other hand , gave the series a negative review , calling it `` an unfunny parody of sadness '' that is `` never as clever as it wants to be '' and would only appeal to fans of the books . Caroline Framke of Vox Media praised the series for its unique and weird visuals , but found the show 's tone , pacing and performances to be haphazard and considered the show to be `` literally , a series of unfortunate events '' . </P> Season 2 ( edit ) <P> As with the first season , the second season of A Series of Unfortunate Events received critical acclaim . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the second season an approval rating of 100 % based on 13 reviews , with an average rating of 7.8 / 10 . Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent praised the show as one that `` essentially deals with thoughtful , intelligent young people battling to speak up against an illogical world . '' While observing that the `` show may revel in the miserable '' , she opined `` that the purpose of its own morbidity is to offer the assurance that hope lives in even the darkest of places . '' Loughrey also credited the show 's expanded storyline for the Baudelaires ' adult allies for `` plumping up '' the episodes ' narrative arcs and deepening the show 's emotional impact . </P> <P> Tristram Fane Saunders of The Telegraph awarded the second season four out of five stars . He described the show as a `` gothic treat ( that ) also offers a wicked line in absurdist humour , and the most gorgeously toybox - like set designs you 'll find anywhere outside a Wes Anderson film . '' Radio Times reviewer Huw Fullerton praised the series for its faithfulness to the original novels . While praising the improved CGI used to make Presley Smith 's character Sunny Baudelaire react better to situations , he criticized the addition of supporting `` good '' characters such as Nathan Fillion 's Jacques Snicket and Sara Canning 's Jacquelyn for `` undercutting the bleakness and loneliness that characterized the novels . '' </P> <P> Rohan Naahar of the Hindustan Times described A Series of Unfortunate Events as `` one of the most lavish originals in Netflix 's bottomless catalogue , created by fans , for fans . '' He also praised Neil Patrick Harris ' performance as Count Olaf . The Den of Geek reviewer Michael Ahr praised tortoise - shell ' amphibiophones ' and stone marimbas score for giving the television series its primal sound . IGN reviewer Jonathon Dornbush criticized the second season 's formulaic plot structure and lack of the insightful observations compared to the first season . He also praised several of the second season 's episodes particularly `` The Ersatz Elevator '' , `` The Hostile Hospital '' , and `` The Carnivorous Carnival '' for smartly twisting the story formula and deepening the novel series ' mythology . Dornbush also praised the performance of guest stars such as Lucy Punch and Patrick Warburton and awarded the second season 7.2 stars . </P> <H2> Awards and nominations ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Category </Th> <Th> Nominee </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Ref </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Leo Awards </Td> <Td> Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series </Td> <Td> Luis Alejandro Guevara , Bob Habros , Cale Jacox , Ron Simonson , Jeffrey De Guzman </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Make - Up in a Dramatic Series </Td> <Td> Rita Ciccozzi , Krista Seller , Tanya Hudson , Gitte Axen </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Hairstyling in a Dramatic Series </Td> <Td> Julie Mchaffie , Dianne Holme , Jenine Lehfeldt </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Guest Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series </Td> <Td> Sara Canning </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Saturn Awards </Td> <Td> Best New Media Television Series </Td> <Td> A Series of Unfortunate Events </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Creative Arts Emmy Awards </Td> <Td> Outstanding Music Composition for a Series </Td> <Td> James Newton Howard </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Gold Derby TV Awards </Td> <Td> Comedy Actor </Td> <Td> Neil Patrick Harris </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hollywood Music in Media Awards </Td> <Td> Main Title Theme -- TV Show / Limited Series </Td> <Td> Nick Urata and Daniel Handler </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Peabody Awards </Td> <Td> Children 's & Youth Programming </Td> <Td> A Series of Unfortunate Events </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2018 </Td> <Td> Satellite Awards </Td> <Td> Best Actor in a Series - Comedy or Musical </Td> <Td> Neil Patrick Harris </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Netflix and critics name the first two episodes as `` The Bad Beginning '' , following the title of the book , while the episode itself displays the name of `` A Bad Beginning '' after the opening credits . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Netflix names the episodes of the second season as Part 1 and Part 2 , while the episodes themselves display the names as Part One and Part Two after the opening credits , following the format of the first season . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Netflix names the ninth and tenth episodes as `` Carnivorous Carnival '' , while the episodes themselves display the name of `` The Carnivorous Carnival '' after the opening credits , following the title of the book . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Wollaston , Sam ( January 13 , 2017 ) . `` Lemony Snicket 's A Series of Unfortunate Events review -- fabulous steampunk fun '' -- via The Guardian . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` A Series of Unfortunate Events ' : Barry Sonnenfeld Was Booted Off the Movie , and Now He 's Saved the Franchise '' .

The line of succession is set by the United States Constitution and the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 as subsequently amended to include newly created cabinet offices . The succession follows the order of Vice President , Speaker of the House of Representatives , President pro tempore of the Senate , and then the heads of federal executive departments who form the Cabinet of the United States . The Cabinet currently has fifteen members , beginning with the Secretary of State , and followed by the rest in the order of their positions ' creation . Those heads of department who are ineligible to act as President are also ineligible to succeed the President by succession , for example most commonly if they are not a natural - born U.S. citizen . </P> <P> Several constitutional law experts have raised questions as to the constitutionality of the provisions that the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate succeed to the presidency , and in 2003 the Continuity of Government Commission raised a number of other issues with the current line of succession . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Current order </Li> <Li> 2 Eligibility <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Eligibility requirements </Li> <Li> 2.2 Acting officers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Motivation for changes to the succession in 1945 </Li> <Li> 4 Constitutional provisions </Li> <Li> 5 Acting President and President </Li> <Li> 6 History of succession law set by Congress <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Presidential Succession Act 1792 </Li> <Li> 6.2 Presidential Succession Act 1886 </Li> <Li> 6.3 Presidential Succession Act 1947 </Li> <Li> 6.4 Postmaster General removed 1971 </Li> <Li> 6.5 Secretary of Homeland Security added 2006 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Successions beyond Vice President </Li> <Li> 8 Constitutional concerns </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External Links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Current order ( edit ) </H2> <P> The current presidential order of succession is as follows : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Key </Th> <Td> Eligible Democrat ( D ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Eligible Republican ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Eligible Independent ( I ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Eligible unknown </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Not eligible </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Office </Th> <Th> Current officer </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> Vice President </Td> <Td> Mike Pence ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> Speaker of the House of Representatives </Td> <Td> Paul Ryan ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> President pro tempore of the Senate </Td> <Td> Orrin Hatch ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> Secretary of State </Td> <Td> Rex Tillerson ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 5 </Th> <Td> Secretary of the Treasury </Td> <Td> Steven Mnuchin ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 6 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Defense </Td> <Td> James Mattis ( I ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 7 </Th> <Td> Attorney General </Td> <Td> Jeff Sessions ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 8 </Th> <Td> Secretary of the Interior </Td> <Td> Ryan Zinke ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 9 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Agriculture </Td> <Td> Sonny Perdue ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 10 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Commerce </Td> <Td> Wilbur Ross ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 11 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Labor </Td> <Td> Alex Acosta ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 12 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Health and Human Services </Td> <Td> Eric Hargan ( R ) Acting </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 13 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Housing and Urban Development </Td> <Td> Ben Carson ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> -- </Th> <Td> Secretary of Transportation </Td> <Td> Elaine Chao ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 14 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Energy </Td> <Td> Rick Perry ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 15 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Education </Td> <Td> Betsy DeVos ( R ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 16 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Veterans Affairs </Td> <Td> David Shulkin ( I ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 17 </Th> <Td> Secretary of Homeland Security </Td> <Td> Elaine Duke ( I ) Acting </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : This listing assumes that acting officers whose prior appointment required Senate confirmation are eligible for the line of succession .

These eligibility requirements are specified both in the U.S. Constitution , Article II , Section 1 , Clause 5 , and in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 ( 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 19 ( e ) ) . </P> <H3> Acting officers ( edit ) </H3> <P> Acting officers may be eligible . In 2009 , the Continuity of Government Commission , a private non-partisan think tank , reported , </P> <P> The language in the current Presidential Succession Act is less clear than that of the 1886 Act with respect to Senate confirmation . The 1886 Act refers to `` such officers as shall have been appointed by the advice and consent of the Senate to the office therein named ... '' The current act merely refers to `` officers appointed , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . '' Read literally , this means that the current act allows for acting secretaries to be in the line of succession as long as they are confirmed by the Senate for a post ( even for example , the second or third in command within a department ) . It is common for a second in command to become acting secretary when the secretary leaves office . Though there is some dispute over this provision , the language clearly permits acting secretaries to be placed in the line of succession . ( We have spoken to acting secretaries who told us they had been placed in the line of succession . ) </P> <H2> Motivation for changes to the succession in 1945 ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two months after succeeding Franklin D. Roosevelt , President Harry S. Truman proposed that the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate be granted priority in the line of succession over the Cabinet so as to ensure the President would not be able to appoint his successor to the Presidency . </P> <P> The Secretary of State and the other Cabinet officials are appointed by the President , while the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate are elected officials . The Speaker is chosen by the U.S. House of Representatives , and every Speaker has been a member of that body for the duration of their term as Speaker , though this is not technically a requirement ; the President pro tempore is chosen by the U.S. Senate and customarily the Senator of the majority party with the longest record of continuous service fills this position . The Congress approved this change and inserted the Speaker and President pro tempore in line , ahead of the members of the Cabinet in the order in which their positions were established . </P> <P> In his speech supporting the changes , Truman noted that the House of Representatives is more likely to be in political agreement with the President and Vice President than the Senate . The succession of a Republican to a Democratic Presidency would further complicate an already unstable political situation . However , when the changes to the succession were signed into law , they placed Republican House Speaker Joseph W. Martin first in the line of succession after the Vice President . </P> <P> Some of Truman 's critics said that his ordering of the Speaker before the President pro tempore was motivated by his dislike of the then - current holder of the latter rank , Senator Kenneth McKellar . Further motivation may have been provided by Truman 's preference for House Speaker Sam Rayburn to be next in the line of succession , rather than Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius , Jr . </P> <H2> Constitutional provisions ( edit ) </H2> <P> The line of succession is mentioned in three places in the Constitution : </P> <Ul> <Li> Article II , Section 1 , Clause 6 makes the Vice President first in the line of succession and allows the Congress to provide by law for cases in which neither the President nor Vice President can serve . The current such law governing succession is the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 ( 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 19 ) . </Li> <Li> Section 3 of the 20th Amendment provides that if the President - elect dies before his term begins , the Vice President - elect becomes President on Inauguration Day and serves for the full term to which the President - elect was elected . The section also provides that if , on Inauguration Day , a president has not been chosen or the President - elect does not qualify for the presidency , the Vice President - elect acts as president until a president is chosen or the President - elect qualifies . Finally , Section 3 allows the Congress to provide by law for cases in which neither a President - elect nor a Vice President - elect is eligible or available to serve . </Li> <Li> The 25th Amendment , ratified in 1967 , clarified Article II , Section 1 : that the Vice President is the direct successor of the President . He or she becomes President if the President dies , resigns or is removed from office . The amendment also provides for the situation where the President is temporarily disabled , such as if the President has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally unfit . The amendment also provides for Vice Presidential succession , by requiring Vice Presidential vacancies to be filled by the President and confirmed by both houses of the Congress . Previously , whenever a Vice President had succeeded to the Presidency or had otherwise left the office empty ( through death , resignation , or removal from office ) , the Vice Presidency remained vacant until the next Presidential and Vice Presidential terms began . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Acting President and President ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Acting President of the United States New President Lyndon Johnson was sworn in aboard Air Force One , following the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 . <P> Article II , Section 1 of the United States Constitution provides that : </P> <P> In case of the removal of the President from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the Vice President ... until the disability be removed , or a President elected . </P> <P> This originally left open the question whether `` the same '' refers to `` the said office '' or only `` the powers and duties of the said office . '' Some historians , including Edward Corwin and John D. Feerick , have argued that the framers ' intention was that the Vice President would remain Vice President while executing the powers and duties of the Presidency ; however , there is also much evidence to the contrary , the most compelling of which is Article I , section 3 , of the Constitution itself , the relevant text of which reads : </P> <P> The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate , but shall have no vote , unless they be equally divided . The Senate shall chuse ( sic ) their other officers , and also a President pro tempore , in the absence of the Vice President , or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States . </P> <P> This text appears to answer the hypothetical question of whether the office or merely the powers of the Presidency devolved upon the Vice President on his succession . Thus , the 25th Amendment merely restates and reaffirms the validity of existing precedent , apart from adding new protocols for Presidential disability . Not everyone agreed with this interpretation when it was first actually tested , and it was left to Vice President John Tyler , the first presidential successor in U.S. history , to establish the precedent that was respected in the absence of the 25th Amendment . </P> In 1841 , John Tyler became the first person to succeed to the presidency . <P> Upon the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841 and after a brief hesitation , Tyler took the position that he was the President and not merely acting President upon taking the presidential oath of office . However , some contempories -- including John Quincy Adams , Henry Clay and other members of Congress Whig party leaders and even Tyler 's own cabinet -- believed that he was only acting as President and did not have the office itself . </P> <P> Nonetheless , Tyler adhered to his position , even returning , unopened , mail addressed to the `` Acting President of the United States '' sent by his detractors. Tyler 's view ultimately prevailed when the Senate voted to accept the title `` President , '' and this precedent was followed thereafter . The question was finally resolved by Section 1 of the 25th Amendment , which specifies that `` In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation , the Vice President shall become President . '' The Amendment does not specify whether officers other than the Vice President can become President rather than Acting President in the same set of circumstances . The Presidential Succession Act refers only to other officers acting as President rather than becoming President . </P> <H2> History of succession law set by Congress ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Presidential succession Act 1792 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Presidential Succession Act <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : Presidential Succession Act 1792 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The Presidential Succession Act of 1792 was the first succession law passed by Congress . The act was contentious because the Federalists did not want the then Secretary of State , Thomas Jefferson , who had become the leader of the Democratic - Republicans , to follow the Vice President in the succession . There were also separation of powers concerns over including the Chief Justice of the United States in the line . The compromise they worked out established the President pro tempore of the Senate as next in line after the Vice President , followed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives . </P> <P> In either case , these officers were to `` act as President of the United States until the disability be removed or a president be elected . '' The Act called for a special election to be held in November of the year in which dual vacancies occurred ( unless the vacancies occurred after the first Wednesday in October , in which case the election would occur the following year ; or unless the vacancies occurred within the last year of the presidential term , in which case the next election would take place as regularly scheduled ) . The people elected President and Vice President in such a special election would have served a full four - year term beginning on March 4 of the next year , but no such election ever took place . </P> <H3> Presidential succession Act 1886 ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : Presidential Succession Act 1886 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In 1881 , after the death of President Garfield , and in 1885 , after the death of Vice President Hendricks , there had been no President pro tempore in office , and as the new House of Representatives had yet to convene , no Speaker either , leaving no one at all in the line of succession after the vice president . When Congress convened in December 1885 , President Cleveland asked for a revision of the 1792 act , which was passed in 1886 . Congress replaced the President pro tempore and Speaker with officers of the President 's Cabinet with the Secretary of State first in line . In the first 100 years of the United States , six former Secretaries of State had gone on to be elected President , while only two congressional leaders had advanced to that office . As a result , changing the order of the line of succession seemed reasonable . </P> <H3> Presidential succession Act 1947 ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : Presidential Succession Act 1947 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 , signed into law by President Harry S. Truman , added the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore back in the line , but switched the two from the 1792 order . It remains the sequence used today . Since the reorganization of the military in 1947 had merged the War Department ( which governed the Army ) with the Department of the Navy into the Department of Defense , the Secretary of Defense took the place in the order of succession previously held by the Secretary of War . The office of Secretary of the Navy , which had existed as a Cabinet - level position since 1798 , had become subordinate to the Secretary of Defense in the military reorganization , and so was dropped from the line of succession in the 1947 Succession Act . </P> <H3> Postmaster General removed 1971 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Until 1971 , the Postmaster General , the head of the Post Office Department , was a member of the Cabinet , initially the last in the presidential line of succession before new officers were added . Once the Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service , a special agency independent of the executive branch , the Postmaster General ceased to be a member of the Cabinet and was thus removed from the line of succession . </P> <H3> Secretary of Homeland Security added 2006 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The United States Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002 . On March 9 , 2006 , pursuant to the renewal of the Patriot Act as Pub. L. 109 -- 177 , the Secretary of Homeland Security was added to the line of succession . The order of Cabinet members in the line has always been the same as the order in which their respective departments were established . Despite custom , many in Congress had wanted the Secretary to be placed at number eight on the list -- below the Attorney General , above the Secretary of the Interior , and in the position held by the Secretary of the Navy prior to the creation of the Secretary of Defense -- because the Secretary , already in charge of disaster relief and security , would presumably be more prepared to take over the presidency than some of the other Cabinet secretaries . Despite this , the 2006 law explicitly specifies that the `` Secretary of Homeland Security '' follows the `` Secretary of Veterans Affairs '' in the succession , effectively at the end of the list . </P> <H2> Successions beyond Vice President ( edit ) </H2> David Rice Atchison 's tombstone ( Plattsburg , Missouri ) , including the claim `` President of the United States for One Day '' <P> While nine Vice Presidents have succeeded to the office upon the death or resignation of the President , and two Vice Presidents have temporarily served as acting President , no other officer has ever been called upon to act as President . On March 4 , 1849 , President Zachary Taylor 's term began , but he declined to be sworn in on a Sunday , citing religious beliefs , and the Vice President was not sworn either . As the last President pro tempore of the Senate , David Rice Atchison was thought by some to be next in line after the Vice President , and his tombstone claims that he was US President for the day . However , Atchison took no oath of office to the presidency either , and his term as Senate President pro tempore had by then expired . </P> <P> In 1865 , when Andrew Johnson assumed the Presidency on the death of Abraham Lincoln , the office of Vice President became vacant . At that time , the Senate President pro tempore was next in line to the presidency . In 1868 , Johnson was impeached by the House of Representatives and subjected to trial in the Senate , and if he had been convicted and thereby removed from office , Senate President pro tempore Benjamin Wade would have become acting President . This posed a conflict of interest , as Wade 's `` guilty '' vote could have been decisive in removing Johnson from office and giving himself presidential powers and duties . ( Johnson was acquitted by a one - vote margin . ) </P> <P> In his book The Shadow Presidents , which he published in 1979 , Michael Medved describes a situation that arose prior to the 1916 election , when the First World War was raging in Europe . In view of the contemporary international turmoil , President Woodrow Wilson thought that if he lost the election it would be better for his opponent to begin his administration straight away , instead of waiting through the lame duck period , which at that time had a duration of almost four months . President Wilson and his aides formed a plan to exploit the rule of succession so that his rival Charles Evans Hughes could take over the Presidency as soon as the result of the election was clear . The plan was that Wilson would appoint Hughes to the post of Secretary of State . Wilson and his Vice President Thomas R. Marshall would then resign , and as the Secretary of State was at that time designated next in line of succession , Hughes would become President immediately . As it happened , President Wilson won re-election , so the plan was never put into action . </P> New President Gerald Ford is sworn in following the resignation of Richard Nixon on August 9 , 1974 . <P> Since the 25th Amendment 's ratification , its Second Section , which addresses Vice Presidential succession as noted above , has been invoked twice . </P> <P> During the 1973 Vice Presidential vacancy , House Speaker Carl Albert was first in line . As the Watergate scandal made President Nixon 's removal or resignation possible , Albert would have become Acting President and -- under Title 3 , Section 19 ( c ) of the U.S. Code -- would have been able to `` act as President until the expiration of the then current Presidential term '' on January 20 , 1977 . Albert openly questioned whether it was appropriate for him , a Democrat , to assume the powers and duties of the presidency when there was a public mandate for the Presidency to be held by a Republican . Albert announced that should he need to assume the Presidential powers and duties , he would do so only as a caretaker . However , with the nomination and confirmation of Gerald Ford to the Vice Presidency , which marked the first time the Second Section of the Twenty - fifth Amendment was invoked , these series of events were never tested . Albert again became first - in - line during the first four months of Ford 's Presidency , before the confirmation of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller , which marked the second time Section 2 of the Twenty - fifth Amendment was invoked . </P> <P> In 1981 , when President Ronald Reagan was shot , Vice President George H.W. Bush was traveling in Texas . Secretary of State Alexander Haig responded to a reporter 's question regarding who was running the government by stating : </P> <P> Constitutionally , gentlemen , you have the President , the Vice President and the Secretary of State in that order , and should the President decide he wants to transfer the helm to the Vice President , he will do so . He has not done that . As of now , I am in control here , in the White House , pending return of the Vice President and in close touch with him . If something came up , I would check with him , of course . </P> <P> A bitter dispute ensued over the meaning of Haig 's remarks . Most people believed that Haig was referring to the line of succession and erroneously claimed to have temporary Presidential authority , due to his implied reference to the Constitution . Haig and his supporters , noting his familiarity with the line of succession from his time as White House Chief of Staff during Richard Nixon 's resignation , said he only meant that he was the highest - ranking officer of the Executive branch on - site , managing things temporarily until the Vice President returned to Washington . </P> <H2> Constitutional concerns ( edit ) </H2> <P> Several constitutional law experts have raised questions as to the constitutionality of the provisions that the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate succeed to the presidency . James Madison , one of the authors of the Constitution , raised similar constitutional questions about the Presidential Succession Act of 1792 in a 1792 letter to Edmund Pendleton . Two of these issues can be summarized : </P> <Ul> <Li> The term `` Officer '' in the relevant clause of the Constitution is most plausibly interpreted to mean an `` Officer of the United States '' , who must be a member of the Executive or Judicial Branch . The Speaker and the President pro tempore are not officers in this sense . </Li> <Li> Under the principle of separation of powers , the Constitution specifically disallows legislative officials from also serving in the executive branch . For the Speaker or the Senate President pro tempore to become Acting President , they must resign their position , at which point they are no longer in the line of succession . This is seen by some to form a constitutional paradox . However , the current Act specifies that the Speaker becomes President `` upon his resignation as Speaker '' and as a member of Congress , allowing for a seamless transition . </Li> </Ul> <P> In 2003 the Continuity of Government Commission suggested that the current law has `` at least seven significant issues ... that warrant attention '' , specifically : </P> <Ol> <Li> The reality that all figures in the current line of succession work and reside in the vicinity of Washington , D.C. In the event of a nuclear , chemical , or biological attack , it is possible that everyone on the list would be killed or incapacitated . </Li> <Li> Doubt ( such as those expressed above by James Madison ) that congressional leaders are eligible to act as President . </Li> <Li> A concern about the wisdom of including the President pro tempore in the line of succession as the `` largely honorific post traditionally held by the longest - serving Senator of the majority party '' . For example , from January 20 , 2001 , to June 6 , 2001 , the President pro tempore was then - 98 - year - old Strom Thurmond of South Carolina . </Li> <Li> A concern that the current line of succession can force the presidency to abruptly switch parties mid-term , as the President , Speaker , and the President pro tempore are not necessarily of the same party as each other . </Li> <Li> A concern that the succession line is ordered by the dates of creation of the various executive departments , without regard to the skills or capacities of the persons serving as their Secretary . </Li> <Li> The fact that , should a Cabinet member begin to act as President , the law allows the House to elect a new Speaker ( or the Senate , a new President pro tempore ) , who could in effect remove the Cabinet member and assume the office themselves at any time . </Li> <Li> The absence of a provision where a President is disabled and the vice presidency is vacant ( for example , if an assassination attempt simultaneously wounded the President and killed the Vice President ) . </Li> </Ol> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Central Locator System </Li> <Li> Designated survivor </Li> <Li> List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots </Li> <Li> United States presidential line of succession in fiction </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 19 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Is the Presidential Succession Law Constitutional ?

The FIFA World Cup is the premier competitive international football tournament , first played in 1930 , whose finals stage has been held every four years since , except 1942 and 1946 , due to the Second World War . </P> <P> The tournament consists of two parts , the qualification phase and the final phase ( officially called the World Cup Finals ) . The qualification phase , which currently take place over the three years preceding the finals , is used to determine which teams qualify for the finals . The current format of the finals involves thirty - two teams competing for the title , at venues within the host nation ( or nations ) over a period of about a month . The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world , with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 Final . </P> <P> England did not enter the competition until 1950 , but have entered all eighteen subsequent tournaments . They have failed to qualify for the finals on three occasions , 1974 ( West Germany ) , 1978 ( Argentina ) and 1994 ( United States ) , and have failed to advance from the group stages on three occasions ; at the 1950 FIFA World Cup , the 1958 FIFA World Cup and the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Their best ever performance is winning the Cup in the 1966 tournament held in England , whilst they also finished in fourth place in 1990 , in Italy , and in 2018 in Russia . Other than that , the team have reached the quarter - finals on nine occasions , the latest of which were at the 2002 ( South Korea / Japan ) and the 2006 ( Germany ) . </P> <P> England are the only team not representing a sovereign state to win the World Cup , which they did in 1966 when they hosted the finals . They defeated West Germany 4 -- 2 after extra time to win the World Cup title . Since then , they have generally reached the knockout stages of almost every competition they have qualified for , including a fourth - place finish in the 1990 and 2018 World Cups . At the world cup , England have had more goalless draws than any other team . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Brazil 1950 <Ul> <Li> 1.1. 1 1950 Finals </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.2 Switzerland 1954 <Ul> <Li> 1.2. 1 1954 Finals </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.3 Sweden 1958 </Li> <Li> 1.4 Chile 1962 </Li> <Li> 1.5 England 1966 </Li> <Li> 1.6 Mexico 1970 </Li> <Li> 1.7 West Germany 1974 </Li> <Li> 1.8 Argentina 1978 </Li> <Li> 1.9 Spain 1982 </Li> <Li> 1.10 Mexico 1986 </Li> <Li> 1.11 Italy 1990 </Li> <Li> 1.12 United States 1994 </Li> <Li> 1.13 France 1998 </Li> <Li> 1.14 South Korea / Japan 2002 </Li> <Li> 1.15 Germany 2006 </Li> <Li> 1.16 South Africa 2010 </Li> <Li> 1.17 Brazil 2014 </Li> <Li> 1.18 Russia 2018 <Ul> <Li> 1.18. 1 2018 Finals </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Records <Ul> <Li> 2.1 By match </Li> <Li> 2.2 By opponent </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Players ' honours <Ul> <Li> 3.1 List of England players with the most appearances at World Cups </Li> <Li> 3.2 List of England top goalscorers at World Cups </Li> <Li> 3.3 List of England goals by tournament </Li> <Li> 3.4 List of England players playing abroad at a World Cup </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Team awards and records </Li> <Li> 5 Refereeing </Li> <Li> 6 Notes and references <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Notes </Li> <Li> 6.2 References </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Brazil 1950 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1950 FIFA World Cup See also : 1949 -- 50 British Home Championship <P> England 's first qualifying campaign for the FIFA World Cup doubled as the 1950 British Home Championship . The series kicked off for England on 15 October 1949 at Ninian Park , Cardiff , against Wales . Stan Mortensen gave England the lead after twenty two minutes , and just seven minutes later , Jackie Milburn doubled the lead . This was the first goal of Milburn 's hat trick , which left England 4 -- 0 up with 20 minutes to play . Mal Griffiths scored a consolation goal for Wales ten minutes from time , but England held on for a comfortable victory . </P> <P> A month later , England welcomed Ireland to Maine Road , and it began well for the home side as Jack Rowley scored inside six minutes . England were already 6 -- 0 up , thanks to Jack Froggatt , two for Stan Pearson , Stan Mortensen and a second from Rowley , by the time Ireland struck back through Samuel Smyth after 55 minutes . Rowley added a third and a fourth to his tally in the three minutes following Smyth 's goal , however , leaving the score at 8 -- 1 at the hour mark . The frantic scoring rate calmed down after that , with only one apeice before the final whistle , with Stan Pearson completing his brace for England 's ninth , and Bobby Brennan scoring for Ireland . </P> <P> It was not until May 1950 that England travelled to Hampden Park to face Scotland , who were also undefeated after their games against Ireland and Wales . With the top two from the group qualifying , both teams were guaranteed progression to the finals , and the game was solely for the honour of winning the British Home Championship , and the seeding advantage to be enjoyed upon reaching Brazil . A solitary goal from Roy Bentley gave England the victory , the title and the top spot in the group . </P> 1950 finals ( edit ) <P> England were seeded in pot one for the finals , which meant they were the favourites to progress from Group 2 , which also contained Spain , Chile and the United States . England 's campaign kicked off against Chile in Rio de Janeiro , and , as was expected , England cruised to a 2 -- 0 victory , courtesy of goals from Stan Mortensen and Wilf Mannion . </P> Main article : United States v England ( 1950 FIFA World Cup ) <P> Their troubles began four days later when they faced the Americans in Belo Horizonte in what has become one of the most famous matches of all time . Joe Gaetjens scored the only goal of the match to give the United States an unlikely victory , which has gone down as one of the World Cup 's greatest upsets . A myth arose that the English newspapers were so confident of an English victory that when the result was telegrammed back , they assumed a misprint and printed the score as 10 -- 1 in England 's favour . However , this has proven to be untrue . </P> <P> This left England in a sticky situation prior to their final match , against Spain in Rio . They needed to win , and for Chile to beat the United States to stand any chance of going through , and even then they would need the goal averages to fall in their favour . As it turned out , no such calculations were necessary , despite Chile 's victory , as Spain 's Zarra scored the only goal of the game , eliminating England from the competition . </P> <H3> Switzerland 1954 ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( July 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> Main articles : 1954 FIFA World Cup and 1953 -- 54 British Home Championship <P> As with their first World Cup , England 's qualifying for the 1954 edition also constituted the 1953 -- 54 British Home Championship . They played Wales at Ninian Park as their first match once again , and the 4 -- 1 result was the same . However , unlike four years earlier , it was the home side that went into the lead , after twenty two minutes through Ivor Allchurch . Despite being 1 -- 0 down at half time , England scored four within eight minutes of the restart ; two each for Dennis Wilshaw and Nat Lofthouse . </P> <P> Goodison Park was the venue for England 's home clash against Ireland , who were newly renamed Northern Ireland . Harold Hassall got England off to a good start with a goal after just ten minutes . Eddie McMorran put the Irish back on terms just before the hour mark , but Hassall completed his brace six minutes later . Lofthouse completed a comfortable 3 -- 1 win for England . </P> <P> With the top two in the group qualifying for the finals , the final game between England and Scotland , at Hampden Park , settled nothing except the placings within the group , despite Scotland having dropped a point with a 3 -- 3 draw at home to Wales . Allan Brown put the home side ahead after just seven minutes , but it was all square again thanks to Ivor Broadis just four minutes later . Johnny Nicholls gave England the lead for the first time just after half time , and they began to extend a lead after Ronnie Allen 's 68th - minute goal . Jimmy Mullen made the game all but certain seven minutes from time , and although Willie Ormond scored a consolation for Scotland with just 1 minute to play , England topped the competition for the second time in a row . </P> 1954 finals ( edit ) <P> England were drawn in Group 4 for the finals , with hosts Switzerland , Italy and Belgium . In an odd twist , unique to the 1954 tournament , England and Italy , as the two seeded teams in the group , did not have to play each other . </P> <P> Equally , Switzerland and Belgium did not have to play each other . England 's first game in Switzerland was against Belgium in Basel , and they suffered a shock as L\u00e9opold Anoul put the Belgians into the lead after just five minutes . Ivor Broadis put the favourites back on terms just over twenty minutes later , and although Nat Lofthouse gave England the lead 10 minutes later , it was proving to be tougher than they had expected against the Belgians . </P> <P> Broadis scored his second just after the hour , but Henri Coppens hit back four minutes later to keep Belgium in the game at only 3 -- 2 down . Anoul completed his brace another four minutes after that to level the scores again . In another oddity peculiar to this World Cup , drawn matches in the group stage would go to extra time , and as such the teams played on with the score at 3 -- 3 . </P> <P> Just one minute into the added period , Lofthouse added a fourth for England and they seemed to have won it , but Jimmy Dickinson scored an own goal three minutes later to put the score back at 4 -- 4 . It stayed this way until the extra period was up , and as penalty shoot - outs were yet to be invented and replays were not used in the group , the match was recorded as a draw . </P> <P> England 's second and final group game was against the hosts in Bern . This proved to be an easier game for the Three Lions , and they scored one goal in each half ( from Jimmy Mullen and Dennis Wilshaw respectively ) to give them a comfortable win of 2 -- 0 . As Switzerland ( against England ) , Italy ( against Switzerland ) and Belgium ( against Italy ) had all lost one game , England progressed as group winners , along with Switzerland , who won a play - off against Italy . </P> <P> England faced the winners of group three and defending champions Uruguay in the quarter - finals . Carlos Borges gave the South Americans the lead inside 5 minutes , but Lofthouse put England back on terms ten minutes later . England were clearly struggling , but held on until just before half time , when Obdulio Varela gave the lead back Uruguay . </P> <P> Juan Alberto Schiaffino doubled the lead just after the break , but Tom Finney kept England 's foot in the door with his sixty seventh - minute goal . However , it was all over after Javier Ambrois restored the two - goal lead with twelve minutes to play . The score remained at 4 -- 2 , and England were eliminated from the cup . </P> <H3> Sweden 1958 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1958 FIFA World Cup <P> For the first time , England had to play against countries other than the Home Nations to reach the Finals in Sweden . They were drawn against the Republic of Ireland and Denmark . In the qualifying round , England won three out of the four games and drew the other . Four months before the World Cup , Roger Byrne , Duncan Edwards , David Pegg and Tommy Taylor all lost their lives in the Munich air disaster while playing for Manchester United . At the finals , which is the only tournament to have seen all Home Nations take part , the Home Nations were all drawn in different groups . </P> <P> England were drawn against the Soviet Union ( 2 -- 2 ) , Brazil ( 0 -- 0 ) and Austria ( 2 -- 2 ) , who finished third in the 1954 World Cup . At the end of the group stage , Soviet Union and England each had three points , and had scored four goals and conceded four goals . This meant there was a play - off to decide the second - placed team in the group , the winner to qualify . England lost the play - off 1 -- 0 and were thus knocked out . The only consolation for England was that they were the only team to play the eventual winners Brazil and not lose . </P> <H3> Chile 1962 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1962 FIFA World Cup <P> The third World Cup which took place in South America , saw England qualify by successfully qualifying from the group , which contained Portugal and Luxembourg , defeating Luxembourg on both occasions , and defeating Portugal at home , and drawing in Lisbon . </P> <P> At the finals , England were drawn in a group with Hungary , Argentina and Bulgaria . England defeated Argentina 3 - 1 , thanks to goals from Ron Flowers , Bobby Charlton and Jimmy Greaves , before playing out a goalless draw with Bulgaria , and a 2 -- 1 defeat to Hungary . </P> <P> England finished in second place behind Hungary and played the winners of group 3 , defending champions Brazil , in the quarter - finals . Brazil scored first through Garrincha , before an equaliser for Gerry Hitchens before half time . However , second - half goals from Garrincha and Vav\u00e1 meant Brazil won the game 3 -- 1 , and eliminated England from the competition . This defeat was manager Walter Winterbottom 's last game in charge . Winterbottom had led England to four World Cup Finals . From May 1963 , Alf Ramsey became the manager of England . </P> <H3> England 1966 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1966 FIFA World Cup <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( July 2018 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In the 1966 World Cup Finals , England used their home advantage and , under Ramsey , won their first , and only , World Cup title . England played all their games at Wembley Stadium in London , which became the last time that the hosts were granted this privilege . After drawing 0 -- 0 in the opening game against former champions Uruguay , which started a run of four games all ending goalless . England then beat both France and Mexico 2 -- 0 and qualified for the quarter - finals . </P> <P> The quarter - finals saw England play Argentina , which ended in a 1 -- 0 win to England . This match saw the start of the rivalry between England and Argentina , when Argentinian Antonio Ratt\u00edn was dismissed by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein in a very fierce game . A 2 -- 1 win against Portugal in the semi-final then followed . Portugal were the first team to score against England in the tournament . The final saw England play West Germany , with the result finishing in a 4 -- 2 win for England , after extra time . </P> <H3> Mexico 1970 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1970 FIFA World Cup <P> 1970 saw the first World Cup finals take place in North America and England qualified automatically for the tournament by winning the 1966 FIFA World Cup . England were drawn in a group with Romania , former world champions Brazil and Czechoslovakia . Each of the matches only saw one goal , with England defeating Romania and Czechoslovakia , and losing to Brazil . The quarter - final saw a repeat of the 1966 final , with England playing West Germany . England were hampered by the fact that first - choice goalkeeper Gordon Banks was ill , and Peter Bonetti played instead . England led 2 -- 0 with goals by Alan Mullery and Martin Peters , but in the 70th minute , Franz Beckenbauer pulled one goal back for West Germany . </P> <P> After Beckenbauer 's goal , Ramsey substituted Bobby Charlton , who overtook Billy Wright as England 's most capped player ever , with caps totalling 106 . Uwe Seeler equalised for the Germans in the eighty first minute , thereby taking the game into extra time . During extra time , Gerd M\u00fcller scored the winning goal for West Germany which saw the German side win 3 -- 2 . This turned out to be Charlton 's last game for England . </P> <H3> West Germany 1974 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification <P> For the first time , England did not qualify for a World Cup . In a group with Olympic champions Poland and Wales , England could not overtake Poland . After only drawing at home to Wales 1 -- 1 and losing the first leg 2 -- 0 to Poland , meant that England had to beat Poland at home , whilst Poland only needed to draw . Poland managed to withstand England 's attacks in the first half , who had Martin Peters playing for them . Poland took the lead in the 57th minute with a goal from Jan Domarski . </P> <P> England equalised six minutes later , with a penalty converted by Allan Clarke . England were unable to score any more goals with goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski keeping England at bay . Brian Clough had previously called Tomaszewski a `` clown '' . The commentator of the game then said `` it 's all over '' . Poland took this good form to the finals and ended in third place . After failing to qualify , Alf Ramsey resigned from his post and after a time , where Ramsey and his predecessor had lasted a total of 29 years , no manager was able to last in the job for longer than eight years . This ended when Bobby Robson became England manager . </P> <H3> Argentina 1978 ( edit ) </H3> See also : 1978 FIFA World Cup qualification <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

This time , England were denied by Italy , who had scored three more goals than England after both teams finished on the same points . Goals scored dictated who qualified after the head - to - head record between the two sides finished the same , following a 2 -- 0 home win for each team . The lower - ranked teams in the group were Finland and Luxembourg , but the size of the wins against them proved to be decisive . Nevertheless , Ron Greenwood was given a second chance in charge of England , after taking the role in 1977 . </P> <H3> Spain 1982 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1982 FIFA World Cup <P> 1982 saw the first time where the European Qualifying Rounds were divided into groups of five teams , where the top two teams qualify for the World Cup . Greenwood used his second chance and took England to Spain by finishing second behind Hungary and above Romania , Switzerland and Norway . </P> <P> At the finals , England won all three group games , defeating France 3 - 1 , with a brace from Bryan Robson , before beating Czechoslovakia 2 -- 0 , with a Jozef Barmos own goal , and World Cup newcomers Kuwait 1 -- 0 , thanks to a Trevor Francis goal . </P> <P> The next round saw a second group stage consisting of three teams , a first time event at the World Cup . England drew with West Germany 0 -- 0 and after the Germans beat Spain 2 -- 1 , England then had to beat Spain with a two - goal difference to progress to the next round . England , however , only managed a 0 -- 0 draw against the Spanish . England remained unbeaten at the end of the tournament . After the World Cup , Ron Greenwood 's time as England manager ended , and he was replaced by Bobby Robson . </P> <H3> Mexico 1986 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1986 FIFA World Cup <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( July 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> 1986 saw the second World Cup to take place in Mexico . England qualified for Mexico 1986 by winning four games and drawing four times against Northern Ireland , who qualified in second place , Romania , Finland and Turkey . In Mexico , England lost their opening game to Portugal 1 -- 0 and could only manage a goalless draw against Morocco . The final group game , however , saw England beat Poland 3 -- 0 , which is one of the three highest scores for England at the World Cup , with Gary Lineker scoring a hat - trick . </P> <P> This result took England to second place and finished behind Morocco . England then also beat Paraguay 3 -- 0 in the Round of 16 . In the quarter - finals , England renewed their rivalry with Argentina in a game that has become notorious for the Argentina goals , both scored by Diego Maradona . Maradona 's first goal , known as the Hand of God , was illegal and should not have counted , as he used his hand to punch the ball into the net . However , the referee missed this infringement , and ruled that the goal should stand . Maradona then made the score 2 - 0 , famously dribbling from inside Argentina 's half and around several English players before scoring . Gary Lineker pulled back the score to 2 - 1 , but England ran out of time to equalise , and were eliminated . Nevertheless , Lineker finished with the Golden Boot by scoring six goals and thereby becoming England 's first Golden Boot winner . </P> <H3> Italy 1990 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1990 FIFA World Cup <P> By winning three and drawing three , England qualified for Italia ' 90 , the second World Cup to be held in Italy , scoring ten goals and conceding none . England were unbeaten through qualification , winning three games , and drawing the remaining three , but still finished second to Sweden , whom they drew with twice . England profited from Romania 's 3 -- 1 win over Denmark , who , had they won , would have qualified as the third - best second - placed team . West Germany and England were able to qualify for Italia ' 90 as the best second - placed teams in the groups with four teams . </P> <P> Because a few years previously saw English hooligans at European competition matches , England were forced to play their group games on Sardinia and Sicily . In group F , was the European champions Netherlands , the Republic of Ireland and Egypt and England . After opening the tournament with a 1 -- 1 draw against Ireland and a 0 -- 0 draw against the Dutch , England then beat Egypt 1 -- 0 . This was Egypt 's first appearance since the 1934 World Cup . England won the group with four points . </P> <P> In the next round , England had to play Belgium . The game went to extra time , and in the hundredth and nineteenth minute , David Platt scored the winning goal . England also had to play extra time against Cameroon in the quarter - finals . Cameroon were the first African team to have reached the quarter - finals . England opened the scoring through David Platt , but Cameroon quickly turned around the game to lead 2 - 1 . Lineker subsequently won and scored a penalty in the 83rd minute to ensure the game went to extra time . He then scored a second penalty , to see England reach the semi-finals . </P> <P> In the semi-finals , England met West Germany . There was no separating the two teams after 90 minutes , which made England the first team to have played extra time in three successive World Cup games . There was also no separating the two teams after extra time , thereby taking the game to penalties . </P> <P> Although English goalkeeper Peter Shilton dived the right way for every penalty , he was unable to save any . German goalkeeper Bodo Illgner , having failed to save any of England 's first three penalties , saved England 's fourth penalty , taken by Stuart Pearce . Olaf Thon then scored for Germany , meaning that England 's Chris Waddle would have to score his fifth penalty and hope that Shilton saved the Germans ' fifth penalty . However , Waddle 's penalty missed completely , going high over the crossbar , thereby resulting in England 's being knocked out of the competition . The third - place playoff between England and Italy saw England lose their only game of the tournament in normal time . Even though this was England 's best finish since the 1966 World Cup , Bobby Robson 's time as England manager had come to an end . </P> <H3> United States 1994 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification <P> For the 1994 World Cup in the United States , under the leadership of new manager Graham Taylor , England surprisingly did not qualify for the tournament . In a group with six teams , England lost to Norway and the Netherlands , finishing third above Poland , Turkey and San Marino . </P> <P> England went into their final game with San Marino knowing they would need a seven - goal victory and for Poland to beat the Netherlands in the other match in order to qualify . In the game against San Marino , Davide Gualtieri scored against England after nine seconds , taking the lead for the outsiders . England went on to win 7 -- 1 , which was too small a goal margin . Additionally , despite the half - time score between the Poles and the Dutch being 1 - 1 , the Dutch went on to win 3 - 1 , meaning that however many goals England scored , they could still not qualify . Taylor 's tenure in charge ended and he was replaced by Terry Venables , who was dismissed after England lost the semi-final of Euro 1996 , hosted in England . </P> <H3> France 1998 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 1998 FIFA World Cup <P> After missing out on the World Cup in 1994 , England , managed by Glenn Hoddle , qualified for the World Cup in France . England were drawn in Group 2 of UEFA qualifying with Italy , Poland , Georgia and Moldova . England beat Poland , Georgia and Moldova both home and away , but a home defeat to Italy in their fourth match meant they went into the final qualifier at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome just a point ahead of the Azzurri and only needing a draw to qualify automatically ; defeat would see them have to navigate a play - off to secure qualification . The match finished as a goalless draw and England finished top of the group . </P> <P> At the finals in France , England played in Group G. England defeated Tunisia 2 -- 0 in the first game , with goals from Alan Shearer and Paul Scholes . Their second match saw England lose 2 -- 1 to Romania ; despite an 81st - minute equaliser from Michael Owen , Dan Petrescu scored a winner shortly before injury time . In their final group game , England defeated Colombia 2 -- 0 in the decisive match , thanks to goals from midfielders Darren Anderton and David Beckham . England finished second in Group G , which saw them qualify for the last 16 phase , and play the winner of 1998 FIFA World Cup Group H , Argentina . </P> <P> In a fiery game containing six yellow cards and two penalties , David Beckham was controversially sent off in the 47th minute for what many felt was at most a yellow card offence , knocking over Diego Simeone . Gabriel Batistuta opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the fifth minute of the game , before an equaliser also from the spot by Alan Shearer four minutes later . England took the lead through Owen , in the 16th minute . Argentina drew level through Javier Zanetti in injury time of the first half . </P> <P> The game finished 2 - 2 , and , as neither team were able to find a winner in extra time , penalties were needed to decide the team that qualified to the next round . While David Seaman did save one penalty , Argentine goalkeeper Carlos Roa managed to save two , including the vital one from David Batty , thereby knocking England out of the World Cup . Beckham subsequently received death threats and was sent bullets in the post . </P> <H3> South Korea / Japan 2002 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 2002 FIFA World Cup <P> In 2002 the World Cup took place in Asia for the first time . England , under its first ever foreign manager in Swedish Sven - G\u00f6ran Eriksson , were able to qualify for the tournament . England were drawn in Group 9 , alongside Germany , Finland , Greece and Albania . In the last ever game in the original Wembley Stadium , ( which closed after the match ) England played Germany , losing 1 -- 0 , the only goal scored by Dietmar Hamann . The match was the last under the management of Kevin Keegan , who resigned at the end of the match , and was replaced by Eriksson . By beating Germany 5 -- 1 in Munich , England 's qualifying campaign was revitalised , and they qualified automatically , by drawing 2 -- 2 with Greece . Germany , who could only draw 0 -- 0 with Finland , had to play a play - off game against Ukraine , with England qualifying ahead winning the group . </P> <P> In Japan , England had to play against Eriksson 's homeland , Sweden , and both settled out for a 1 -- 1 draw . England and Beckham gained a measure of revenge for their previous 1998 defeat in defeating Argentina 1 - 0 , thanks to a Beckham penalty . However , England could only manage a disappointing 0 - 0 draw against Nigeria , meaning that although they were able to qualify for the second round , where they played Denmark , they qualified as runners up , which meant that they would meet favourites Brazil in the quarter - finals if they qualified . </P> <P> England played Denmark in the round of 16 defeating Denmark 3 -- 0 , thanks to goals from Micheal Owen , Rio Ferdinand , and Emile Heskey . England played four - time World Cup winners and 1998 runners - up Brazil in the quarter - finals . Despite leading through a Michael Owen goal , a mistake by David Seaman saw England lose 2 -- 1 , and Brazil won their fourth World Cup match against England , and went on to win the tournament . </P> <H3> Germany 2006 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 2006 FIFA World Cup <P> England were drawn into Group 6 of European qualifying for the 2006 World Cup . The group featured other home nations in Wales , and Northern Ireland , as well as Poland ( who had eliminated England the last time the World Cup took place in Germany ) , Azerbaijan and Austria . England won eight of the 10 games , and qualified as group winners , in front of Portugal , despite drawing to Austria in Vienna , and losing to Northern Ireland in Belfast . </P> <P> In Germany , however , England were less convincing . England played in Group B , alongside Paraguay , Trinidad and Tobago , and Sweden . England started with a 1 -- 0 win against Paraguay ; which was won due to a 3rd minute own goal . The second game against first time qualifiers Trinidad and Tobago saw England have to wait until the 83rd minute for England to take the lead , with Peter Crouch opened the scoring with a goal many felt was illegal , and the second goal of the game coming in added time from Steven Gerrard . The last group game saw England play against Sweden , where an eventual 2 - 2 draw saw them qualify for the next round as group winners , thereby avoiding playing hosts Germany . </P> <P> In the last 16 stage , a free kick from David Beckham saw England win 1 -- 0 against Ecuador and reach the quarter - finals , where they faced Portugal . The game finished goalless , and England once again were knocked out on penalties and Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo became the first goalkeeper to save three penalties in a penalty shoot - out . Ricardo saved from Frank Lampard , Steven Gerrard , and Jamie Carragher ; the only England player who successfully converted his penalty was Owen Hargreaves . Portugal won the shoot - out 3 - 1 , despite misses from Petit and Hugo Viana . This game was also Erickson 's final match as England manager . </P> <H3> South africa 2010 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 2010 FIFA World Cup <P> Qualification for the first African World Cup went successfully for new England manager Fabio Capello , after previous manager Steve McClaren was unable to secure qualification to the Euro 2008 . By winning nine times and only losing to Ukraine , England qualified ahead of Croatia , Belarus , Kazakhstan and Andorra . England 's group was seen as a favourable one , containing comparatively much weaker teams . However , England opened up their campaign with a 1 -- 1 draw against the United States , thanks to a major error by goalkeeper Robert Green . They then drew 0 -- 0 against Algeria and were booed off the field by their own fans , drawing the ire of striker Wayne Rooney . England eventually qualified for the next round by beating Slovenia 1 -- 0 , but only qualified as runners up to the United States , thereby meaning they would draw favourites Germany . </P> <P> In the second round match , Germany took the lead after 20 minutes after goalkeeper Manuel Neuer played the ball down the pitch to Miroslav Klose , who opened the scoring . The score became 2 -- 0 to Germany after 32 minutes . Shortly after , England defender Matthew Upson scored a header . Later , Frank Lampard had a shot at goal which was disallowed despite crossing the line ; which was confirmed on replays . German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer admitted subsequently he knew the ball had crossed the line , but decided to deceive the referee . The German media reported it was `` revenge for Wembley '' , while the English media criticised FIFA 's refusal to implement goal - line technology . Ironically , despite his earlier opposition to goal - line technology , Sepp Blatter said that it should be introduced after a Ukrainian goal against England at Euro 2012 was ruled out . As England tried to equalise , Germany used this to their advantage and scored two more goals . This became Germany 's biggest win against England in a World Cup , winning 4 - 1 . </P> <H3> Brazil 2014 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 2014 FIFA World Cup <P> Under Roy Hodgson , who replaced Fabio Capello after Euro 2012 after a disagreement between Capello and The FA , England qualified for the second World Cup to be held in Brazil . Ukraine were again one of the opponents in the qualifying rounds . The other opponents included Montenegro , Poland , Moldova and San Marino . After winning six games and drawing four , England qualified unbeaten . </P> <P> The draw for the finals saw England have to play against Italy and Uruguay , both former world champions , which meant that it was the first ever time three World Champions were drawn in the same group , along with Costa Rica . England lost to Italy and Uruguay , and were thus knocked out after two games . The final match against Costa Rica finished as a goalless draw . This performance was statistically their worst ever performance at a World Cup , ending up with just one point after two losses to Uruguay and Italy and a goalless draw with Costa Rica in the dead rubber match , their lowest points total in the group stage of a world cup . </P> <H3> Russia 2018 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 2018 FIFA World Cup <P> England played in UEFA Group F in qualification for the 2018 World Cup , in a group of six with Slovakia , Slovenia , Scotland , Lithuania and Malta , with only the winner of the group guaranteed qualification . England went into the qualification process under manager Sam Allardyce , only for Allardyce to leave the post after just one game due to controversy regarding discussing breaking FIFA rules . </P> <P> Under Allardyce 's replacement , Gareth Southgate , England went undefeated throughout qualification , winning eight matches out of 10 , drawing with Slovenia 0 -- 0 in Ljubljana , and drawing 2 -- 2 with Scotland in Glasgow thanks to a 90th - minute equaliser from Harry Kane . This was the third successive major tournament that England were undefeated , having been undefeated in 2014 World Cup , and Euro 2016 qualifying . </P> 2018 finals ( edit ) England national team at the 2018 World Cup in Russia <P> Under Gareth Southgate , the England team began their tournament in group G against Tunisia . The game started well for England with a goal from Harry Kane in the 11th minute . Tunisia equalised through Sassi from the penalty spot in the 35th minute following a foul by Kyle Walker . Some controversy followed as various potential offences against Harry Kane , inside the penalty area were ignored by the referee and no VAR checks were carried out . England persevered and scored a second goal in the 91st minute , again by Harry Kane , resulting in a 2 -- 1 victory . </P> <P> In the second group stage match , England surpassed their record for goals scored in a World Cup match by beating Panama 6 - 1 . Jesse Lingard scored the third goal , John Stones scored the first and fourth goals and Harry Kane scored a hat - trick with the second , fifth and sixth goals . </P> <P> In the final group stage match , England narrowly lost 1 - 0 to Belgium . Adnan Januzaj scored the sole goal of the game ; but with both teams having fielded reserve teams , with England specificially making 9 changes . Before the game media outlets stating that a loss could potentially become beneficial , as the winner would be in the half of the draw with four of the top seven sides in the world . The result that meant Belgium topped the group and England finished second , setting up a last 16 clash with Group H winners Colombia . </P> <P> England played their last 16 match in the Otkritie Arena , Moscow , with the same team as against Tunisia . Harry Kane scored his sixth goal of the tournament , and the third penalty , after once again being fouled in the box from a corner , similarly as against Panama . The score remained at 1 - 0 , until stoppage time , where a header from Yerry Mina beat Jordan Pickford in goal to bring the game to extra time . Neither team managed to score in extra time , and the match went to penalties , which England won 4 - 3 . As well as being the first knockout match England had won at a major tournament since 2006 ( last defeating Ecuador in the last 16 ) ; it was the first time England won a World Cup penalty shoot - out . The match was notable for the heated atmosphere the game was played in , with a total of eight yellow cards being shown in the match . </P> <P> England played against Sweden in their quarter - final at Cosmos Arena , Samara on 7 July 2018 . They won the match 2 -- 0 , with defender Harry Maguire scoring his first England goal , a header scored from a corner , and Dele Alli a second header from close range . This would send them through to their third World Cup semi-final and their first since 1990 , and third overall . The team played Croatia in the semi-final , resulting in a 2 -- 1 loss after extra time . England would later finish fourth in the competition , the best result since 1990 . England would lose again to Belgium in the 3rd place playoff , thanks to goals from Thomas Meunier and Eden Hazard , despite a Eric Dier shot being cleared off the line by Toby Alderweireld . </P> <P> The tournament would see England score nine goals from set - pieces -- the most by a team in a single World Cup tournament since 1966 . </P> <H2> Records ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th>

This character was cut from the film , but is featured in the deleted scenes . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> <P> Previously , Disney had begun work on a film adaptation of the 1994 Broadway musical . However , in a 2011 interview , composer Alan Menken stated the planned film version of the Beauty and the Beast stage musical `` was canned '' . </P> <P> By April 2014 , Walt Disney Pictures had already begun developing a new live - action version and remake of Beauty and the Beast after making other live - action fantasy films such as Alice in Wonderland , Maleficent , Cinderella and The Jungle Book . In June 2014 , Bill Condon was signed to direct the film from a script by Evan Spiliotopoulos . Later in September of that same year , Stephen Chbosky ( who had previously directed Watson in The Perks of Being a Wallflower ) was hired to re-write the script . </P> <P> Before Condon was hired to direct the film , Disney approached him with a proposal to remake the film in a more radical way as Universal Studios had remade Snow White and the Huntsman ( 2012 ) . Condon later explained that `` after Frozen opened , the studio saw that there was this big international audience for an old - school - musical approach . But initially , they said , ' We 're interested in a musical to a degree , but only half full of songs . ' My interest was taking that film and doing it in this new medium -- live - action -- as a full - on musical movie . So I backed out for a minute , and they came back and said , ' No , no , no , we get it , let 's pursue it that way . ' '' Walt Disney Pictures president of production Sean Bailey credited Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn with the decision to make the film as a musical : `` We worked on this for five or six years , and for 18 months to two years , Beauty was a serious dramatic project , and the scripts were written to reflect that . It was n't a musical at that time . But we just could n't get it to click and it was Alan Horn who championed the idea of owning the Disney of it all . We realized there was a competitive advantage in the songs . What is wrong with making adults feel like kids again ? '' </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> In January 2015 , Emma Watson announced that she would be starring as Belle , the female lead . Watson was the first choice of Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn , as he had previously overseen Warner Bros. which released the eight Harry Potter films that co-starred Watson as Hermione Granger . Two months later , Luke Evans and Dan Stevens were revealed to be in talks to play Gaston and the Beast respectively , and Watson confirmed their casting the following day through tweets . The rest of the principal cast , including Josh Gad , Emma Thompson , Kevin Kline , Audra McDonald , Ian McKellen , Gugu Mbatha - Raw , Ewan McGregor and Stanley Tucci were announced between March and April to play LeFou , Mrs. Potts , Maurice , Madame de Garderobe , Cogsworth , Plumette , Lumi\u00e8re and Cadenza , respectively . </P> <P> Susan Egan , who originated the role of Belle on Broadway , commented on the casting of Watson as `` perfect '' . Paige O'Hara , who voiced Belle in the original animated film and its sequels , offered to help Watson with her singing lessons . </P> <P> According to The Hollywood Reporter , Emma Watson was reportedly paid $3 million upfront , together with an agreement that her final take - home pay could rise as high as $15 million if the film generated gross box office income similar to Maleficent 's $759 million worldwide gross . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Principal photography on the film began at Shepperton Studios in Surrey , England , on May 18 , 2015 . Filming with the principal actors concluded on August 21 . Six days later , co-producer Jack Morrissey confirmed that the film had officially wrapped production . </P> <P> The Beast was portrayed with a `` more traditional motion capture puppeteering for the body and the physical orientation '' , where actor Dan Stevens was `` in a forty - pound gray suit on stilts for much of the film '' . The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to `` communicate the subtleties of the human face '' and `` ( capture the ) thought that occurs to him '' which gets `` through ( to ) the eyes , which are the last human element in the Beast . '' The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with CGI animation . </P> <P> Before the release of the film , Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the `` Days of the Sun '' number , due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones , who looked similar to Hattie Morahan , who portrayed Agathe . In the original version of the scene , it was Jones ' character , the Prince 's mother , who sings the first verse of the song , with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and Henry Garrett playing his father ; but in the reshot version of the scene , the singing part is given to the Prince ( now played by Adam Mitchell ) . The King was also recast to Tom Turner , although Harriet Jones was still the Queen , albeit with dark hair . Both Goodman and Garrett 's names were mistakenly featured in the original theatrical release 's credits , but was later corrected in home releases . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Beauty and the Beast ( 2017 soundtrack ) <P> When released in 1991 , Beauty and the Beast marked a turning point for Walt Disney Pictures by appealing to millions of fans with its Oscar - winning musical score by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken . In Bill Condon 's opinion , that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live - action version of the movie . `` That score had more to reveal '' , he says , `` You look at the songs and there 's not a clunker in the group . In fact , Frank Rich described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991 . The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairytales . Take that vision , put it into a new medium , make it a radical reinvention , something not just for the stage because it 's not just being literal , now other elements come into play . It 's not just having real actors do it '' . </P> <P> Condon initially prepared on only drawing inspiration from the original film , but he also planned to include most of the songs composed by Alan Menken , Howard Ashman and Tim Rice from the Broadway musical , with the intention of making the film as a `` straight - forward , live - action , large - budget movie musical '' . Menken returned to score the film 's music , which features songs from the original film by him and Howard Ashman , plus new material written by Menken and Tim Rice . Menken said the film will not include songs that were written for the Broadway musical and instead , created four new songs . However , an instrumental version of the song `` Home '' , which was written for the musical , is used during the scene where Belle first enters her room in the castle . </P> <P> On January 19 , 2017 , it was confirmed by both Disney and C\u00e9line Dion - singer of the original 1991 Beauty and the Beast duet song , with singer Peabo Bryson - that Dion would be performing one of the new original songs `` How Does a Moment Last Forever '' to play over the end titles . She originally had doubts about whether or not to record the song due to the recent death of her husband and manager Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil , who had previously helped her secure the 1991 pop duet . While ultimately accepting the opportunity , she said : `` ( The ) first Beauty and the Beast decision was made with my husband . Now I 'm making decisions on my own . It 's a little bit harder . I could n't say yes right away , because I felt like I was kind of cheating in a way ''. ( 18 ) She eventually felt compelled to record the song because of the impact Beauty and the Beast has had on her career . According to Dion , `` I was at the beginning of my career , it put me on the map , it put me where I am today ''. ( 9 ) Also , Josh Groban was announced to be performing the new original song `` Evermore '' on January 26 , 2017 . </P> <P> The 2017 film features a remake of the 1991 original song Beauty and the Beast recorded as a duet by Ariana Grande and John Legend . Grande and Legend 's updated version of the Beauty and the Beast title song is faithful to the original , Grammy - winning duet , performed by C\u00e9line Dion and Peabo Bryson for the 1991 Disney classic . </P> <P> Emma Thompson also performed a rendition of `` Beauty and the Beast '' , which was performed by Angela Lansbury in the original 1991 animated film release . </P> <P> Disney debuted the music video for Ariana Grande and John Legend 's interpretation of the title song `` Beauty and the Beast '' on Freeform television network on March 5 , 2017 , and it has since attained over 100 million video views on the Vevo video hosting service . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> On March 16 , 2015 , Disney announced the film would be released in 3D on March 17 , 2017 . The first official presentation of the film took place at Disney 's three - day D23 Expo in August 2015 . </P> <P> The world premiere of Beauty and the Beast took place on February 23 , 2017 , at Spencer House in London , England ; and the film later premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood , California , on March 2 , 2017 . The stream was broadcast onto YouTube . </P> <P> A sing along version of the film released in over 1,200 US theaters nationwide on April 7 , 2017 . The United Kingdom received the same version on April 21 , 2017 . </P> <H3> Marketing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disney spent around $140 million for marketing the film worldwide . Following an announcement on May 22 , 2016 , Disney premiered the first official teaser trailer on Good Morning America the next day . In its first 24 hours , the teaser trailer reached 91.8 million views , which topped the number of views seen in that amount of time in history , including for the teasers for other films distributed by Disney such as Avengers : Age of Ultron , Star Wars : The Force Awakens and Captain America : Civil War . This record has since been broken by Thor : Ragnarok and It . The first official teaser poster was released on July 7 , 2016 . On November 2 , 2016 , Entertainment Weekly debuted the first official image on the cover of their magazine for the week along with nine new photos as well . One week later , Emma Watson and Disney debuted a new poster for the film . On November 14 , 2016 , the first theatrical trailer was released again on Good Morning America . The trailer reached 127.6 million views in its first 24 hours , setting a new record as the trailer with the most views in one day , beating out Fifty Shades Darker . This record has since been broken again by The Fate of the Furious . A TV spot with Watson singing was shown during the 74th Golden Globe Awards . Disney released the final trailer on January 30 , 2017 . </P> <H3> Home Media ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beauty and the Beast was released on Blu - ray , DVD and Digital HD on June 6 , 2017 . The film debuted at No. 1 on the NPD VideoScan overall disc sales chart , with all other titles in the top 20 , collectively , selling only 40 % as many units as Beauty and the Beast . The movie regained the top spot on the national home video sales charts during its third week of release . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> Praised for her performance as Belle worldwide , Beauty and the Beast is Emma Watson 's second highest - grossing film , behind only the final Harry Potter film , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 . <P> Beauty and the Beast grossed $504 million in the United States and Canada and $758.6 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $1.262 billion . With a production budget of $160 million , it is the second-most expensive musical ever made ; only Hello , Dolly ! ( 1969 ) with a budget of $25 million ( $165 million in 2016 dollars ) cost more . In just ten days , it became the highest - grossing live - action musical of all time , beating the nine - year - old record held by Mamma Mia ! . It is currently the second biggest musical ever overall , behind Disney 's Frozen ( 2013 ) . Worldwide , the film proved to be a global phenomenon , earning a total of $357 million over its four - day opening weekend from 56 markets . Critics said the film was playing like superhero movies amongst women . It was the second biggest March global opening , behind only Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , the thirteenth - biggest worldwide opening ever and the seventh - biggest for Disney . This includes $21 million from IMAX plays on 1,026 screens , a new record for an IMAX PG title . It surpassed the entire lifetime total of the original film in just six days . </P> <P> Beauty and the Beast is the 300th digitally remastered release in IMAX company 's history , which began with the re-release of Apollo 13 in 2002 . Its robust global debut helped push the company past $6 billion for the first time , and led to analysts believing that the film had a shot of passing $1 billion worldwide from theatrical earnings . On April 12 , it passed the $1 billion threshold , becoming the first film of 2017 , the fourteenth Disney film , and the twenty - ninth film overall to pass the mark . It became the first film since Rogue One ( also a Disney property ) in December 2016 to make over a billion dollars , and did so on its twenty - ninth day of release . It is currently the highest - grossing film of 2017 , the highest - grossing March release , the highest - grossing remake of all - time , and the fifth biggest Disney film . Even after inflation adjusted , it is still ahead of the $425 million gross ( $760 million in 2017 dollars ) of the original film . </P> North America ( edit ) <P> In the United States and Canada , Beauty and the Beast topped Fandango 's pre-sales and became the fastest - selling family film in the company 's history , topping the studio 's own animated film Finding Dory released the previous year . Early tracking had the film grossing around $100 million in its opening weekend , with some publications predicting it could reach $130 million . By the time the film 's release was 10 days away , analysts raised projections to as high as $150 million . It earned $16.3 milion from Thursday previews night , marking the biggest of 2017 ( breaking Logan 's record ) , the biggest ever for a Disney live - action film ( breaking Maleficent 's record ) , the second biggest ever for both a G or PG - rated film ( behind the sixth Harry Potter film Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince which also starred Watson ) , and the third biggest ever in the month of March ( behind Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice and The Hunger Games ) . An estimated 41 % of the gross came from IMAX , 3D and premium large format screenings which began at 6 pm , while the rest -- 59 % -- came from regular 2D shows which began at 7 p.m. The numbers were considered more impressive given that the film played during a school week . </P> <P> On its opening day , the film made $63.8 million from 4,210 theaters across 9,200 screens , marking the third biggest in the month of March , trailing behind Batman v Superman ( $81.5 million ) and The Hunger Games ( $67 million ) . It was also the biggest opening day ever for a film that was n't PG - 13 , displacing the $58 million opening Wednesday of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince . Its opening day alone ( which includes Thursday 's previews ) almost matched the entire opening weekend of previous Disney live - action films , Maleficent ( $69.4 million ) and Cinderella ( $67.9 million ) . Unlike all previous four Disney live - action films witnessing a hike on their second day , Saturday , Beauty and the Beast actually fell - 2 % , but nevertheless , the dip was paltry , and the grosses are so much bigger compared to the other titles . Earning a total of $174.8 million on its opening weekend , it defied all expectations and went on to set numerous notable records . This includes the biggest opening of the year as well as the biggest for the month of March and pre-summer / spring opening , beating Batman v Superman , the biggest start ever for a PG title ( also for a family film ) , surpassing Finding Dory , the biggest debut of all time for a female - fueled film , ahead of The Hunger Games : Catching Fire , the biggest for a Disney live - action adaptation , ahead of Alice in Wonderland and the biggest musical debut ever , supplanting Pitch Perfect 2 . Furthermore , it is also Watson 's highest - opening , beating Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 same with Emma Thompson , director Bill Condon 's biggest debut ever ahead of The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 and the biggest outside of summer , save for Star Wars : The Force Awakens , not accounting for inflation . </P> <P> It became the forty - third film to debut with over $100 million and the fifteenth film to open above $150 million . Its three - day opening alone surpassed the entire original North American run of the first film ( $146 million ; before the 3D re-release ) , instantly becoming the second biggest film of the year , behind Logan ( $184 million ) , and also the second highest - grossing musical , behind Grease 's $188 million cumulative gross in 1978 . 70 % of the total ticket sales came from 2D showings signifying that people who do n't go to theaters frequently came out in bulk to watch the film . About 26 % of the remaining tickets were for 3D . IMAX accounted for 7 % ( $12.5 million ) of the total weekend 's gross , setting a new record for a PG title , ahead of Alice in Wonderland ( $12.1 million ) while PLF repped 11 % of the box office . 70 % of the film 's opening day demographic was female , dropping to 60 % through the weekend . According polling service PostTrak , about 84 percent of American parents who saw the film on its opening day said they would `` definitely '' recommend it for families . The film 's opening was credited to positive word of mouth from audiences , good reviews from critics , effective marketing which sold the title not just as a family film but also as a romantic drama , the cast 's star power ( especially Emma Watson ) , lack of competition , being the first family film since The Lego Batman Movie a month earlier , nostalgia , and the success and ubiquity of the first film and Disney 's brand . </P> <P> On Monday , its fourth day of release , the film fell precipitously by 72 % earning $13.5 million . The steep fall was due to a limited marketplace where only 11 % K - 12 and 15 % colleges were off per ComScore . Nevertheless , it is the second biggest March Monday , behind Batman v Superman ( $15 million ) . This was followed by the biggest March and pre-summer Tuesday with $17.8 million , a + 32 % increase from its previous day . The same day , the film passed $200 million in ticket sales . It earned $228.6 million in the first week of release , the sixth - biggest seven - day gross of all time . In its second weekend , the film continued to maintain the top positioning and fell gradually by 48 % earning another $90.4 million to register the fourth - biggest second weekend of all time , and the third - biggest for Disney . In terms of percentage drop , its 48 % decline is the third - smallest drop for any film opening above $125 million ( behind Finding Dory and The Force Awakens ) . The hold was notable considering how the film was able to fend off three new wide release ; Power Rangers , Life , and CHiPs . As a result , it passed the $300 million threshold becoming the first film of 2017 the pass said mark . The film grossed $45.4 million in its third weekend , finally being overtaken for the top spot by newcomer The Boss Baby ( $50.2 million ) . On April 4 , 2017 , its nineteenth day of release , it passed the $400 million threshold becoming the first film of 2017 to do so . By its fourth weekend , the film began was playing in 3,969 cinemas , a fall of 241 theaters from its previous weekend . Of those , approximately 1,200 cinemas were sing - along versions . It earned $26.3 million ( - 48 % ) and retained second place . By comparison , previous Disney films Moana ( \u2212 8 % ) and Frozen ( \u2212 2 % ) both witnessed mild percentage declines the weekend their sing - alone versions were released . Its seventh weekend of release was in contemporaneous with another Emma Watson - starring new film The Circle . That weekend , The Circle was number four , while Beauty and the Beast was at number six . By May 28 , the film had earned over $500 million in ticket sales becoming the first ( and currently only ) film of 2017 , the third female - fueled film ( after The Force Awakens and Rogue One : A Star Wars Story followed by Wonder Woman ) and the eighth overall film in cinematic history to pass the mark . </P> <P> It has already become the biggest March release , dethroning The Hunger Games ( 2012 ) , the biggest musical film ( both animated and live - action ) , as well as the biggest film of 2017 . </P> Outside North America ( edit ) <P> Internationally , the film began playing on Thursday , March 16 , 2017 . Through Sunday , March 19 , it had a total international opening of $182.3 million from 55 markets , 44 of which were major territories , far exceeding initial estimations of $100 million and opened at No. 1 in virtually all markets except Vietnam , Turkey , and India . Its launch is the second biggest for the month of March , behind Batman v Superman ( $256.5 million ) . In IMAX , it recorded the biggest debut for a PG title ( although it carried varying certificate amongst different markets ) with $8.5 million from 649 screens , the second biggest for a PG title behind The Jungle Book . In its second weekend , it fell just by - 35 % earning another $120.6 million and maintaining its first position hold . It added major markets like France and Australia . It top the international box office for three consecutive weekends before finally being dethroned by Ghost in the Shell and The Boss Baby in its fourth weekend . Despite the fall , the film helped Disney push past the $1 billion thresold internationally for the first time in 2017 . </P> <P> It scored the biggest opening day of the year in Hong Kong and the Philippines , the biggest March Thursday in Italy ( $1 million , also the biggest Disney Thursday debut ) , the biggest March opening day in Austria , and the second biggest in Germany ( $1.1 million ) , Disney 's biggest March in Denmark , the biggest Disney live - action debut in China ( $12.6 million ) , the UK ( $6.2 million ) , Mexico ( $2.4 million ) and Brazil ( $1.8 million ) and the third biggest in South Korea with $1.2 million , behind only Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End and Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides . In terms of opening weekend , the largest debut came from China ( $44.8 million ) , followed by the UK ( $24.3 million ) , Korea ( $11.8 million ) , Mexico ( $11.8 million ) , Australia ( $11.1 million ) , Brazil ( $11 million ) , Germany ( $10.7 million ) , France ( $8.4 million ) , Italy ( $7.6 million ) , Philippines ( $6.3 million ) , Russia ( $6 million ) and Spain ( $5.8 million ) . </P> <P> In the United Kingdom and Ireland , the film recorded the biggest opening ever for a PG film , the biggest Disney live - action opening of all time , the biggest March opening weekend , the biggest opening for a musical ( ahead of 2012 's Les Mis\u00e9rables ) , the number one opening of 2017 to date and the fifth - biggest ever overall with \u00a3 19.7 million ( $24.5 million ) from 639 theatres and almost twice that of The Jungle Book ( \u00a3 9.9 million ) . This included the second biggest Saturday ever ( \u00a3 7.9 million ) , only behind Star Wars : The Force Awakens . It witnessed a decline in its second weekend , earning \u00a3 12.33 million ( $15.4 million ) . Though the film was falling at a faster rate than The Jungle Book , it had already surpassed the said film and its second weekend is the third biggest ever ( behind the two James Bond films Skyfall ( 2012 ) and Spectre ) . In India , despite facing heavy competitions from four new Hindi releases , two Tamils films and a Malayalam and a Punjabi release , the film managed to take an occupancy of 15 % on its opening day , an impressive feat despite tremendous competitions . It earned around \u20b9 1.5 crore ( US $230,000 ) nett on its opening day from an estimated 600 screens which is more than the three Hindi releases -- Machine , Trapped and Aa Gaya Hero -- combined . Disney reported a total of \u20b9 9.26 crore ( US $1.4 million ) gross for its opening weekend there . It was ahead of all new releases and second overall behind Bollywood film Badrinath Ki Dulhania . In Russia , despite receiving a restrictive 16 rating , the film managed to deliver a very successful opening with $6 million . </P> <P> In China , expectations were high for the film . The release date was announced on January 24 , giving Disney and local distributor China Film Group Corporation ample time -- around two months -- to market the film nationwide . The release date was strategically chosen to coincide with White Day . Preliminary reports suggested that it could open to $40 -- 60 million in its opening weekend . Largely driven by young women , its opening day pre-sales outpaced that of The Jungle Book . The original film was however never widely popular in the country . Although China has occasionally blocked gay - themed content from streaming video services , in this case , Chinese censors decided to leave the gay scene intact . According to local box office tracker Ent Group , the film grossed an estimated $12.1 million on its opening day ( Friday ) , representing 70 % of the total receipts . Including previews , it made a total of $14.5 million from 100,000 screenings , which is 43 % of all screenings in the country . It climbed to $18.5 million on Saturday ( 102,700 showings ) for a three - day total of $42.6 million , securing 60 % of the total marketplace . Disney on the other hand reported a different figure of $44.8 million . Either ways , it recorded the second biggest opening for a Disney live - action film , with $3.4 million coming from 386 IMAX screens . Japan -- a huge Disney market -- served as the film 's final market and opened there on April 21 It debuted with a better - than - expected $12.5 million on its opening weekend helping the film push past the $1.1 billion threshold . An estimated $1.1 million came from IMAX screenings , the fourth - biggest ever in the country . The two day gross was $9.7 million , outstripping Frozen 's previous record of $9.5 million . Due to positive reviews , good word - of - mouth and benefitting from the Golden Week , the film saw a 9 % increase on its second weekend . The hold was strong enough to fend off newcomer The Fate of the Furious from securing the top spot . The total there is now over $98 million after seven weekends and is the biggest film release of the year and overall the eleventh biggest of all time . It topped the box office there for eight consecutive weekends . </P> <P> The only markets where the film did not top the weekend charts were Vietnam ( behind Kong : Skull Island ) , Turkey ( with two local movies and Logan ahead ) and India ( where Badrinath Ki Dulhania retained No. 1 ) . It topped the box office for four straight weekends in Germany , Korea , Austria , Finland , Poland , Portugal , Brazil , Venezuela , Bolivia , Switzerland and the UK ( exclusive of previews ) . In the Philippines , it emerged as the most commercial successful film of all time -- both local and foreign -- with over $13.5 million . In just five weeks , the film became one of the top 10 highest - grossing film of all time in the United Kingdom and Ireland , ahead of all but one Harry Potter film ( Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 ) and all three The Lord of the Rings movies ( which also starred Ian McKellen ) . It is currently the eighth biggest grosser with \u00a3 70.1 million ( $90 million ) , overtaking Mamma Mia ! to become the biggest musical production ever there . The biggest international earning markets following the UK are Japan ( $108 million ) , China ( $85.8 million ) , Brazil ( $41.5 million ) , Korea ( $37.5 million ) , and Australia ( $35 million ) . In Europe alone , the cumulative total is $267 million to become the second - highest - grossing film in the past 1 year ( behind Rogue One : A Star Wars Story ) . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beauty and the Beast received generally positive reviews , with praise for the faithfulness to the original film with a few elements of the Broadway musical version , cast performances , visuals , Jacqueline Durran 's costume designs , Alan Menken 's musical score and songs , though the designs of the Beast and the servants ' household object forms received mixed reviews . On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 70 % based on 291 reviews , with an average rating of 6.6 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` With an enchanting cast , beautifully crafted songs , and a painterly eye for detail , Beauty and the Beast offers a faithful yet fresh retelling that honors its beloved source material . '' On Metacritic , the film has a score of 65 out of 100 , based on 47 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . In CinemaScore polls , audiences gave the film an average grade of `` A '' on an A+ to F scale . </P> <P> Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote : `` It 's a Michelin - triple - starred master class in patisserie skills that transforms the cinematic equivalent of a sugar rush into a kind of crystal - meth - like narcotic high that lasts about two hours . '' Felperin also praised the performances of Watson and Kline as well the special effects , costume designs and the sets while commended the inclusion of Gad 's character of LeFou as the first LGBT character in Disney . Owen Gleiberman of Variety , in his positive review of the film , wrote : `` It 's a lovingly crafted movie , and in many ways a good one , but before that it 's an enraptured piece of old - is - new nostalgia . '' Gleiberman compared Steven 's character of the Beast to a royal version of the titular character in The Elephant Man and the 1946 version of the Beast in Jean Cocteau 's original adaptation . A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised the performances of both Watson and Stevens , and wrote : `` It looks good , moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste . I almost did n't recognize the flavor : I think the name for it is joy . '' Likewise , The Washington Post 's Ann Hornaday complimented Watson 's performance , describing it as `` alert and solemn '' while noting her singing ability as `` serviceable enough to get the job done '' . Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun - Times awarded the film three and a half stars , lauded the performances of Watson and Thompson which he drew a comparison to Paige O'Hara 's and Angela Lansbury 's performances in the 1991 animated version while appreciating the performances of the other cast and also pointing out on its usage of the combination of motion capture and CGI technology as a big advantage which he stated : `` Almost overwhelmingly lavish , beautifully staged and performed with exquisite timing and grace by the outstanding cast '' . Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the cast , production design and the new songs while noting the film does n't try anything different , saying : `` There 's certainly nothing that new about this version of Beauty and the Beast ( well , except it is n't a cartoon anymore ) , but it 's a good recreation of a classic animated film that should leave most die - hards satisfied . '' In her A - review , Nancy Churnin of The Dallas Morning News praised the film 's emotional and thematic depth : `` There 's an emotional authenticity in director Bill Condon 's live - action Beauty and the Beast film that helps you rediscover Disney 's beloved 1991 animated film and 1994 stage show in fresh , stirring ways . '' </P> <P> Brian Truitt of USA Today commended the performances of Evans , Gad , McGregor and Thompson alongside Condon 's affinity with musicals , the production design , visual effects featured in some of the song numbers including new songs made by the composers Alan Menken and Tim Rice , particularly Evermore which he described the new song with a potential for an Academy Award for Best Original Song . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three out of four stars which he deemed it as an `` exhilarating gift '' while he remarked that `` Beauty and the Beast does justice to Disney 's animated classic , even if some of the magic is M.I.A ( Missing in Action ) . '' Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine gave a positive review with a description as `` Wild , Vivid and Crazy - Beautiful '' as she wrote `` Nearly everything about Beauty and the Beast is larger than life , to the point that watching it can be a little overwhelming . '' and added that `` it 's loaded with feeling , almost like a brash interpretive dance expressing the passion and elation little girls ( and some boys , too ) must have felt upon seeing the earlier version . '' The San Francisco Chronicle 's Mick LaSalle struck an affirmative tone , calling it one of the joys of 2017 , stating that `` Beauty and the Beast creates an air of enchantment from its first moments , one that lingers and builds and takes on qualities of warmth and generosity as it goes along '' while referring the film as `` beautiful '' and also praised the film for its emotional and psychological tone as well Steven 's motion capture performance . Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph gave the film four stars out of five and wrote that `` It dazzles on this chocolate box of a picture that feels almost greedy yet to make this film work , down to a sugar - rush finale to grasp the nettle and make an out - an - out , bells - and - whistles musical '' while he praised the performances of Watson , McKellen , Thompson , McGregor , Evans and Gad . Mark Hughes of Forbes also similarly praised the film which he wrote that `` it could revive the story in a faithful but entirely new and unique way elevating the material beyond expectations , establishing itself as a cinematic equal to the original '' and also complimented the importance of undertaking a renowned yet problematic masterpiece as well addressing changes in the elements of the story while acknowledging the film 's effectiveness in resonating to the audiences . </P> <P> Several critics regarded the film as inferior to its 1991 animated predecessor . David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the 2017 film `` feels particularly egregious , in part , because it 's so slavishly devoted to the original ; every time it falls short of its predecessor ( which is quite often ) , it 's hard not to notice '' . Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said that the 2017 film `` takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted . It zips from one number to another , throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen , charmlessly . '' Phillips wrote that the film featured some `` less conspicuously talented '' performers who are `` stuck doing karaoke , or motion - capture work of middling quality '' , though he praised Kline 's performance as the `` best , sweetest thing in the movie ; he brings a sense of calm , droll authority '' . Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised Watson 's performance and wrote that the film was `` lit in that fascinatingly artificial honey - glow light , and it runs smoothly on rails -- the kind of rails that bring in and out the stage sets for the lucrative Broadway touring version . '' In the same newspaper , Wendy Ide criticized the film as `` ornate to the point of desperation '' in its attempt to emulate the animated film . </P> <P> Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B - , writing that while the film looks `` exceptionally great '' , he sensed that the new songs were `` not transporting '' . He felt the film needed more life and depth , but praised Watson 's and Steven 's performances as the `` film 's stronger elements '' . Dana Schwartz of the Observer felt that some of the characters , such as Gaston and the Beast , had been watered down from the 1991 film , and that the additional backstory elements failed to `` advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way '' while adding considerable bloat . Schwartz considered the singing of the cast to be adequate but felt that their voices should have been dubbed over , especially for the complex songs . </P> <H2> Accolades ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Date of ceremony </Th> <Th> Category </Th> <Th> Recipient ( s ) and nominee ( s ) </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> MTV Movie & TV Awards </Td> <Td> May 7 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Movie of the Year </Td> <Td> Beauty and the Beast </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Actor in a Movie </Td> <Td> Emma Watson </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Kiss </Td> <Td> Emma Watson and Dan Stevens </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Duo </Td> <Td> Josh Gad and Luke Evans </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Golden Trailer Awards </Td> <Td> June 6 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Best Animation / Family </Td> <Td> Beauty and the Beast </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Original Score </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Animation / Family TV Spot </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Fantasy Adventure TV Spot </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Teen Choice Awards </Td> <Td> August 13 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Choice Movie : Fantasy </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Movie : Fantasy Actor </Td> <Td> Dan Stevens </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Movie : Fantasy Actress </Td> <Td> Emma Watson </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Movie Villain </Td> <Td> Luke Evans </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Movie Ship </Td> <Td> Emma Watson and Dan Stevens </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Liplock </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Scene Stealer </Td> <Td> Josh Gad </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Hissy Fit </Td> <Td> Luke Evans </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dan Stevens </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Controversies ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Gay character ( edit ) </H3> <P> Controversy erupted after director Bill Condon said there was a `` gay moment '' in the film , when LeFou briefly waltzes with Stanley , one of Gaston 's friends . Afterwards in an interview with Vulture.com , Condon stated , `` Can I just say , I 'm sort of sick of this . Because you 've seen the movie -- it 's such a tiny thing , and it 's been overblown . '' Condon also added that Beauty and the Beast features much more diversity than just the highly - talked - about LeFou : `` That was so important . We have interracial couples -- this is a celebration of everybody 's individuality , and that 's what 's exciting about it . '' GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis praised the move stating , `` It is a small moment in the film , but it is a huge leap forward for the film industry . '' </P> <P> In Russia , Vitaly Milonov agitated the culture minister for banning the film , but instead it was given a 16 + rating ( children under the age of 16 can only be admitted to see it in theaters with accompanying adults ) . Additionally , a theater in Henagar , Alabama did not screen the film because of the subplot . In Malaysia , the Film Censorship Board insisted the `` gay moment '' scene be cut , prompting an indefinite postponement of its release by Disney , followed by their decision to withdraw it completely if it could not be released uncensored . The studio moved the release date to March 30 , to allow more time for Malaysia 's censor board to make a decision on whether or not to release the film without changes . The distributors and producers then submitted an appeal to the Film Appeal Committee of Malaysia , which allowed the film to be released without any cuts and a P13 rating on the grounds that the `` gay element '' was minor and did not affect the positive elements featured in the film . In Kuwait , the movie was withdrawn from cinemas by National Cinema Company which owns most of the cinemas in the country . A board member of the company stated that the Ministry of Information 's censorship department had requested it to stop its screening and edit it for things deemed offensive by it . </P> <P> There were also a number of boycotts against the film . A call to boycott on LifePetitions received over 129,000 signatures , while the American Family Association featured a petition to boycott with the film , asking the public to help crowdfund a CGI version of Pilgrim 's Progress instead . </P> <H3> Belle and the Beast 's relationship ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disney has sought to portray Belle as an empowered young woman , but a debate questioning whether it is possible to fall in love with someone who is holding you prisoner , and whether this is a problematic theme , has resulted . As was the case with the original animated film , one argument is that Belle suffers from Stockholm syndrome ( a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity ) . Emma Watson studied whether Belle is trapped in an abusive relationship with the Beast before signing on and concluded that she does not think the criticism fits this version of the folk tale . Watson described Stockholm Syndrome as `` where a prisoner will take on the characteristics of and fall in love with the captor . Belle actively argues and disagrees with ( Beast ) constantly . She has none of the characteristics of someone with Stockholm Syndrome because she keeps her independence , she keeps that freedom of thought '' , also adding that Belle defiantly `` gives as good as she gets '' before forming a friendship and romance with the Beast . </P> <P> Psychiatrist Frank Ochberg , who coined the term `` Stockholm syndrome '' , said he does not think Belle exhibits the trauma symptoms of prisoners suffering from the syndrome because she does not go through a period of feeling that she is going to die . Some therapists , while acknowledging that the pairing 's relationship does not meet the clinical definition of Stockholm syndrome , argue that the relationship depicted is dysfunctional and abusive and does not model healthy romantic relationships for young viewers . Constance Grady of Vox writes that Jeanne - Marie Leprince de Beaumont 's Beauty and the Beast was a fairy tale originally written to prepare young girls in 18th century France for arranged marriages , and that the power disparity is amplified in the Disney version . Anna Menta of Elite Daily argued that the Beast does not apologize to Belle for imprisoning , hurting , or manipulating her , and his treatment of Belle is not painted as wrong . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Beauty and the Beast at Box Office Mojo .

The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process , as weak so - called `` high - energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products . Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity . Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat . The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps , most of which are redox reactions themselves . Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions . </P> <P> Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar , amino acids and fatty acids , and the most common oxidizing agent ( electron acceptor ) is molecular oxygen ( O ) . The chemical energy stored in ATP ( its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form , thereby transferring energy for use by the cell ) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy , including biosynthesis , locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Aerobic respiration <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Aerobic respiration summed up </Li> <Li> 1.2 Glycolysis </Li> <Li> 1.3 Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate </Li> <Li> 1.4 Citric acid cycle </Li> <Li> 1.5 Oxidative phosphorylation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Efficiency of ATP production </Li> <Li> 3 Fermentation </Li> <Li> 4 Anaerobic respiration </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Aerobic respiration </H2> Aerobic respiration ( red arrows ) is the main means by which both fungi and animals utilize chemical energy in the form of organic compounds that were previously created through photosynthesis ( green arrow ) . <P> Aerobic respiration requires oxygen ( O ) in order to create ATP . Although carbohydrates , fats , and proteins are consumed as reactants , it is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown in glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle . The products of this process are carbon dioxide and water , but the energy transferred is used to break bonds in ADP as the third phosphate group is added to form ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) , by substrate - level phosphorylation , NADH and FADH </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Simplified reaction : </Td> <Td> C H O ( s ) + 6 O ( g ) \u2192 6 CO ( g ) + 6 H O ( l ) + heat </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> \u0394G = \u2212 2880 kJ per mol of C H O </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The negative \u0394G indicates that the reaction can occur spontaneously . </P> <P> The potential of NADH and FADH is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the `` terminal electron acceptor '' . Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation . This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane . This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group . Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration ( 2 from glycolysis , 2 from the Krebs cycle , and about 34 from the electron transport system ) . However , this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix , and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose . </P> <P> Aerobic metabolism is up to 15 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism ( which yields 2 molecules ATP per 1 molecule glucose ) . However some anaerobic organisms , such as methanogens are able to continue with anaerobic respiration , yielding more ATP by using other inorganic molecules ( not oxygen ) as final electron acceptors in the electron transport chain . They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation . The post-glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells , and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells . </P> <H3> Aerobic respiration summed up </H3> <P> 1 .

It then mixes with CO and makes 2 ATP , NADH , and FADH . From there the NADH and FADH go into the NADH reductase , which produces the enzyme . The NADH pulls the enzyme 's electrons to send through the electron transport chain . The electron transport chain pulls H ions through the chain . From the electron transport chain , the released hydrogen ions make ADP for an end result of 32 ATP . O attracts itself to the left over electron to make water . Lastly , ATP leaves through the ATP channel and out of the mitochondria . Main article : Glycolysis <P> Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytosol of cells in all living organisms . This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen . In humans , aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate . In aerobic conditions , the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate ( pyruvic acid ) , generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP . Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced , however , two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase . The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity ( decrease its stability ) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase . During the pay - off phase of glycolysis , four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate - level phosphorylation to make four ATP , and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate are oxidized . The overall reaction can be expressed this way : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Glucose + 2 NAD + 2 P + 2 ADP \u2192 2 pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 ATP + 2 H + 2 H O + heat </Dd> </Dl> <P> Starting with glucose , 1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6 - phosphate . Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6 - phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase . During energy metabolism , glucose 6 - phosphate becomes fructose 6 - phosphate . An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6 - phosphate into fructose 1 , 6 - disphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase . Fructose 1 , 6 - diphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules with three carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate . </P> <P> Glycolysis can be literally translated as `` sugar splitting '' . </P> <H3> Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate </H3> Main article : Pyruvate decarboxylation <P> Pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl - CoA and CO by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( PDC ) . The PDC contains multiple copies of three enzymes and is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cytosol of prokaryotes . In the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - CoA , one molecule of NADH and one molecule of CO is formed . </P> <H3> Citric acid cycle </H3> Main article : Citric acid cycle <P> This is also called the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle . When oxygen is present , acetyl - CoA is produced from the pyruvate molecules created from glycolysis . Once acetyl - CoA is formed , aerobic or anaerobic respiration can occur . When oxygen is present , the mitochondria will undergo aerobic respiration which leads to the Krebs cycle . However , if oxygen is not present , fermentation of the pyruvate molecule will occur . In the presence of oxygen , when acetyl - CoA is produced , the molecule then enters the citric acid cycle ( Krebs cycle ) inside the mitochondrial matrix , and is oxidized to CO while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH . NADH can be used by the electron transport chain to create further ATP as part of oxidative phosphorylation . To fully oxidize the equivalent of one glucose molecule , two acetyl - CoA must be metabolized by the Krebs cycle . Two waste products , H O and CO , are created during this cycle . </P> <P> The citric acid cycle is an 8 - step process involving 18 different enzymes and co-enzymes . During the cycle , acetyl - CoA ( 2 carbons ) + oxaloacetate ( 4 carbons ) yields citrate ( 6 carbons ) , which is rearranged to a more reactive form called isocitrate ( 6 carbons ) . Isocitrate is modified to become \u03b1 - ketoglutarate ( 5 carbons ) , succinyl - CoA , succinate , fumarate , malate , and , finally , oxaloacetate . </P> <P> The net gain of high - energy compounds from one cycle is 3 NADH , 1 FADH , and 1 GTP ; the GTP may subsequently be used to produce ATP . Thus , the total yield from 1 glucose molecule ( 2 pyruvate molecules ) is 6 NADH , 2 FADH , and 2 ATP . </P> <H3> Oxidative phosphorylation </H3> Main articles : Oxidative phosphorylation , Electron transport chain , Electrochemical gradient , and ATP synthase <P> In eukaryotes , oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae . It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient ( chemiosmotic potential ) across the boundary of inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle . ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP . The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and , with the addition of two protons , water is formed . </P> <H2> Efficiency of ATP production </H2> <P> The table below describes the reactions involved when one glucose molecule is fully oxidized into carbon dioxide .

All are actively transported using carriers that utilize the stored energy in the proton electrochemical gradient . </P> <Ul> <Li> Pyruvate is taken up by a specific , low Km transporter to bring it into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex . </Li> <Li> The phosphate carrier ( PiC ) mediates the electroneutral exchange ( antiport ) of phosphate ( H PO ; P ) for OH or symport of phosphate and protons ( H ) across the inner membrane , and the driving force for moving phosphate ions into the mitochondria is the proton motive force . </Li> <Li> The ATP - ADP translocase ( also called adenine nucleotide translocase , ANT ) is an antiporter and exchanges ADP and ATP across the inner membrane . The driving force is due to the ATP ( \u2212 4 ) having a more negative charge than the ADP ( \u2212 3 ) , and thus it dissipates some of the electrical component of the proton electrochemical gradient . </Li> </Ul> <P> The outcome of these transport processes using the proton electrochemical gradient is that more than 3 H are needed to make 1 ATP . Obviously this reduces the theoretical efficiency of the whole process and the likely maximum is closer to 28 -- 30 ATP molecules . In practice the efficiency may be even lower because the inner membrane of the mitochondria is slightly leaky to protons . Other factors may also dissipate the proton gradient creating an apparently leaky mitochondria . An uncoupling protein known as thermogenin is expressed in some cell types and is a channel that can transport protons . When this protein is active in the inner membrane it short circuits the coupling between the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis . The potential energy from the proton gradient is not used to make ATP but generates heat . This is particularly important in brown fat thermogenesis of newborn and hibernating mammals . </P> Stoichiometry of aerobic respiration and most known fermentation types in eucaryotic cell . Numbers in circles indicate counts of carbon atoms in molecules , C6 is glucose C H O , C1 carbon dioxide CO . Mitochondrial outer membrane is omitted . <P> According to some of newer sources the ATP yield during aerobic respiration is not 36 -- 38 , but only about 30 -- 32 ATP molecules / 1 molecule of glucose , because : </P> <Ul> <Li> ATP : NADH + H and ATP : FADH ratios during the oxidative phosphorylation appear to be not 3 and 2 , but 2.5 and 1.5 respectively . Unlike in the substrate - level phosphorylation , the stoichiometry here is difficult to establish . <Ul> <Li> ATP synthase produces 1 ATP / 3 H. However the exchange of matrix ATP for cytosolic ADP and Pi ( antiport with OH or symport with H ) mediated by ATP -- ADP translocase and phosphate carrier consumes 1 H / 1 ATP as a result of regeneration of the transmembrane potential changed during this transfer , so the net ratio is 1 ATP : 4 H . </Li> <Li> The mitochondrial electron transport chain proton pump transfers across the inner membrane 10 H / 1 NADH + H ( 4 + 2 + 4 ) or 6 H / 1 FADH ( 2 + 4 ) . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> So the final stoichiometry is </Dd> <Dd> 1 NADH + H : 10 H : 10 / 4 ATP = 1 NADH + H : 2.5 ATP </Dd> <Dd> 1 FADH : 6 H : 6 / 4 ATP = 1 FADH : 1.5 ATP </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> ATP : NADH + H coming from glycolysis ratio during the oxidative phosphorylation is <Ul> <Li> 1.5 , as for FADH , if hydrogen atoms ( 2H + 2e ) are transferred from cytosolic NADH + H to mitochondrial FAD by the glycerol phosphate shuttle located in the inner mitochondrial membrane . </Li> <Li> 2.5 in case of malate - aspartate shuttle transferring hydrogen atoms from cytosolic NADH + H to mitochondrial NAD </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> So finally we have , per molecule of glucose </P> <Ul> <Li> Substrate - level phosphorylation : 2 ATP from glycolysis + 2 ATP ( directly GTP ) from Krebs cycle </Li> <Li> Oxidative phosphorylation <Ul> <Li> 2 NADH + H from glycolysis : 2 \u00d7 1.5 ATP ( if glycerol phosphate shuttle transfers hydrogen atoms ) or 2 \u00d7 2.5 ATP ( malate - aspartate shuttle ) </Li> <Li> 2 NADH + H from the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and 6 from Krebs cycle : 8 \u00d7 2.5 ATP </Li> <Li> 2 FADH from the Krebs cycle : 2 \u00d7 1.5 ATP </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> Altogether this gives 4 + 3 ( or 5 ) + 20 + 3 = 30 ( or 32 ) ATP per molecule of glucose </P> <P> The total ATP yield in ethanol or lactic acid fermentation is only 2 molecules coming from glycolysis , because pyruvate is not transferred to the mitochondrion and finally oxidized to the carbon dioxide ( CO ) , but reduced to ethanol or lactic acid in the cytoplasm . </P> <H2> Fermentation </H2> Main article : Fermentation <P> Without oxygen , pyruvate ( pyruvic acid ) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation . The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion , but remains in the cytoplasm , where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell . This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate . Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis . In the absence of oxygen , fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis . This waste product varies depending on the organism . In skeletal muscles , the waste product is lactic acid . This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation . In strenuous exercise , when energy demands exceed energy supply , the respiratory chain can not process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH . During anaerobic glycolysis , NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate . Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction . Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen . During recovery , when oxygen becomes available , NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP . In yeast , the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide . This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation . The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate - level phosphorylation , which does not require oxygen . </P> <P> Fermentation is less efficient at using the energy from glucose : only 2 ATP are produced per glucose , compared to the 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration . This is because the waste products of fermentation still contain chemical potential energy that can be released by oxidation . Ethanol , for example , can be burned in an internal combustion engine like gasoline . Glycolytic ATP , however , is created more quickly . For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment , they must increase the rate of the glycolytic reactions . For multicellular organisms , during short bursts of strenuous activity , muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration , so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted , as is the case in sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves , such as sprinting . </P> <H2> Anaerobic respiration </H2> Main article : Anaerobic respiration <P> Cellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidised in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor ( such as oxygen ) to produce large amounts of energy , to drive the bulk production of ATP . </P> <P> Anaerobic respiration is used by some microorganisms in which neither oxygen ( aerobic respiration ) nor pyruvate derivatives ( fermentation ) is the final electron acceptor . Rather , an inorganic acceptor such as sulfate or nitrate is used . Such organisms are typically found in unusual places such as underwater caves or near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Maintenance respiration : maintenance as a functional component of cellular respiration </Li> <Li> Pasteur point </Li> <Li> Respirometry : research tool to explore cellular respiration </Li> <Li> Tetrazolium chloride : cellular respiration indicator </Li> <Li> Complex 1 : NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductes </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Bailey , Regina . `` Cellular Respiration '' .

It pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France . Both sides were supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France , as well as by American Indian allies . At the start of the war , the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers , compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies . The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians . The European nations declared war on one another in 1756 following months of localized conflict , escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict . </P> <P> The name French and Indian War is used mainly in the United States . It refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists : the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them . The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois , Catawba , and Cherokee , and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq , and Algonquin , Lenape , Ojibwa , Ottawa , Shawnee , and Wyandot . </P> <P> British and other European historians use the term the Seven Years ' War , as do English - speaking Canadians . French Canadians call it La guerre de la Conqu\u00eate ( the War of the Conquest ) or ( rarely ) the Fourth Intercolonial War . </P> <P> Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies , from Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north . It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers called the Forks of the Ohio , and the site of the French Fort Duquesne within present - day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754 , during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22 - year - old George Washington ambushed a French patrol . </P> <P> In 1755 , six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock , the newly arrived British Army commander , and planned a four - way attack on the French . None succeeded , and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster ; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . British operations failed in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York during 1755 - 57 due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , effective Canadian scouts , French regular forces , and Indian warrior allies . In 1755 , the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia , and they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians ( 1755 -- 64 ) soon afterwards . Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley , Commander - in - Chief , North America , without direction from Great Britain . The Acadians were expelled , both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty . Indians likewise were driven off the land to make way for settlers from New England . </P> <P> The British colonial government fell in the region of modern Nova Scotia after several disastrous campaigns in 1757 , including a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry ; this last was followed by Indians torturing and massacring their British victims . William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces that they had in New France , preferring to concentrate their forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theater of the war . Between 1758 and 1760 , the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada ( part of New France ) . They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately the city of Quebec ( 1759 ) . The British later lost the Battle of Sainte - Foy west of Quebec ( 1760 ) , but the French ceded Canada in accordance with the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) . </P> <P> The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo - French conflict . France ceded to Great Britain its territory east of the Mississippi . It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River ( including New Orleans ) to its ally Spain in compensation for Spain 's loss to Britain of Florida . ( Spain had ceded Florida to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana , Cuba . ) France 's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , confirming Great Britain 's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 The origin of the name </Li> <Li> 2 North America in the 1750s </Li> <Li> 3 Events leading to war <Ul> <Li> 3.1 C\u00e9loron 's expedition </Li> <Li> 3.2 Negotiations </Li> <Li> 3.3 Attack on Pickawillany </Li> <Li> 3.4 French fort construction </Li> <Li> 3.5 Virginia 's response </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Course of the war <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Battle of Jumonville Glen </Li> <Li> 4.2 Albany Congress </Li> <Li> 4.3 British campaigns , 1755 </Li> <Li> 4.4 French victories , 1756 -- 1757 </Li> <Li> 4.5 British conquest , 1758 -- 1760 <Ul> <Li> 4.5. 1 1758 </Li> <Li> 4.5. 2 1759 -- 1760 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.6 End of the war </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Consequences </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 8 Further reading </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> The origin of the name </H2> <P> The conflict is known by multiple names . In British America , wars were often named after the sitting British monarch , such as King William 's War or Queen Anne 's War . There had already been a King George 's War in the 1740s during King George 's reign , so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents and it became known as the French and Indian War . This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States , but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years ' War , a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain . American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years ' War . Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire . </P> <P> In Europe , the North American theater of the Seven Years ' War usually is not given a separate name . The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years ' War . `` Seven Years '' refers to events in Europe , from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763 . These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America which was largely concluded in six years , from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760 . </P> <P> Canadians refer to both the European and North American conflicts as the Seven Years ' War ( Guerre de Sept Ans ) . French Canadians also use the term `` War of Conquest '' ( Guerre de la Conqu\u00eate ) , since it is the war in which Canada was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire . </P> <H2> North America in the 1750s </H2> Map showing the 1750 possessions of Britain ( pink ) , France ( blue ) , and Spain ( green ) in North America <P> At this time , North America east of the Mississippi River was largely claimed by either Great Britain or France . Large areas had no colonial settlements . The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley , with some also in Acadia ( present - day New Brunswick and parts of Nova Scotia ) , including \u00cele Royale ( present - day Cape Breton Island ) . Fewer lived in New Orleans , Biloxi , Mississippi , Mobile , Alabama , and small settlements in the Illinois Country , hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries . French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds , did business with local Indian tribes , and often married Indian women . Traders married daughters of chiefs , creating high - ranking unions . </P> <P> British settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1 with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north to Georgia in the south . Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west , as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time when their provincial charters were granted . Their population centers were along the coast , yet the settlements were growing into the interior . Nova Scotia had been captured from France in 1713 , and it still had a significant French - speaking population . Britain also claimed Rupert 's Land where the Hudson 's Bay Company traded for furs with local Indian tribes . </P> Iroquois engaging in trade with colonists , 1722 <P> In between the French and British colonists , large areas were dominated by Indian tribes . To the north , the Mi'kmaqs and the Abenakis were engaged in Father Le Loutre 's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia , Acadia , and the eastern portions of the province of Canada , as well as much of Maine . The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of Upstate New York and the Ohio Country , although Ohio also included Algonquian - speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee , as well as Iroquoian - speaking Mingos . These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule and were limited by them in their authority to make agreements . </P> <P> The Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan - speaking Catawbas , Muskogee - speaking Creeks and Choctaw , and the Iroquoian - speaking Cherokee tribes . When war broke out , the French colonists used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region , which was not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British ; these included the Hurons , Mississaugs , Ojibwas , Winnebagos , and Potawatomi . The British colonists were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations and also by the Cherokees , until differences sparked the Anglo - Cherokee War in 1758 . In 1758 , the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations . Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French , their primary trading partner and supplier of arms . The Creeks and Cherokees were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict . </P> <P> By this time , Spain claimed only the province of Florida in eastern North America ; it controlled Cuba and other territories in the West Indies that became military objectives in the Seven Years ' War . Florida 's European population was a few hundred , concentrated in St. Augustine and Pensacola . </P> New York and Pennsylvania theaters of the war , image from 1905 <P> At the start of the war , no French regular army troops were stationed in North America , and few British troops . New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine , companies of colonial regulars ( some of whom had significant woodland combat experience ) . The colonial government recruited militia support when needed . Most British colonies mustered local militia companies to deal with Indian threats , generally ill trained and available only for short periods , but they did not have any standing forces . Virginia , by contrast , had a large frontier with several companies of British regulars . </P> <P> The colonial governments were used to operating independently of one another and of the government in London , a situation that complicated negotiations with Indian tribes , whose territories often encompassed land claimed by multiple colonies . After the war began , the leaders of the British Army establishment tried to impose constraints and demands on the colonial administrations . </P> <H2> Events leading to War </H2> <H3> C\u00e9loron 's expedition </H3> <P> New France 's Governor - General Roland - Michel Barrin de La Galissoni\u00e8re was concerned about the incursion and expanding influence in the Ohio Country of British colonial traders such as George Croghan . In June 1747 , he ordered Pierre - Joseph C\u00e9loron to lead a military expedition through the area . Its objectives were : </P> <Ul> <Li> to reaffirm to New France 's Indian allies that their trading arrangements with colonists were exclusive to those authorized by New France </Li> <Li> to confirm Indian assistance in asserting and maintaining the French claim to the territories which French explorers had claimed </Li> <Li> to discourage any alliances between Britain and local Indian tribes </Li> <Li> to impress the Indians with a French show of force against British colonial settler incursion , unauthorized trading expeditions , and general trespass against French claims </Li> </Ul> <P> C\u00e9loron 's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians , and they covered about 3,000 miles ( 4,800 km ) between June and November 1749 . They went up the St. Lawrence , continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario , crossed the portage at Niagara , and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie . At the Chautauqua Portage near Barcelona , New York , the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River which it followed to the site of Pittsburgh . There C\u00e9loron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country . Whenever he encountered British colonial merchants or fur - traders , he informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave . </P> <P> C\u00e9loron 's expedition arrived at Logstown where the Indians in the area informed him that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British colonists regardless of the French . He continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany , the home of the Miami chief known as `` Old Briton '' . C\u00e9loron threatened Old Briton with severe consequences if he continued to trade with British colonists , but Old Briton ignored the warning . C\u00e9loron returned disappointedly to Montreal in November 1749 . </P> <P> C\u00e9loron wrote an extensively detailed report . `` All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French , '' he wrote , `` and are entirely devoted to the English . I do n't know in what way they could be brought back . '' Even before his return to Montreal , reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris , each side proposing that action be taken . Massachusetts governor William Shirley was particularly forceful , stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present . </P> <H3> Negotiations </H3> <P> In 1749 , the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country . The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory and construct a fort for their protection . But the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania , and both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims . In 1750 , Christopher Gist explored the Ohio territory , acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company , and he opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown . He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians agreed to terms through their `` Half - King '' Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative . These terms included permission to build a strong house at the mouth of the Monongahela River on the modern site of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . By the late 17th century , the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley , and they laid claim to it as their hunting ground by right of conquest . </P> <P> The War of the Austrian Succession ( better known as King George 's War ) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix - la - Chapelle which was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe . The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies were turned over to a commission , but it reached no decision . Frontier areas were claimed by both sides , from Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north to the Ohio Country in the south . The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean , where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland . </P> <H3> Attack on Pickawillany </H3> Main article : Raid on Pickawillany <P> Governor - General of New France Marquis de la Jonqui\u00e8re died on March 17 , 1752 , and he was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil . His permanent replacement was to be the Marquis Duquesne , but he did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post . The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade , an officer in the Troupes de la Marine . Langlade was given 300 men , including French - Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa tribe . His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following C\u00e9loron 's orders to cease trading with the British . On June 21 , the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany , capturing three traders and killing 14 Miami Indians , including Old Briton . He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some Indians in the expedition party . </P> <H3> French Fort construction </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

His orders were to protect the King 's land in the Ohio Valley from the British . Marin followed the route that C\u00e9loron had mapped out four years earlier . C\u00e9loron , however , had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates , whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts . He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie 's south shore near Erie , Pennsylvania , and he had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek . He then constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford , Pennsylvania ) , designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek . As he moved south , he drove off or captured British traders , alarming both the British and the Iroquois . Tanaghrisson was a chief of the Mingo Indians , who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion . He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and eating his father . He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action , which Marin contemptuously dismissed . </P> Robert Dinwiddie , British lieutenant governor of Virginia <P> The Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York , who was the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond . Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey , meaning `` he who does great things . '' He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area , and he was made a colonel of the Iroquois in 1746 ; he was later commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia . </P> <P> The Indian representatives and Johnson met with Governor Clinton and officials from some of the other American colonies at Albany , New York . Mohawk Chief Hendrick was the speaker of their tribal council , and he insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion . Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction , and Hendrick said that the `` Covenant Chain '' was broken , a long - standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown . </P> <H3> Virginia 's response </H3> <P> Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company which stood to lose money if the French held their claim . He ordered 21 year - old Major George Washington ( whose brother was another Ohio Company investor ) of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory in October 1753 . Washington left with a small party , picking up Jacob Van Braam as an interpreter , Christopher Gist ( a company surveyor working in the area ) , and a few Mingos led by Tanaghrisson . On December 12 , Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf . </P> <P> Jacques Legardeur de Saint - Pierre succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after Marin died on October 29 , and he invited Washington to dine with him . Over dinner , Washington presented Saint - Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country . Saint - Pierre said , `` As to the Summons you send me to retire , I do not think myself obliged to obey it . '' He told Washington that France 's claim to the region was superior to that of the British , since Ren\u00e9 - Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier . </P> Washington 's map of the Ohio River and surrounding region containing notes on French intentions , 1753 or 1754 <P> Washington 's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16 and arrived in Williamsburg on January 16 , 1754 . He stated in his report , `` The French had swept south '' , detailing the steps which they had taken to fortify the area , and their intention to fortify the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers . </P> <H2> Course of the War </H2> <P> Even before Washington returned , Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point where they began construction of a small stockaded fort in the early months of 1754 . Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude - Pierre Pecaudy de Contrec\u0153ur to relieve Saint - Pierre during the same period , and Contrec\u0153ur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5 , 1754 . These forces arrived at the fort on April 16 , but Contrec\u0153ur generously allowed Trent 's small company to withdraw . He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne . </P> <H3> Battle of Jumonville Glen </H3> <P> Dinwiddie had ordered Washington to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work , and Washington learned of Trent 's retreat while he was en route . Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British , so Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with him . He then learned of a French scouting party in the area , so he combined Tanaghrisson 's force with his own and surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen . They killed many of the Canadians , including their commanding officer Joseph Coulon de Jumonville , whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk . Historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people . They had been inclined to support the French , with whom they had long trading relationships . One of Tanaghrisson 's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire . </P> <P> Historians generally consider the Battle of Jumonville Glen as the opening battle of the French and Indian War in North America , and the start of hostilities in the Ohio valley . </P> The earliest authenticated portrait of George Washington shows him wearing his colonel 's uniform of the Virginia Regiment . This portrait was painted in 1772 by Charles Willson Peale . <P> Following the battle , Washington pulled back several miles and established Fort Necessity , which the Canadians attacked under the command of Jummonville 's brother at the Battle of Fort Necessity on July 3 . Washington surrendered and negotiated a withdrawal under arms . One of his men reported that the Canadian force was accompanied by Shawnee , Delaware , and Mingo warriors -- just those whom Tanaghrisson was seeking to influence . </P> <P> News of the two battles reached England in August . After several months of negotiations , the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French . They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition . Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock 's departure for North America . In response , King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755 . The British sent out their fleet in February 1755 , intending to blockade French ports , but the French fleet had already sailed . Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them . </P> <P> In a second British action , Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8 , 1755 , capturing her and two troop ships . The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755 , seizing ships and capturing seamen . These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756 . </P> <H3> Albany congress </H3> <P> An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July , 1754 . The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians , since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding . The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown . Nevertheless , the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence . </P> <H3> British campaigns , 1755 </H3> Locations of British campaigns , 1755 ( and other sites ) <P> The British formed an aggressive plan of operations for 1755 . General Braddock was to lead the expedition to Fort Duquesne , while Massachusetts governor William Shirley was given the task of fortifying Fort Oswego and attacking Fort Niagara , and Sir William Johnson was to capture Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric at present - day Crown Point , New York . Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton was to capture Fort Beaus\u00e9jour to the east , on the frontier between Nova Scotia and Acadia . </P> <P> Braddock led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne , with George Washington as one of his aides . The expedition was a disaster . It was attacked by French soldiers and Indian warriors ambushing them from up in trees and behind logs , and Braddock called for a retreat . He was killed and approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured . The remaining 500 British troops retreated to Virginia , led by George Washington . Two future opponents in the American Revolutionary War played key roles in organizing the retreat : Washington and Thomas Gage . </P> <P> The French acquired a copy of the British war plans , including the activities of Shirley and Johnson . Shirley 's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties , exacerbated by his inexperience in managing large expeditions . In conjunction , Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara . As a response , he left garrisons at Oswego , Fort Bull , and Fort Williams , the last two located on the Oneida Carry between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek at present - day Rome , New York . Supplies were cached at Fort Bull for use in the projected attack on Niagara . </P> William Johnson saving Baron Deskiau <P> Johnson 's expedition was better organized than Shirley 's , which was noticed by New France 's governor the Marquis de Vaudreuil . He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio , and he had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley 's expected attack . Vaudreuil saw Johnson as the larger threat and sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet that threat . Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River , but Johnson had strongly fortified it , and Dieskau 's Indian support was reluctant to attack . The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry . The battle ended inconclusively , with both sides withdrawing from the field . Johnson 's advance stopped at Fort William Henry , and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point , where they began the construction of Fort Carillon ( later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759 ) . </P> <P> Colonel Monckton captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour in June 1755 in the sole British success that year , cutting off the French fortress at Louisbourg from land - based reinforcements . To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg , Nova Scotia 's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French - speaking Acadian population from the area . Monckton 's forces , including companies of Rogers ' Rangers , forcibly removed thousands of Acadians , chasing down many who resisted and sometimes committing atrocities . More than any other factor , cutting off supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise . The Acadian resistance was sometimes quite stiff , in concert with Indian allies including the Mi'kmaq , with ongoing frontier raids against Dartmouth and Lunenburg , among others . The only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757 , other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians ranging around the Bay of Fundy , on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers , and \u00cele Saint - Jean . </P> <H3> French victories , 1756 -- 1757 </H3> See also : Franco - Indian alliance Conference between the French and Indian leaders around a ceremonial fire , by \u00c9mile Louis Vernier <P> Following the death of Braddock , William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America , and he laid out his plans for 1756 at a meeting in Albany in December 1755 . He proposed renewing the efforts to capture Niagara , Crown Point , and Duquesne , with attacks on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudi\u00e8re River to attack the city of Quebec . His plan , however , got bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others , including William Johnson and New York 's Governor Sir Charles Hardy , and consequently gained little support . </P> <P> Newcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun , with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command . Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers whom France sent to North America . French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756 , led by Major General Louis - Joseph de Montcalm and seconded by the Chevalier de L\u00e9vis and Colonel Fran\u00e7ois - Charles de Bourlamaque , all experienced veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession . On May 18 , 1756 , England formally declared war on France , which expanded the war into Europe and came to be known as the Seven Years ' War . </P> General Louis - Joseph de Montcalm <P> Governor Vaudreuil had ambitions to become the French commander in chief , in addition to his role as governor , and he acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived . Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain , so he ordered an attack against the forts which Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry . In the Battle of Fort Bull , French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies , including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder . They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario and endangered the Oswego garrison , already short on supplies . French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area , encouraging them to raid frontier settlements . This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers , with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action . </P> <P> The new British command was not in place until July . Abercrombie arrived in Albany but refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them , and Montcalm took bold action against his inertia . He built on Vaudreuil 's work harassing the Oswego garrison and executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga , as if to presage another attack along Lake George . With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany , Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August . In the aftermath , Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners ' personal effects . The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables , which angered the Indians . </P> Montcalm trying to stop allied Indians from the massacre of colonial soldiers and civilians as they leave after the Battle of Fort William Henry . <P> Loudoun was a capable administrator but a cautious field commander , and he planned one major operation for 1757 : an attack on New France 's capital of Quebec . He left a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm and began organizing for the expedition to Quebec . He was then ordered to attack Louisbourg first by William Pitt , the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies . The expedition was beset by delays of all kinds but was finally ready to sail from Halifax , Nova Scotia in early August . In the meantime , French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast , and a fleet awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg which outnumbered the British fleet . Faced with this strength , Loudoun returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry . </P> <P> French irregular forces ( Canadian scouts and Indians ) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757 . In January , they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga . In February , they launched a raid against the position across the frozen Lake George , destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification . In early August , Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort , which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole . When the withdrawal began , some of Montcalm 's Indian allies attacked the British column because they were angry about the lost opportunity for loot , killing and capturing several hundred men , women , children , and slaves . The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations , as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward . Modern writer William Nester believes that the Indians might have been exposed to European carriers , although no proof exists . </P> <H3> British Conquest , 1758 -- 1760 </H3> See also : Great Britain in the Seven Years ' War \u00a7 Conquest of Canada ( 1758 -- 60 ) The Victory of Montcalm 's Troops at Carillon by Henry Alexander Ogden . <P> Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 , as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping . The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757 , a difficult winter , and the allegedly corrupt machinations of Fran\u00e7ois Bigot , the intendant of the territory . His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates . A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758 . The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle ; yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing `` bad medicine '' as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry . </P> <P> Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence , with primary defenses at Carillon , Quebec , and Louisbourg , while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years . The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater and led to Newcastle 's fall from power along with the Duke of Cumberland , his principal military advisor . </P> <P> Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning . He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun . He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757 . Pitt 's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias , aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France . Two of the expeditions were successful , with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces . </P> 1758 Indians ambush British soldiers <P> The Forbes Expedition was a British campaign in September -- October 1758 , with 6,000 troops led by General John Forbes sent to drive out the French from the contested Ohio Country . The French withdrew from Fort Duquesne and left the British in control of the Ohio River Valley . The great French fortress at Louisbourg in Nova Scotia was captured after a siege . </P> <P> The third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon , in which 3,600 Frenchmen defeated Abercrombie 's force of 18,000 regulars , militia , and Indian allies outside the fort which the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga . Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac , including caches of supplies destined for New France 's western forts and furs destined for Europe . Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst , victor at Louisbourg . </P> Battle of Quebec , 13 September 1759 , painted by Captain Hervey Smyth <P> The French had generally poor results in 1758 in most theaters of the war . The new foreign minister was the duc de Choiseul , and he decided to focus on an invasion of Britain to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland . The invasion failed both militarily and politically , as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France and sent funds to Britain 's mainland ally of Prussia , while the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay . In one piece of good fortune , some French supply ships did manage to depart France and elude the British blockade of the French coast . </P> 1759 -- 1760 See also : Conquest of 1760 British General Jeffery Amherst <P> British victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 : the British captured Ticonderoga , James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders , and a British victory at Fort Niagara cut off the French frontier forts to the west and south . The victory was made complete in 1760 ; the British did suffer a defeat outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte - Foy , but they prevented the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides . </P> <P> Governor Vaudreuil in Montreal negotiated a capitulation with General Amherst in September 1760 . Amherst granted his requests that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition , to own property , and to remain undisturbed in their homes . The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers , and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war . </P> <H3> End of the War </H3> The descent of the French on St. John 's , Newfoundland , 1762 <P> Most of the fighting ended in continental North America in 1760 , although it continued in Europe between France and Britain . The notable exception was the French seizure of St. John 's , Newfoundland . General Amherst heard of this surprise action and immediately dispatched troops under his nephew William Amherst , who regained control of Newfoundland after the Battle of Signal Hill in September 1762 . Many troops from North America were reassigned to participate in further British actions in the West Indies , including the capture of Spanish Havana when Spain belatedly entered the conflict on the side of France , and a British expedition against French Martinique in 1762 led by Major General Robert Monckton . </P> <P> General Amherst also oversaw the transition of French forts to British control in the western lands . The policies which he introduced in those lands disturbed large numbers of Indians and contributed to Pontiac 's Rebellion in 1763 . This series of attacks on frontier forts and settlements required the continued deployment of British troops , and it was not resolved until 1766 . </P> Distribution of British military forces in 1766 <P> The war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763 , and war in the European theater was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763 . The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique , which had been occupied by the British . France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , along with fishing rights in the area . They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands ' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent . French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow . The British , however , were happy to take New France , as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue ; they also had ample places from which to obtain sugar . Spain traded Florida to Britain in order to regain Cuba , but they also gained Louisiana from France , including New Orleans , in compensation for their losses . Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations . </P> <H2> Consequences </H2> <P> The war changed economic , political , governmental , and social relations among the three European powers , their colonies , and the people who inhabited those territories . France and Britain both suffered financially because of the war , with significant long - term consequences . </P> Map showing British territorial gains following the Treaty of Paris in pink , and Spanish territorial gains after the Treaty of Fontainebleau in yellow <P> Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia , colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French - speaking Roman Catholic residents . The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 made land available to immigrants from Europe and migrants from the colonies to the south . The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces , but many went to France , and some went to New Orleans , which they had expected to remain French . Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands , but these efforts were unsuccessful . Others migrated to places such as Saint - Domingue or fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution . The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population . ( The French word `` Acadien '' changed to `` Cadien '' then to `` Cajun '' . ) </P> <P> Following the treaty , King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7 , 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory , and it continues to govern relations to some extent between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations . Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population , a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward - bound settlers . The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians . The Quebec Act addressed this and other issues in 1774 , raising concerns in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of `` popery . '' The Act maintained French Civil law , including the seigneurial system , a medieval code removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution . </P> The deportation order is read to a group of Acadians in 1755 <P> The Seven Years ' War nearly doubled Great Britain 's national debt . The Crown sought sources of revenue to pay it off and attempted to impose new taxes on its colonies . These attempts were met with increasingly stiff resistance , until troops were called in to enforce the Crown 's authority . These acts ultimately led to the start of the American Revolutionary War . </P> <P> France attached comparatively little value to its North American possessions , apart from the highly profitable sugar - producing Antilles islands which it retained . Minister Choiseul considered that he had made a good deal at the Treaty of Paris , and Voltaire wrote that Louis XV had lost `` a few acres of snow '' . For France , however , the military defeat and the financial burden of the war weakened the monarchy and contributed to the advent of the French Revolution in 1789 . </P> <P> For some of the Indian tribes , the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally , although other tribes were not so affected . The Ohio Country was now more available to colonial settlement , due to the construction of military roads by Braddock and Forbes . The Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769 , and it had modest repercussions . The British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of Indian tribes who did not want to do business with them . This migration also caused a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek , historic enemies who were now competing for land . The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave . Most went to Cuba , including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine , although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico . </P> <P> France returned to North America in 1778 with the establishment of a Franco - American alliance against Great Britain in the American War of Independence . This time , France succeeded in prevailing over Great Britain in what historian Alfred A. Cave describes as `` French ... revenge for Montcalm 's death '' . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> History of Canada portal </Li> <Li> New France portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> French and Indian Wars ( article includes King William 's War , Queen Anne 's War , King George 's War , and this war . ) </Li> <Li> Military history of Nova Scotia </Li> <Li> Northwest Indian War </Li> <Li> Franco - Indian alliance </Li> <Li> Great Britain in the Seven Years ' War </Li> <Li> New Hampshire Provincial Regiment </Li> <Li> American Indian Wars </Li> </Ul> <H2> Footnotes </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Brumwell , pp. 26 -- 31 , documents the starting sizes of the expeditions against Louisbourg , Carillon , Duquesne , and West Indies . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Brumwell , pp. 24 -- 25 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Gary Walton ; History of the American Economy ; page 27 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ M.

It forms the first part of the Constitution Act , 1982 . The Charter guarantees certain political rights to Canadian citizens and civil rights of everyone in Canada from the policies and actions of all areas and levels of the government . It is designed to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights . The Charter was signed into law by Queen Elizabeth II of Canada on April 17 , 1982 , along with the rest of the Act . </P> <P> The Charter was preceded by the Canadian Bill of Rights , which was enacted in 1960 . However , the Bill of Rights is only a federal statute , rather than a constitutional document . As a federal statute , it can be amended through the ordinary legislative process and has no application to provincial laws . The Supreme Court of Canada also narrowly interpreted the Bill of Rights and the Court was reluctant to declare laws inoperative . The relative ineffectiveness of the Canadian Bill of Rights motivated many to improve rights protections in Canada . The movement for human rights and freedoms that emerged after World War II also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The British Parliament formally enacted the Charter as a part of the Canada Act 1982 at the request of the Parliament of Canada in 1982 , the result of the efforts of the government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . </P> <P> One of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the scope of judicial review , because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights . The courts , when confronted with violations of Charter rights , have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations , as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism . The Charter , however , granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials . These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under a system of government that , influenced by Canada 's parent country the United Kingdom , was based upon Parliamentary supremacy . As a result , the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased judicial power . The Charter only applies to government laws and actions ( including the laws and actions of federal , provincial , and municipal governments and public school boards ) , and sometimes to the common law , not to private activity . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Features <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Exceptions </Li> <Li> 1.2 Fundamental freedoms </Li> <Li> 1.3 Democratic rights </Li> <Li> 1.4 Mobility rights </Li> <Li> 1.5 Legal rights </Li> <Li> 1.6 Equality rights </Li> <Li> 1.7 Language rights </Li> <Li> 1.8 Minority language education rights </Li> <Li> 1.9 Other sections </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 History </Li> <Li> 3 Interpretation and enforcement </Li> <Li> 4 Comparisons with other human rights documents </Li> <Li> 5 The Charter and national values </Li> <Li> 6 Criticism </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Features ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Part of the Constitution Act , 1982 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Preamble </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Guarantee of Rights and Freedoms </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Fundamental Freedoms </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Democratic Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3 , 4 , 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Mobility Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Legal Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Equality Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 15 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Official Languages of Canada </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 16 , 16.1 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Minority Language Education Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 23 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Enforcement </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 24 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> General </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Application of Charter </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 32 , 33 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Citation </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 34 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Under the Charter , people physically present in Canada have numerous civil and political rights . Most of the rights can be exercised by any legal person ( the Charter does not define the corporation as a `` legal person '' ) , but a few of the rights belong exclusively to natural persons , or ( as in sections 3 and 6 ) only to citizens of Canada . The rights are enforceable by the courts through section 24 of the Charter , which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied . This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the Charter and might damage the reputation of the justice system . Section 32 confirms that the Charter is binding on the federal government , the territories under its authority , and the provincial governments . The rights and freedoms enshrined in 34 sections of the Charter include : </P> <H3> Exceptions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Precluding all the freedoms and forming the basis of the Charter , the very first section , known as limitations clause , allows governments to justify certain infringements of Charter rights . Every case in which a court discovers a violation of the Charter would therefore require a section 1 analysis to determine if the law can still be upheld . Infringements are upheld if the purpose for the government action is to achieve what would be recognized as an urgent or important objective in a free society , and if the infringement can be `` demonstrably justified . '' Section 1 has thus been used to uphold laws against objectionable conduct such as hate speech ( e.g. , in R. v. Keegstra ) and obscenity ( e.g. , in R. v. Butler ) . Section 1 also confirms that the rights listed in the Charter are guaranteed . </P> <P> In addition , some of these rights are also subjected to the notwithstanding clause ( section 33 ) . The notwithstanding clause authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7 -- 15 for up to five years , subject to renewal . The Canadian federal government has never invoked it , and some have speculated that its use would be politically costly . In the past , the notwithstanding clause was invoked routinely by the province of Quebec ( which did not support the enactment of the Charter but is subject to it nonetheless ) . The provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta have also invoked the notwithstanding clause , to end a strike and to protect an exclusively heterosexual definition of marriage , respectively . ( Note that Alberta 's use of the notwithstanding clause is of no force or effect , since the definition of marriage is federal not provincial jurisdiction . ) The territory of Yukon also passed legislation once that invoked the notwithstanding clause , but the legislation was never proclaimed in force . </P> <H3> Fundamental Freedoms ( edit ) </H3> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 2 : which lists what the Charter calls `` fundamental freedoms '' namely freedom of conscience , freedom of religion , freedom of thought , freedom of belief , freedom of expression , freedom of the press and of other media of communication , freedom of peaceful assembly , and freedom of association . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Democratic rights ( edit ) </H3> <P> Generally , the right to participate in political activities and the right to a democratic form of government are protected : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 3 : the right to vote and to be eligible to serve as member of a legislature . </Dd> <Dd> Section 4 : the maximum duration of legislatures is set at five years . </Dd> <Dd> Section 5 : an annual sitting of legislatures is required as a minimum . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Mobility rights ( edit ) </H3> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 6 : protects the mobility rights of Canadian citizens which include the right to enter , remain in , and leave Canada .

Specifically , the language laws in the Charter include : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 16 : English and French are the official languages of Canada and New Brunswick . </Dd> <Dd> Section 16.1 : the English and French - speaking communities of New Brunswick have equal rights to educational and cultural institutions . </Dd> <Dd> Section 17 : the right to use either official language in Parliament or the New Brunswick legislature . </Dd> <Dd> Section 18 : the statutes and proceedings of Parliament and the New Brunswick legislature are to be printed in both official languages . </Dd> <Dd> Section 19 : both official languages may be used in federal and New Brunswick courts . </Dd> <Dd> Section 20 : the right to communicate with and be served by the federal and New Brunswick governments in either official language . </Dd> <Dd> Section 21 : other constitutional language rights outside the Charter regarding English and French are sustained . </Dd> <Dd> Section 22 : existing rights to use languages besides English and French are not affected by the fact that only English and French have language rights in the Charter .

These include , </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 25 : states that the Charter does not derogate existing Aboriginal rights and freedoms . Aboriginal rights , including treaty rights , receive more direct constitutional protection under section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . </Dd> <Dd> Section 26 : clarifies that other rights and freedoms in Canada are not invalidated by the Charter . </Dd> <Dd> Section 27 : requires the Charter to be interpreted in a multicultural context . </Dd> <Dd> Section 28 : states all Charter rights are guaranteed equally to men and women . </Dd> <Dd> Section 29 : confirms the rights of religious schools are preserved . </Dd> <Dd> Section 30 : clarifies the applicability of the Charter in the territories . </Dd> <Dd> Section 31 : confirms that the Charter does not extend the powers of legislatures . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <P> Finally , Section 34 : states that Part I of the Constitution Act , 1982 , containing the first 34 sections of the Act , may be collectively referred to as the `` Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms '' . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Printed copies of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms <P> Many of the rights and freedoms that are protected under the Charter , including the rights to freedom of speech , habeas corpus and the presumption of innocence , have their roots in a set of Canadian laws and legal precedents sometimes known as the Implied Bill of Rights . Many of these rights were also included in the Canadian Bill of Rights , which the Canadian Parliament enacted in 1960 . However , the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings . Unlike the Charter , it was an ordinary Act of Parliament , which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament , and it was applicable only to the federal government . The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of Rights conservatively , only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative . The Bill of Rights did not contain all of the rights that are now included in the Charter , omitting , for instance , the right to vote and freedom of movement within Canada . </P> <P> The centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 aroused greater interest within the government in constitutional reform . Said reforms would include improving safeguards of rights , as well as patriation of the Constitution , meaning the British Parliament would no longer have to approve constitutional amendments . Subsequently , Attorney General Pierre Trudeau appointed law professor Barry Strayer to research a potential bill of rights . While writing his report , Strayer consulted with a number of notable legal scholars , including Walter Tarnopolsky . Strayer 's report advocated a number of ideas that were later incorporated into the Charter , including protection for language rights . Strayer also advocated excluding economic rights . Finally , he recommended allowing for limits on rights . Such limits are included in the Charter 's limitation and notwithstanding clauses . In 1968 , Strayer was made the Director of the Constitutional Law Division of the Privy Council Office and in 1974 he became Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice . During those years , Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Trudeau , who had become Liberal leader and prime minister in 1968 , still very much wanted a constitutional bill of rights . The federal government and the provinces discussed creating one during negotiations for patriation , which resulted in the Victoria Charter in 1971 . This never came to be implemented . However , Trudeau continued with his efforts to patriate the Constitution , and promised constitutional change during the 1980 Quebec referendum . He would succeed in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act 1982 . This enacted the Constitution Act , 1982 . </P> <P> The inclusion of a charter of rights in the Constitution Act was a much - debated issue . Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980 , and announced his intention to constitutionalize a bill of rights that would include fundamental freedoms , democratic guarantees , freedom of movement , legal rights , equality and language rights . He did not want a notwithstanding clause . While his proposal gained popular support , provincial leaders opposed the potential limits on their powers . The federal Progressive Conservative opposition feared liberal bias among judges , should courts be called upon to enforce rights . Additionally , the British Parliament cited their right to uphold Canada 's old form of government . At a suggestion of the Conservatives , Trudeau 's government thus agreed to a committee of Senators and MPs to further examine the bill of rights as well as the patriation plan . During this time , 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone , all filmed for television , while civil rights experts and advocacy groups put forward their perceptions on the Charter 's flaws and omissions and how to remedy them . As Canada had a parliamentary system of government , and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past , it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the Charter , as Trudeau wanted . Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead . It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts . At the urging of civil libertarians , judges could even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of Charter rights in certain circumstances , something the Charter was not originally going to provide for . As the process continued , more features were added to the Charter , including equality rights for people with disabilities , more sex equality guarantees and recognition of Canada 's multiculturalism . The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on justifiability of limits in free societies ; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II . </P> Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was a major advocate of the Charter . <P> In its decision in the Patriation Reference ( 1981 ) , the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled there was a tradition that some provincial approval should be sought for constitutional reform . As the provinces still had doubts about the Charter 's merits , Trudeau was forced to accept the notwithstanding clause to allow governments to opt out of certain obligations . The notwithstanding clause was accepted as part of a deal called the Kitchen Accord , negotiated by the federal Attorney General Jean Chr\u00e9tien , Ontario 's justice minister Roy McMurtry and Saskatchewan 's justice minister Roy Romanow . Pressure from provincial governments ( which in Canada have jurisdiction over property ) and from the country 's left wing , especially the New Democratic Party , also prevented Trudeau from including any rights protecting private property . </P> <P> Nevertheless , Quebec did not support the Charter ( or the Canada Act 1982 ) , with `` conflicting interpretations '' as to why . The opposition could have owed to the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leadership being allegedly uncooperative , because it was more committed to gaining sovereignty for Quebec . It could have owed to Quebec leaders being excluded from the negotiation of the Kitchen Accord , which they saw as being too centralist . It could have owed to provincial leaders ' objections to the Accord 's provisions relating to the process of future constitutional amendment . They also opposed the inclusion of mobility rights and minority language education rights . The Charter is still applicable in Quebec because all provinces are bound by the Constitution . However , Quebec 's opposition to the 1982 patriation package has led to two failed attempts to amend the Constitution ( the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord ) which were designed primarily to obtain Quebec 's political approval of the Canadian constitutional order . </P> <P> While the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982 , it was not until 1985 that the main provisions regarding equality rights ( section 15 ) came into effect . The delay was meant to give the federal and provincial governments an opportunity to review pre-existing statutes and strike potentially unconstitutional inequalities . </P> <P> The typography of the physical document pictured here , and still distributed today , was typeset by Ottawa 's David Berman intentionally in Carl Dair 's Cartier typeface : at the time the most prominent Canadian typeface , having been commissioned by the Governor - General as a celebration of Canada 's centenary in 1967 . </P> <P> The Charter has been amended since its enactment . Section 25 was amended in 1983 to explicitly recognize more rights regarding Aboriginal land claims , and section 16.1 was added in 1993 . There have also been a number of unsuccessful attempts to amend the Charter , including the failed Charlottetown Accord of 1992 . The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required the Charter to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec 's distinct society , and would have added further statements to the Constitution Act , 1867 regarding racial and sexual equality and collective rights , and about minority language communities . Though the Accord was negotiated among many interest groups , the resulting provisions were so vague that Trudeau , then out of office , feared they would actually conflict with and undermine the Charter 's individual rights . He felt judicial review of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies of provincial governments , as governments would be given responsibility over linguistic minorities . Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the popular opposition to the Accord . </P> <H2> Interpretation and enforcement ( edit ) </H2> <P> The task of interpreting and enforcing the Charter falls to the courts , with the Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate authority on the matter . </P> <P> With the Charter 's supremacy confirmed by section 52 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , the courts continued their practice of striking down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes as they had with earlier case law regarding federalism . However , under section 24 of the Charter , courts also gained new powers to enforce creative remedies and exclude more evidence in trials . Courts have since made many important decisions , including R. v. Morgentaler ( 1988 ) , which struck down Canada 's abortion law , and Vriend v. Alberta ( 1998 ) , in which the Supreme Court found the province 's exclusion of homosexuals from protection against discrimination violated section 15 . In the latter case , the Court then read the protection into the law . </P> <P> Courts may receive Charter questions in a number of ways . Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a criminal law that they argue is unconstitutional . Others may feel government services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with the Charter , and apply to lower - level courts for injunctions against the government ( as was the case in Doucet - Boudreau v. Nova Scotia ( Minister of Education ) ) . A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting reference questions to higher - level courts ; for example , Prime Minister Paul Martin 's government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case Re Same - Sex Marriage ( 2004 ) . Provinces may also do this with their superior courts . The government of Prince Edward Island initiated the Provincial Judges Reference by asking its provincial Supreme Court a question on judicial independence under section 11 . </P> The building of the Supreme Court of Canada , the chief authority on the interpretation of the Charter <P> In several important cases , judges developed various tests and precedents for interpreting specific provisions of the Charter . These include the Oakes test for section 1 , set out in the case R. v. Oakes ( 1986 ) , and the ( now defunct ) Law test for section 15 , developed in Law v. Canada ( 1999 ) . Since Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act ( 1985 ) , various approaches to defining and expanding the scope of fundamental justice ( the Canadian name for natural justice or due process ) under section 7 have been adopted . ( For more information , see the articles on each Charter section ) . </P> <P> In general , courts have embraced a purposive interpretation of Charter rights . This means that since early cases like Hunter v. Southam ( 1984 ) and R. v. Big M Drug Mart ( 1985 ) , they have concentrated not on the traditional , limited understanding of what each right meant when the Charter was adopted in 1982 , but rather on changing the scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose . This is tied to the generous interpretation of rights , as the purpose of the Charter provisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a variety of circumstances , at the expense of the government powers . Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has approved of the generous approach in some cases , although for others he argues the purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as courts have imagined . Indeed , this approach has not been without its critics . Alberta politician Ted Morton and political scientist Rainer Knopff have been very critical of this phenomenon . Although they feel the basis for the approach , the living tree doctrine ( the classical name for generous interpretations of the Canadian Constitution ) , is sound , they argue Charter case law has been more radical . When the living tree doctrine is applied right , the authors claim , `` The elm remained an elm ; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak or a willow . '' The doctrine can be used , for example , so a right is upheld even when a government threatens to violate it with new technology , as long as the essential right remains the same ; but the authors claim that the courts have used the doctrine to `` create new rights . '' As an example , the authors note that the Charter right against self - incrimination has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system that had previously been unregulated by self - incrimination rights in other Canadian laws . </P> <P> Another general approach to interpreting Charter rights is to consider international legal precedents with countries that have specific rights protections , such as the United States Bill of Rights ( an influence on aspects of the Charter ) and the Constitution of South Africa . However , international precedent is only of guiding value , and is not binding . For example , the Supreme Court has referred to the Charter and the American Bill of Rights as being `` born to different countries in different ages and in different circumstances . '' </P> <P> Public interest groups frequently intervene in cases to make arguments on how to interpret the Charter . Some examples are the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association , Canadian Civil Liberties Association , the Canadian Mental Health Association , the Canadian Labour Congress , the Women 's Legal Education and Action Fund ( LEAF ) , and REAL Women of Canada . The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group . </P> <P> A further approach to the Charter , taken by the courts , is the dialogue principle , which involves greater participation by elected governments . This approach involves governments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts acknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged . </P> <H2> Comparisons with other Human rights documents ( edit ) </H2> The United States Bill of Rights influenced the text of the Charter , but its rights provisions are interpreted more conservatively . Canadian civil - rights and constitutional cases as compared to American cases occasionally have dissimilar outcomes because the broader Charter rights are limited by the `` savings clause '' of section 1 of the Charter as interpreted in R. v. Oakes <P> Some Canadian Members of Parliament saw the movement to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of Parliamentary supremacy . Others would say that the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) has now limited British parliamentary power to a greater degree than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian Parliament and provincial legislatures . Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the Human Rights Act 1998 , which allows the ECHR to be enforced directly in domestic courts , partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter . </P> <P> The Canadian Charter bears a number of similarities to the European Convention , specifically in relation to the limitations clauses contained in the European document . Because of this similarity with European human rights law , the Supreme Court of Canada turns not only to the Constitution of the United States case law in interpreting the Charter , but also to European Court of Human Rights cases . </P> <P> The core distinction between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian Charter is the existence of the limitations and notwithstanding clauses . Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively . However , due to the limitations clause , where a violation of a right exists , the law will not necessarily grant protection of that right . In contrast , rights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights . The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights . Fundamental justice ( in section 7 of the Canadian Charter ) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process , which is its US equivalent . Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more wide - ranging scope than the First Amendment to the United States Constitution 's freedom of speech . In RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd. ( 1986 ) , the Canadian Supreme Court considered picketing of the kind the US First Amendment did not permit , as it was disruptive conduct ( though there was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise protect ) . The Supreme Court , however , ruled the picketing , including the disruptive conduct , were fully protected under section 2 of the Charter . The Court then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing was just . The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US . The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld some of Quebec 's limits on the use of English on signs and has upheld publication bans that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals . </P> <P> Section 28 of the Charter performs a function similar to that of the unratified Equal Rights Amendment in the US . While that proposed amendment had many critics , there was no comparable opposition to the Charter 's section 28 . Still , Canadian feminists had to stage large protests to demonstrate support for the inclusion of the section which had not been part of the original draft of the charter . </P> <P> The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has several parallels with the Canadian Charter , but in some cases the Covenant goes further with regard to rights in its text . For example , a right to legal aid has been read into section 10 of the Charter ( the right to counsel ) , but the Covenant explicitly guarantees the accused need not pay `` if he does not have sufficient means . '' </P> <P> The Canadian Charter has little to say , explicitly at least , about economic and social rights . On this point , it stands in marked contrast with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and with the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to security of the person and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant . The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment . Canadian courts , however , have been hesitant in this area , stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights , economic rights are of questionable legitimacy . </P> <P> The Charter itself influenced the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa . The limitations clause under section 36 of the South African law has been compared to section 1 of that Charter . </P> <P> Jamaica 's Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms was also influenced , in part , by the Canadian charter . </P> <H2> The Charter and national values ( edit ) </H2> The `` March of Hearts '' rally for same - sex marriage equality under the Charter in 2004 . <P> The Charter was intended to be a source for Canadian values and national unity . As Professor Alan Cairns noted , `` The initial federal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity . '' Trudeau himself later wrote in his Memoirs that `` Canada itself '' could now be defined as a `` society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom '' , and that all Canadians could identify with the values of liberty and equality . </P> <P> The Charter 's unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and language rights . According to author Rand Dyck , some scholars believe section 23 , with its minority language education rights , `` was the only part of the Charter with which Pierre Trudeau was truly concerned '' . Through the mobility and language rights , French Canadians , who have been at the centre of unity debates , are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive government and educational services in their own language . Hence , they are not confined to Quebec ( the only province where they form the majority and where most of their population is based ) , which would polarize the country along regional lines . The Charter was also supposed to standardize previously diverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle of liberty . </P> <P> Former premier of Ontario Bob Rae has stated that the Charter `` functions as a symbol for all Canadians '' in practice because it represents the core value of freedom . Academic Peter Russell has been more skeptical of the Charter 's value in this field . Cairns , who feels the Charter is the most important constitutional document to many Canadians , and that the Charter was meant to shape the Canadian identity , has also expressed concern that groups within society see certain provisions as belonging to them alone rather than to all Canadians . It has also been noted that issues like abortion and pornography , raised by the Charter , tend to be controversial . Still , opinion polls in 2002 showed Canadians felt the Charter significantly represented Canada , although many were unaware of the document 's actual contents . </P> <P> The only values mentioned by the Charter 's preamble are recognition for the supremacy of God and the rule of law , but these have been controversial and of minor legal consequence . In 1999 , MP Svend Robinson brought forward a failed proposal before the Canadian House of Commons that would have amended the Charter by removing the mention of God , as he felt it did not reflect Canada 's diversity . </P> <P> Section 27 also recognizes a value of multiculturalism . In 2002 , polls found 86 % of Canadians approved of this section . </P> <H2> Criticism ( edit ) </H2> <P> While the Charter has enjoyed a great deal of popularity , with 82 % of Canadians describing it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999 , the document has also been subject to published criticisms from both sides of the political spectrum . One left - wing critic is Professor Michael Mandel , who wrote that in comparison to politicians , judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate , nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen . This , in Mandel 's view , limits democracy . Mandel has also asserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States , especially by serving corporate rights and individual rights rather than group rights and social rights . He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the Charter , such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education . Hence , the perceived Americanization of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians . The union movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity , such as the `` right to strike '' . </P> <P> Right - wing critics Morton and Knopff have raised several concerns about the Charter , notably by alleging that the federal government has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest groups . In their book The Charter Revolution & the Court Party , Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail , accusing the Trudeau and Chr\u00e9tien governments of funding litigious groups . For example , these governments used the Court Challenges Program to support minority language educational rights claims . Morton and Knopff also assert that crown counsel has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights , particularly gay rights and women 's rights . </P> <P> Political scientist Rand Dyck , in observing these criticisms , notes that while judges have had their scope of review widened , they have still upheld most laws challenged on Charter grounds . With regard to litigious interest groups , Dyck points out that `` the record is not as clear as Morton and Knopff imply . All such groups have experienced wins and losses . '' </P> <P> The political philosopher Charles Blattberg has criticized the Charter for contributing to the fragmentation of the country , at both the individual and group levels . In encouraging discourse based upon rights , the Charter is said to inject an adversarial spirit into Canadian politics , making it difficult to realize the common good . Blattberg also claims that the Charter undercuts the Canadian political community since it is ultimately a cosmopolitan document .

Candidates are nominated by the President of the United States and must face a series of hearings in which both the nominee and other witnesses make statements and answer questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee , which can vote to send the nomination to the full United States Senate . Confirmation by the Senate allows the President to formally appoint the candidate to the court . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Nomination </Li> <Li> 2 Confirmation </Li> <Li> 3 Recess appointments </Li> <Li> 4 Tenure and vacancies </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Nomination ( edit ) </H2> <P> Article Two of the United States Constitution requires the President of the United States to nominate Supreme Court Justices and , with Senate confirmation , requires Justices to be appointed . This was for the division of power between the President and Senate by the founders , who wrote : </P> <Dl> <Dd> `` he shall nominate , and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , shall appoint ... Judges of the supreme Court ... '' </Dd> </Dl> <P> Upon the election of a new President , incoming White House staff prepare profiles of possible candidates for the Supreme Court , considering not only judges but also politicians and other individuals whom they consider appropriate for the role . Besides considering national figures whose views are well - known , they consider others who are less recognized . They go through published rulings , articles , speeches , and other background material to get an idea of candidates ' values and views on constitutional issues . Age , health , race , gender , and likelihood of confirmation are also factored into considerations . Once a Supreme Court vacancy opens , the President discusses the candidates with advisors . Senators also call the President with suggestions . After a first choice is decided , the candidate is contacted and called on by the President to serve on the highest court . Staffers send a vetting form for the candidate to fill out . They visit the candidate to go over tax records and payments to domestic help . Candidates whom the President has never met are interviewed by White House officials before being sent to the White House to be interviewed in person by the President . After making a final decision , the President calls the candidate , who is told to prepare a statement for an appearance in front of the national press for the President 's formal announcement . </P> <P> Most Presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological views . In many cases , however , a Justice 's decisions may be contrary to what the nominating President anticipated . A famous instance was Chief Justice Earl Warren ; President Dwight D. Eisenhower expected him to be a conservative judge , but his decisions are arguably among the most liberal in the Court 's history . Eisenhower later called the appointment `` the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made '' . Another Justice whose decisions ran contrary to what was believed to be his ideology was David Souter , who was nominated to the high court in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush . Many pundits and politicians at the time expected Souter to be a conservative ; however , after becoming a Justice , his opinions generally fell on the liberal side of the political spectrum . </P> <P> Because the Constitution does not set any qualifications for service as a Justice , the President may nominate any individual to serve on the Court . However , that person must receive the confirmation of the Senate . </P> <H2> Confirmation ( edit ) </H2> <P> In modern times , the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from special - interest groups , many of which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee , depending on whether the nominee 's track record aligns with the group 's views . The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings , questioning nominees to determine their suitability . By convention , nominees avoid revealing too much about their views on potential cases that may come before the Court . At the close of confirmation hearings , the Committee votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive , negative or neutral report . </P> The Roberts Court ( April 2017 - present ) . Front row ( left to right ) : Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Anthony Kennedy , John Roberts ( Chief Justice ) , Clarence Thomas , and Stephen Breyer . Back row ( left to right ) : Elena Kagan , Samuel A. Alito , Sonia Sotomayor , and Neil Gorsuch . <P> The Committee 's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent , beginning with Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925 . Some western senators were concerned with his links to Wall Street and expressed their opposition when Stone was nominated . Stone proposed what was then the novelty of appearing before the Judiciary Committee to answer questions ; his testimony helped secure a confirmation vote with very little opposition . The second nominee to appear before the Committee was Felix Frankfurter , who only addressed ( at the Committee 's request ) what he considered to be slanderous allegations against him . The modern practice of the Committee questioning nominees on their judicial views began with the nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in 1955 ; the nomination came shortly after the Court handed down the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision , and several Southern senators attempted to block Harlan 's confirmation , hence the decision to testify . </P> <P> Once the Committee reports out the nomination , the whole Senate considers it . A simple majority vote is required to confirm or to reject a nominee . Prior to 2017 , a successful filibuster threat could add the requirement of a supermajority of 60 needed in favor of cloture , which would allow debate to end and force a final vote on confirmation . Rejections are relatively uncommon ; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees in its history . The most recent rejection of a nominee by vote of the full Senate came in 1987 , when the Senate refused to confirm Robert Bork . </P> <P> Not everyone nominated by the President has received a floor vote in the Senate . Prior to 2017 a nominee could be filibustered once debate on the nomination had begun in the full Senate . A filibuster indefinitely prolongs the debate , preventing a final vote on the nominee . President Lyndon Johnson 's nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee . It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas 's ethics . President Donald Trump 's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat vacated by Antonin Scalia was the second . Unlike the Fortas filibuster , however , only Democratic Senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination , citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy , and the Republican majority 's prior refusal to take up Obama 's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy . This led the Republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations . </P> <P> Not every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate . A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs , typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee ; this occurred most recently with the nomination of Harriet Miers in 2006 before Committee hearings had begun , citing concerns about Senate requests during her confirmation process for access to internal Executive Branch documents resulting from her position as White House Counsel . In 1987 , President Ronald Reagan withdrew the nomination of Douglas H. Ginsburg because of news reports containing marijuana use allegations . </P> <P> The Senate may also fail to act on the nomination , which expires at the end of the session . For example , President Dwight Eisenhower 's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate ; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955 , and Harlan was confirmed two months later . Most recently , the Senate failed to act on President Barack Obama 's nomination of Merrick Garland in March 2016 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia ; the nomination expired in January 2017 , and the vacancy was later filled by President Trump 's appointment of Neil Gorsuch . </P> <P> Before 1981 the approval process of Justices was usually rapid . From the Truman through Nixon administrations , Justices were typically approved within one month . From the Reagan administration to the present , however , the process has taken much longer . According to the Congressional Research Service , the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days ( 2.2 months ) , while the median is 71 days ( or 2.3 months ) . Some believe this is because Congress sees Justices as playing a more political role than in the past . The perceived politicization of the process has drawn criticism . For example , columnist George F. Will termed the defeat of Robert Bork 's nomination `` unjust '' and , more generally , that the nomination process does `` not delve deeply into the nominee 's jurisprudential thinking . '' Supreme Court nominations have caused media speculation about whether the judge leans to the left , middle , or right . One indication of the politicized selection process is how much time each nominee spends being questioned under the glare of media coverage ; before 1925 , nominees were never questioned ; after 1955 , every nominee has been required to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answer questions ; and the hours spent being grilled have lengthened from single digits ( before 1980 ) to double digits today . Another example of the politicization of the process was the Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination , which remained before the Senate far longer than any other nominee . </P> <P> Following is a table of the approximate number of hours that media sources estimate were spent on the questioning of Supreme Court nominees : </P> <Table> Supreme Court Nominees : Hours Spent Being Questioned <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Nominee </Th> <Th> Hours </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1925 </Td> <Td> Harlan Fiske Stone </Td> <Td> 7000500000000000000 \u2660 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1938 </Td> <Td> Felix Frankfurter </Td> <Td> * </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1955 </Td> <Td> John Marshall Harlan II </Td> <Td> * </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1957 </Td> <Td> William J.

The President then prepares and signs a commission , and causes the Seal of the United States Department of Justice to be affixed to the document before the new Justice can take office . The date of commission determines a Justice 's seniority . A ceremony is held in which the Justice must take the Constitutional Oath , which is used for every federal and state officeholder below the President , and the Judicial Oath used for federal judges before entering into the execution of their office . </P> <H2> Recess appointments ( edit ) </H2> Potter Stewart , appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower , was the last Supreme Court Justice initially placed on the Court through a recess appointment . <P> Article II , Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides that : </P> <Dl> <Dd> The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . </Dd> </Dl> <P> Thus , when the Senate is in recess , the President may make a temporary appointment to any office requiring Senate approval , including filling vacancies on the Supreme Court , without the Senate 's advice and consent . Such a recess appointee to the Supreme Court holds office only until the end of the next Senate session ( always less than two years ) . To continue to serve thereafter and be compensated for his or her service , the nominee must be formally nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate . Of the ten Justices who have received recess appointments - two Chief Justices and eight Associate Justices - only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed for a regular appointment . No president since Dwight Eisenhower ( who made three such appointments ) has made a recess appointment to the Supreme Court and the practice has become highly controversial even when applied to lower federal courts . During the 110th Congress , the Democratic leadership of the Senate specifically blocked Republican President George W.

Being a resolution , it has no legally binding effect , but was intended as an expression of the position of the Senate and as a guide to executive actions .

The Constitution provides that justices `` shall hold their offices during good behavior '' ( unless appointed during a Senate recess ) . The term `` good behavior '' is well understood to mean Justices may serve for the remainder of their lives , although they can voluntarily resign or retire . A Justice can also be removed by Congressional impeachment and conviction . However , only one Justice has been impeached by the House ( Samuel Chase , in 1805 ) and he was acquitted in the Senate . Moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently ( for example , William O. Douglas was the subject of hearings twice , once in 1953 and again in 1970 ) , but they have not reached a vote in the House . No mechanism presently exists for removing a Justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury , both unable to resign and unable to resume service . </P> <P> Because Justices have indefinite tenure , it is impossible to know when a vacancy will next occur . Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession , as in the early 1970s when Lewis Franklin Powell , Jr. and William H. Rehnquist were nominated to replace Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II , who retired within a week of each other . Sometimes a great length of time passes between nominations such as the eleven years between Stephen Breyer 's nomination in 1994 and the departures of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor ( by death and retirement , respectively ) in 2005 and 2006 . </P> <P> It is also theoretically possible for Congress to create additional vacancies by expanding the Court itself . The United States Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court , but in Article III it authorizes the Congress to fix the number of justices . The Judiciary Act of 1789 called for the appointment of six justices . As the country grew geographically , Congress increased the number of justices to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits . In 1807 , the court was expanded to seven members , allowing Thomas Jefferson to appoint Thomas Todd as a new Justice . The expansion to nine members in 1837 allowed Andrew Jackson to appoint John Catron , and Martin Van Buren to appoint John McKinley ; and the addition of a tenth seat in 1863 allowed Abraham Lincoln to name Stephen Johnson Field to the Court . However , at the request of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase , Congress passed the Judicial Circuits Act ( 1866 ) which provided that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced ; thus , the size of the Court should have eventually reached seven by attrition . Consequently , one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867 . However , this law did not play out to completion , for in the Judiciary Act of 1869 , also known as the Circuit Judges Act , the number of justices was again set at nine , where it has since remained . The new seat created in 1869 was filled the following year by Ulysses S. Grant 's appointment of Joseph P. Bradley - the last justice to be appointed to a newly created seat on the Court . </P> <P> President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937 , seeking to appoint an additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement ; under Roosevelt 's proposal , such appointments would continue until the Court reached a maximum size of 15 justices . Ostensibly , the proposal was made to ease the burdens of the docket on the elderly judges , but the President 's actual purpose was to pack the Court with justices who would support New Deal policies and legislation . This plan , usually called the `` Court - packing Plan '' , failed in Congress and proved a political disaster for Roosevelt . The balance of the Court shifted with the retirement of Willis Van Devanter and the confirmation of Hugo Black in August 1937 . By the end of 1941 , Roosevelt had appointed seven Supreme Court justices and elevated Harlan Fiske Stone to Chief Justice . </P> <P> Despite the variability , nearly all Presidents so far have been able to appoint at least one Justice . The four exceptions are William Henry Harrison , Zachary Taylor , Andrew Johnson , and Jimmy Carter . Harrison died a month after taking office , though his successor ( John Tyler ) made an appointment during that presidential term . Taylor likewise died early in his presidential term , although his successor ( Millard Fillmore ) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term . Johnson was denied the opportunity to appoint a Justice by a contraction in the size of the Supreme Court , which Congress may dictate . Jimmy Carter is the only President who completed at least one full term in office without making a nomination to the Court during his presidency . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ See Black , Ryan C. ; Owens , Ryan J. `` Courting the President : How Circuit Court Judges Alter Their Behavior for Promotion to the Supreme Court '' .

Fox in the films and voiced by David Kaufman in the animated series and AJ LoCascio in Back to the Future : The Game ) is the son of George McFly and Lorraine Baines McFly .

At various points in time , Doc helps Marty restore the space - time continuum and reverse the changes that were caused by time travel . </P> <P> In 2008 , the character was selected by film magazine Empire as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time , ranking at # 20 . </P> <H3> Biff Tannen ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Biff Tannen <P> Biff Howard Tannen ( portrayed by Thomas F. Wilson in the films and animated series and voiced by Kid Beyond in Back to the Future : The Game ) is the main antagonist of the first 2 films and a local bully who harassed George McFly and has once altered history in the second film . He comes from a long line of bullies in Hill Valley , most of whom harassed members of the McFly family . Biff is also a descendant of Buford Tannen ( also portrayed by Wilson ) , who is one of Hill Valley 's outlaws during the 1880s . </P> <H2> McFly family ( edit ) </H2> <H3> George McFly ( edit ) </H3> <P> George Douglas McFly ( portrayed by Crispin Glover in Back to the Future and by Jeffrey Weissman in Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III and voiced by Michael X . Sommers in Back to the Future : The Game ) is the father of Marty , Linda and Dave from the union with his wife Lorraine Baines McFly . Although he is one of the main characters in the first movie , George only makes cameos in Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III . </P> <P> In the first film , George is portrayed as weak and the main target of Biff Tannen 's bullying . The novelization of the film expounds on George 's history of weakness , describing two incidents in which he is unable to stand up for himself . In 1955 , in contrast with Marty , George did not have any friends for support and was targeted not only by Biff and his gang but also other kids in school . He has a penchant for science fiction , and writes some of his own but never allows himself to share them with anyone due to his fear of rejection . In 1955 , with Marty 's help , he gets the courage to stand up to Biff , knocking him unconscious . As a result , he and Lorraine fall in love and George becomes popular in school for defeating Biff in a fight . In the new future , they are both happily married with George working as a college professor and being a successful writer who orders Biff around . In the alternate timeline in Part II , George was murdered by Biff in 1973 . </P> <P> George 's character was greatly reduced in the sequels , and the role was recast to Jeffrey Weissman . Weissman wore prosthetics to resemble Glover and imitated Glover 's rendering of McFly , and his scenes were spliced with shots of Glover from Back to the Future . The result was so convincing that many people were fooled by it . Glover did not appreciate this , and sued . The lawsuit resulted in the adoption of stricter rules by the Screen Actors Guild to prevent this situation from occurring again . </P> <H3> Lorraine Baines - McFly ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lorraine Baines - McFly ( portrayed by Lea Thompson and voiced by Aimee Miles in Back to the Future : The Game ) is the wife of George McFly and the mother of Marty , Linda and Dave . She is the eldest daughter of Sam ( George DiCenzo ) and Stella ( Frances Lee McCain ) Baines , and sister of Milton ( Jason Hervey ) , Sally ( Maia Brewton ) , Toby , and Joey . </P> <P> In Back to the Future , Lorraine is initially portrayed in 1985 as middle - aged and unhappy . After Marty changes the timeline , she is shown to be fit and happily married to George in 1985 . In Part II , she is still happily married to George in 2015 , but in the dystopian alternate 1985 timeline she is widowed and married to Biff . </P> <H3> Dave McFly ( edit ) </H3> <P> David `` Dave '' McFly ( portrayed by Marc McClure ) is the eldest child of George and Lorraine McFly . In 1985 before Marty went to 1955 , Dave works at Burger King , but in the post-time travel 1985 he wears a suit as a nondescript white - collar worker for an accounting firm . In a deleted scene from Part II , the alternate 1985 timeline shows that Dave is an alcoholic and a gambling addict following George 's death and Lorraine 's second marriage to Biff . </P> <H3> Linda McFly ( edit ) </H3> <P> Linda McFly ( portrayed by Wendie Jo Sperber ) is the middle child and only daughter of George and Lorraine McFly . In 1985 before Marty went to 1955 , Linda is having boy trouble and it is unknown if she is in college or has a job . In 1985 after Marty went to 1955 , Linda works in a boutique and has gained the attention of many boys . </P> <H3> Seamus and Maggie McFly ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seamus and Maggie McFly ( portrayed by Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson ) are Irish immigrants and the paternal great - great - grandparents of Marty McFly . In Part III , Marty is befriended by Seamus and Maggie . While Maggie does not trust the `` strange young man '' , Seamus has a familiar feeling about him and believes that helping him is the right thing to do . They have a son named William ( Marty 's great - grandfather ) . Much like his descendants , Seamus is harassed by a member of the Tannen family , Buford Tannen . </P> <P> Maggie McFly is played by Lea Thompson , who also plays Marty 's mother Lorraine , even though Maggie is not an ancestor of Lorraine ; in a DVD commentary track for Part III , Bob Gale states that the creative team considered it important to include Thompson in the film , and he imagines that McFly men are simply `` genetically predisposed '' to be attracted to women who look like her . </P> <H3> Marty ( Jr. . ) and Marlene McFly ( edit ) </H3> <P> Marty ( Jr . ) and Marlene McFly ( both portrayed by Michael J. Fox ) are Marty McFly and Jennifer Parker 's future fraternal twin son and daughter in Part II . </P> <P> Originally Marty ( Jr . ) was to be arrested for joining a robbery initiated by Griff and his gang .

Jules , an introvert , mostly imitates his father 's interests and mannerisms while Verne appears to be more outgoing and extroverted . Several plot points of the animated series revolve around either Jules or Verne altering history and the steps necessary to correct the damage . </P> <H3> Copernicus ( edit ) </H3> <P> Copernicus is Doc 's dog from 1955 .

He later marries Edna Strickland and reforms from his criminal ways with her help . </P> <H3> Buford `` Mad dog '' Tannen ( edit ) </H3> <P> Buford Tannen ( portrayed by Thomas F. Wilson in Back to the Future Part III ) is the main antagonist of the third film . He is the great - grandfather of Biff Tannen and the local town outlaw in 1885 Hill Valley . He was nicknamed `` Mad Dog '' by a newspaper reporter , due to his violent temper and propensity for drooling , a nickname Tannen greatly despises . Buford is cruel , homicidal , rude , and emotionally unstable . He displays a need for control and is brought down to childlike tantrums when he is humiliated or makes mistakes , whether it be something that happens to him or something he says or does . He is often accompanied by his gang ( played by Christopher Wynne , Sean Sullivan and Mike Watson ) , and developed a feud with Marshal James Strickland and his deputies . </P> <H3> Griff ( edit ) </H3> <P> Griff ( portrayed by Thomas F.

After Marty alters her original timeline , Edna marries Kid Tannen who becomes the father of Biff Tannen . </P> <H2> Other characters ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Jennifer Parker ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jennifer Jane Parker is the girlfriend ( and , in 2015 in Back to the Future Part II , the wife ) of Marty McFly . </P> <P> The character was played by Claudia Wells in Back to the Future . However , Wells was not available to film the sequels for personal reasons , and the role was recast to Elisabeth Shue although Wells reprised her role as Jennifer in Back to the Future : The Game as a punk rock version of her character . Consequently , the opening scene of Back to the Future Part II was re-shot with Shue taking Wells ' place , rather than using the ending of Back to the Future . In the spin - off Back to the Future : the Animated Series , Jennifer was voiced by Cathy Cavadini . </P> <P> In 1985 , Jennifer attends Hill Valley High School , along with her boyfriend Marty . In the animated series , Jennifer is enrolled to Hill Valley College with Marty after graduating high school and working part - time as a tutor .

Needles often goads Marty into doing reckless things such as a street race that leads Marty to crash into a Rolls Royce and an illegal transaction which results in his firing in 2015 . </P> <H3> Goldie Wilson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Goldie Wilson ( played by Donald Fullilove in part 1 ) is a young man working at Lou 's Cafe in 1955 who goes on to become the first black Mayor of Hill Valley in the 1980s . A campaign poster shows the name Goldie in quotation marks , suggesting Goldie is a nickname , presumably in reference to his gold tooth . He would also have a grandson , Goldie Wilson III ( also played by Fullilove ) in Part II , who works as a car salesman . </P> <H3> Match , Skinhead , and 3 - D ( edit ) </H3> <P> Match ( portrayed by Billy Zane ) , Skinhead ( portrayed by Jeffrey Jay Cohen ) , and 3 - D ( portrayed by Casey Siemaszko ) are the three high school boys who make up Biff Tannen 's gang in 1955 . Their nicknames are only given in the films ' novels , screenplays , and credits . Only one of their real names is mentioned in the movies -- Biff refers to Skinhead as Joey in one of the 1955 scenes in Back to the Future Part II , while outside of the `` Enchantment Under the Sea '' dance . </P> <P> In the alternate 1985 , the three work in Biff 's casino as his bodyguards . Each gets his nickname from a distinctive character trait . Match often has a match sticking out of his mouth ; Skinhead has very short , close - cropped hair ; 3 - D is always wearing a pair of anaglyphic 3 - D glasses ( a reference to the 3 - D movies that were popular in the 1950s ) . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Film in the United States portal </Li> <Li> Science fiction portal </Li> <Li> Fictional characters portal </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Empire 's The 100 Greatest Movie Characters '' .

He made his first appearance during `` A Hard Day 's Night '' , which was broadcast on March 27 , 2005 . Derek was married to Addison Montgomery ( Kate Walsh ) for 12 years , before their divorce in 2006 . Before his death in 2015 , Derek was happily married to his longtime girlfriend Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) . The couple are often referred to as `` Mer & Der '' and they have three children together . Shepherd was formerly the Chief of Surgery at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital , but abruptly resigned as chief in season 7 following the shooting . For his portrayal of Shepherd , Dempsey was nominated in 2006 and 2007 Golden Globe for the Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series Drama for the role , and the 2006 SAG Award for the Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Drama Series award . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Storyline </Li> <Li> 2 Development <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Casting and creation </Li> <Li> 2.2 Characterization </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Reception </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Storyline ( edit ) </H2> <P> Derek arrives at Seattle Grace Hospital as the new Head of Neurosurgery from New York City . He is a Bowdoin College graduate and attended Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alongside his childhood best friend Mark Sloan and ex-wife Addison Montgomery and Private Practice characters Naomi Bennett and Sam Bennett . Derek was a student of Dr. Richard Webber and was enticed to come with an `` offer he could n't refuse '' -- the position of Chief of Surgery , which he eventually turned down . He specializes in highly complex tumors and conditions of the brain and spine and came to Seattle Grace with a reputation for taking on `` lost causes '' and `` impossible '' cases that most of his peers would turn down . As an attending he is both well - liked and feared -- well - liked by patients and his scrub nurses for his compassion and gentlemanly bedside manner and feared by interns and residents who are intimidated by his reputation and high standards . He is passionate about his job and has been known to expel staff or remove interns and residents ( or at least threaten them ) from his service for being disrespectful about patients or if he deems their attitude to be detrimental to his patient 's well - being . </P> <P> Derek first meets Meredith Grey at a bar , and soon finds out that she is an intern at Seattle Grace . They begin to have feelings for one another and it causes some awkwardness at work , particularly after her supervising resident Dr. Miranda Bailey discovers their relationship . Meredith 's housemates and fellow interns George O'Malley and Izzie Stevens both antagonized her for some time as they felt she was using her relationship with Derek to further her career . He generally tolerated them despite his dislike of sharing his living space with the interns who worked under him . While most of his family members accepted Meredith , his sister , Nancy , particularly disliked her and repeatedly called her `` the slutty intern '' ; as of season nine she still refuses to speak to Meredith or acknowledge her as her sister - in - law . His mother Carolyn approved as she felt Meredith 's gray perspective of life complemented Derek 's tendency to see everything in black and white . </P> <P> Derek 's background was generally a mystery for the first season and source of speculation amongst his colleagues due to his sudden departure from an established and highly respected practice in New York . In the season one finale , his past eventually catches up with him when his estranged wife Addison moves to Seattle and is offered a position by Dr. Webber . Shortly thereafter , his childhood best friend Mark joins Seattle Grace as the new head of plastic surgery . Derek and Addison attempt to repair their marriage but attempts were futile . Since their divorce they have remained on amicable terms , with Addison even admonishing Meredith for breaking up with Derek in season three . In the Private Practice episode `` Ex-Life '' Derek finally tells Addison that his mother never liked her in the first place . He admits to Meredith that Addison cheating on him with Mark was partly his fault as an absentee husband . Addison eventually leaves Seattle for a private practice in Los Angeles , spawning the spin - off Private Practice . In the season eight episode `` If / Then '' , Meredith dreams of an alternate universe where her mother never had Alzheimer 's ; Derek and Addison are still married but their strained relationship and Shepherd 's disillusionment causes his career to stagnate , earning him the nicknames `` Bad Shepherd '' and `` McDreary '' . </P> <P> When Derek is offered the Chief of Surgery position for the second time , he persuades the board to keep Dr. Webber on the staff . During the merger of Seattle Grace with Mercy West their relationship sours when Derek disagreed with Richard 's handling of the merger and Richard begins to display uncharacteristic behavior , not unnoticed by his fellow surgeons . Derek learns from Meredith that Richard has since resumed drinking and feels forced to have him removed as Chief of Surgery . With mixed feelings , Derek offers him an ultimatum : go into rehab and possibly pick up where he left off after , or quit completely . </P> <P> In seasons three and four , Meredith and Derek 's relationship becomes rocky and they each take time to date other people . Derek 's plans to propose were ruined by a series of unfortunate events in season five . In the season finale , they decide to give their planned wedding to Alex and Izzie . Due to their tight schedule , they instead informally marry and Derek writes down their `` promises '' on a post-it note . They legalize their marriage in season seven in order to adopt Zola , a young African orphan treated for spina bifida . They briefly separate after Meredith tampers with their Alzheimer 's trial , jeopardizing her career and tarnishing Derek 's reputation . Zola is taken away from Meredith after a social worker finds out she and Derek are living separately . In later seasons , Derek often griped about how his subsequent interns and residents -- mainly Lexie Grey , Shane Ross and Heather Brooks -- did not quite measure up to Meredith . The social worker comes back and announces they are the official parents of Zola . As Meredith nears the end of her fifth year of residency , she and Derek are torn between staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West or leaving for Boston where Derek would work at Harvard while Meredith would be at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital . </P> <P> Following his rescue from the plane crash that killed Mark and Lexie , Derek learns that he may only regain 80 percent of his hand 's function . He comes to terms with the fact that his career as a surgeon may be over and is grateful that he is alive . When Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) , head of orthopedic surgery , tells him a more risky surgery could give him back full function of his hand or reduce its function if it goes wrong , he agrees , accepting the possibility of never again holding a scalpel . Derek recovers well and Callie clears him to return to work , but it is still weeks later that he feels ready to operate . Derek , Callie and fellow resident Jackson Avery decide to do nerve transplant for his hand . Meredith , newly pregnant with their second child , goes behind his back and calls his sisters so they can donate a nerve to him . Lizzie ( Neve Campbell ) , Derek 's younger sister , agrees to donate a nerve and the surgery is a success . </P> <P> Derek and Meredith 's marriage is strained after he accepted an invitation from the President to participate in the Brain - Mapping Initiative . He went back on his promise to her that he would not add to his current workload in order to devote time to their two young children and allow her the chance to establish her career as a full - fledged attending . Eventually he was offered a position at the National Institutes of Health in Washington , D.C. , but Meredith puts her foot down and refuses to leave her hometown and uproot their young family . His youngest sister Amelia ( Caterina Scorsone ) takes over his position at Grey Sloan . Meanwhile , he and Meredith fight bitterly on and off over whether they should move . After a bad argument , he accepts the job in the heat of the moment and leaves for Washington . While there , he and Meredith talk things out over the phone and come to a mutual conclusion that they both did not want to end their marriage . He tells her that just being with her , raising their children and operating on patients was more satisfying than `` saving the world '' . </P> <P> In season 11 , Derek is involved in a fatal car accident while driving to the airport for his final trip to Washington . He is able to hear and process auditory input , but unable to speak . He is recognized by Winnie , one of the victims of a crash he assisted in earlier , who tells the surgeons that their patient 's name is Derek and that he is a surgeon as well . The hospital he was taken to was understaffed and his head injury was not detected quickly enough by the interns on duty that night . Although the neurosurgeon on call is paged multiple times , he takes too long to arrive and Derek is declared brain dead . Police arrive at Meredith 's door and take her to see Derek , where she consents to removing him from life support . At the time of his death , Meredith was pregnant with their third child . She gives birth to a daughter whom she names Ellis after her mother . </P> <P> Derek was mentioned or referenced to a number of times in season 12 as the other characters struggle to cope with his sudden death . In the episode `` My Next Life '' , Meredith had a flashback of their first ever surgery together when a patient named Katie Bryce was admitted to the hospital with a brain aneurysm . Amelia took his death especially hard as he was the sibling she was closest to . At the end of the season , prior to her wedding to Derek 's long - time colleague Owen Hunt , Amelia goes on a nervous rant about how Derek was supposed to be the one to give her away , him having given away their three other sisters at their weddings . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Casting and creation ( edit ) </H3> <P> When Patrick Dempsey auditioned for the role of Derek Shepherd , he was afraid that he was not going to get the part . Creator Shonda Rhimes ' first reaction was : `` The very first time I met him , I was absolutely sure that he was my guy . Reading the lines of Derek Shepherd , Patrick had a vulnerable charm that I just fell for . And he had amazing chemistry with Ellen Pompeo . '' Rhimes admitted that Dempsey 's dyslexia threw her at first , particularly at the first few table readings : `` I did not know about Patrick 's dyslexia in the beginning . I actually thought that he did n't like the scripts from the way he approached the readings . When I found out , I completely understood his hesitation . Now that we all know , if he is struggling with a word , the other actors are quick to step up and help him out . Everyone is very respectful . '' Isaiah Washington also auditioned for the part and when he did not get it , he said his reaction was like `` I 'd been kicked in the stomach by 14 mules . '' Washington was , however , later cast as Preston Burke . Rob Lowe was also considered to portray Shepherd but turned the role down . Some of the character 's medical cases were inspired by real - life patients of Steve Giannotta , Chair of Neurological Surgery at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine , whom Rhimes had consulted in writing for Shepherd 's storylines and patients . </P> <P> In January 2014 , Dempsey signed a two - year contract to remain on Grey 's Anatomy ( then in its tenth season ) that would ensure his presence for potential 11th and 12th seasons . However , in April 2015 , Dempsey 's character was killed off while his contract was not over yet . Dempsey explained : `` it just sort of evolved . It 's just kind of happened . It really was something that was kind of surprising that unfolded , and it just naturally came to be . Which was pretty good . I like the way it has all played out . '' In August 2015 , Rhimes commented : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> The decision to have the character die the way that he did was not a difficult one in the sense of what were the options ? Either Derek was going to walk out on Meredith , and leave her high and dry , and what was that going to mean ? That was going to suggest that the love was not true , the thing we had said for 11 years was a lie and McDreamy was n't McDreamy . For me , that was untenable . Meredith and Derek 's love had to remain Meredith and Derek 's love . As painful as it was for me as a storyteller , because I had never really thought that was going to happen , it preserved what felt true to me , was that Derek was going to have to die in order for that love to remain honest . Because I really could n't have the idea that he just turned out to be a bad guy who walked out on his wife and kids be a true story . To me , it felt like that was the only way to make Meredith and Derek 's magic remain true and forever frozen in time . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The character was later written to be a graduate of Bowdoin College , a liberal arts college in Brunswick , Maine , after an alumnus led a petition signed by over 450 students to `` adopt '' the character as an alumnus . Dempsey is from Lewiston , about 18 miles ( 29 km ) away from Brunswick , and was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bowdoin in 2013 . </P> <H3> Characterization ( edit ) </H3> <P> Rhimes describes Shepherd as typical `` Prince Charming '' . He was planned to be a doctor who does n't really care about anything , who lives in his `` own '' universe and has a big sex appeal . A man who is charming , devilishly handsome and the type of guy every girl dreams of , and a man that often makes the wrong decisions , and is often known as a jerk or the ultimate heartbreaker . Rhimes planned to have this kind of character from the beginning , because he was the kind of guy whom girls fall in love with and a character whose storylines could easily be changed . USA Today writer Robert Bianco said : `` Derek could , at times , seem like two people , warm and funny one minute , cold and self - involved the next . Dempsey 's gift was in making those two sides seem like part of the same person , while keeping us rooting for that person as a whole . '' </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> Dempsey 's relation with Ellen Pompeo ( Meredith Grey ) has been the highlight of the series since its inception . <P> With the show concluding its second season , Robert Bianco of USA Today said that Emmy voters could consider him because of the `` seemingly effortless way he humanizes Derek 's ' dreamy ' appeal with ego and vanity '' . In the third season , Alan Sepinwall of The Star - Ledger wrote that `` the attempt to give the moral high ground back to McDreamy was bad . Dude , whatever happened in New York ceased to count in any kind of grievance tally once you agreed to take Addison back and give things another try . You 're the dick who cheated on her , you 're the one who knew that she found the panties , and still you act like her getting back together with Mark justifies what you did ? Wow . I did n't think it was possible for me to dislike anyone on this show more than Meredith , but congratulations , big guy . '' </P> <P> Debbie Chang of BuddyTV noted the character 's immaturity in the fourth season , saying : `` The only character who did not make me love him was Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) . How this character is still Shonda 's golden child is beyond me . Yes , we get it . He 's tormented by his love for Meredith , but that does not give him the right to lash out at her when his clinical trial patients are dying . If things do n't go absolutely the way he wants them to , then he refuses to cooperate . How immature can this man possibly be ? No amount of heavily styled hair or blue - blue - blue eyes is going to make me warm up to him unless he admits to being the needy , desperate one in the relationship . '' </P> <P> Entertainment Weekly placed Shepherd in its list of the `` 30 Great TV Doctors and Nurses '' . The character was also listed in Wetpaint 's `` 10 Hottest Male Doctors on TV '' and in BuzzFeed 's `` 16 Hottest Doctors On Television '' . His relationship with Meredith was included in TV Guide 's list of `` The Best TV Couples of All Time '' . </P> <P> Victor Balta of Today listed Shepherd and Sloan 's friendship in its `` TV 's best bromances '' . He called them `` the most exciting couple on Grey 's , '' explaining `` they 've demonstrated an easy chemistry that makes for some of the great comic relief around Seattle Grace Hospital with their banter , sage wisdom on each other 's lives , and locker room - style teasing . '' Their bromance was furthermore included in lists by About.com , BuddyTV , Cosmopolitan , Wetpaint . However , following the announcement of Dane 's upcoming departure from the show , Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald felt he and Derek `` never clicked like you 'd expect friends would . Any scene they had together ranged from uncomfortable to forced .

He lives in Brooklyn Heights , New York . Cliff had a brother , James Theodore Huxtable , who died of rheumatic fever at the age of 7 . In his high school and college years , he was an athlete who wrestled , played football , and ran track . He later served in the Navy before going to medical school . He is an OB / GYN who runs a practice from the office annexed to his home . In the show , most characters outside of family and friends refer to him as `` Dr. Huxtable '' , and he is well - respected in the community . </P> <P> Cliff is married to Clair Huxtable . Both Cliff and Clair attended the fictional Hillman College . Together , they have five children : Sondra , Denise , Theodore ( Theo ) , Vanessa , and Rudith ( Rudy ) . Cliff enjoys live jazz , has an extensive collection of albums , and tries to eat junk food whenever he can get away with it . </P> <P> Cliff is very eccentric and silly to most people around him , especially his family , however he is very kind - hearted and an extremely dedicated father with a strong sense of humor . Although he and his wife fostered a tight - knit , loving family , a running gag throughout the series is his thwarted attempts to get the grown children to leave the house . </P> <P> Very playful , Cliff enjoys competition , often making bets with Clair over various things , such as the date a certain jazz song was released , or having a `` Smooth Contest '' to see which of them looked more elegant for a night on the town , as judged by the children . He also plays a monthly game of pinochle against his father and some friends , which sometimes gets very passionate . Unfortunately , Cliff often finds himself on the losing end of most of his bets and games , as , for example , he has never beaten his father - in - law at chess . However , Cliff eventually broke his losing streak at pinochle against his father and his friend Homer Dobson with the help of Dr. Foster ( played by Roscoe Lee Browne ) , an expert pinochle player who also happened to be his and Clair 's literary professor at Hillman College . </P> <P> In the pilot episode , Cosby 's character 's full name is Clifford , as shown on a sign on the exterior of the house . His full name was subsequently changed to Heathcliff , even though in one episode Clair called him `` Heathclifford '' , and he is commonly called `` Cliff '' throughout the series . </P> <P> Originally , Cliff was to have worked as a chauffeur , with most of the humor coming from his interactions with customers . However , the show was changed before airing to have Cliff be a medical doctor , and the humor to come from his interactions with his family . </P> <P> Cliff also appears in three episodes of A Different World : the pilot ( with Rudy ) , `` Rudy and the Snow Queen '' ( also with Rudy ) and `` If Chosen , I May Not Run '' . </P> <P> He is the only character to appear in every episode . </P> <H3> Clair Huxtable </H3> Main article : Clair Huxtable <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Phylicia Rash\u0101d </Td> <Td> All </Td> <Td> 193 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Clair Olivia Huxtable ( n\u00e9e Hanks ) is the elegantly tough , eloquent , and engaging wife of Cliff , who is known for her relaxed confidence and striking emphasis as shown . Aside from her deep and decorated self - expression , Clair can also be playful and silly . She is an intelligent , classy , and successful businesswoman . A great debater , Clair rarely if ever loses an argument on the show , a testament to her career as lawyer . She is also highly skilled in areas of recall about facts and dates , which she uses during discussions and debates : in one episode she is shown quoting a passage and even the page number of a book during an appearance at a television roundtable . Clair is bilingual but is only shown speaking Spanish on a couple of occasions . Several episodes also showcased her singing talent . Despite her elegant brand of toughness and strictness , Clair is a very loving mother and wife . The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's wife , Camille Olivia Hanks - Cosby . </P> <P> Her age is directly stated only once during the series , and two separate episodes provide contradictory information on the age difference between herself and Cliff . He celebrates his 50th birthday during season three ( `` Cliff 's 50th Birthday '' ) , while she celebrates her 46th during season five ( `` Birthday Blues , '' two years later ) , indicating that she is six years younger . However , in the season four episode `` The Locker Room , '' it is stated that Clair is four years younger . </P> <P> Her character was originally supposed to be a housewife , but when the show finally aired , she became a lawyer . During the series , she becomes a partner in her law firm . As an attorney she helps her family with legal issues , and she successfully represents her eldest daughter , Sondra , in a case over dishonest car repairs . When it came to the Huxtable household , she was in charge , even though she let Cliff think he was in charge ( although Cliff was known to lay down the law when he had to ) . She was the chief disciplinarian of the children , as shown in an episode where Vanessa and her friends sneak off to Baltimore to see a rock concert and Clair delivers a memorable and scathing diatribe to her . Another memorable moment came when the normally composed Clair lost her temper when Sondra announced she was n't going to law school after paying her tuition to attend Princeton . </P> <P> Clair also appears in four episodes of A Different World : `` Clair 's Last Stand '' , `` Risky Business '' ( with Theo and Vanessa ) , `` Forever Hold Your Peace '' ( with Martin and Olivia ) and `` Success , Lies and Videotapes '' . </P> <P> Clair Huxtable has been ranked highly in several lists of the top television mothers . She was voted as television 's `` Favorite TV Mom '' in a poll conducted by the Opinion Research Company in 2004 . In 2009 , she was included in the Top 5 Classic TV Moms by Film.com . In May 2012 , Clair was one of the 12 moms chosen by users of iVillage on their list of `` Mommy Dearest : The TV Moms You Love '' . AOL named her the ninth Most Memorable Female TV Character . </P> <H3> Sondra Huxtable Tibideaux </H3> Main article : Sondra Huxtable -- Tibideaux <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> First appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sabrina LeBeauf </Td> <Td> 2 -- 8 ; recurring in 1 </Td> <Td> 53 </Td> <Td> `` Bonjour Sondra '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Sondra Tibideaux ( n\u00e9e Huxtable ) , the eldest daughter of Cliff and Clair , did not appear on screen until mid-way through season one . She did not exist in the pilot episode ( Clair : `` Why do we have four children ? '' Cliff : `` Because we did not want five . '' ) In her first appearance , she is a sophomore in college , and Cliff notes her to be 20 years old ( episode 10 ) , making her birth year 1964 . She earned a degree from Princeton University and had intentions of pursuing a career as a lawyer , like her mother . She married her boyfriend , Elvin Tibideaux , in season four , and later gave birth to twins -- a boy and a girl -- named after Nelson and Winnie Mandela . More serious , earnest and responsible than the other children , Sondra fits many of the characteristics of the first born from a large family . Though she had her moments of bizarre thinking ( e.g. dropping out of law school to open up a wilderness store with Elvin ) , she 'd usually snap out of them relatively quickly . Because of her intelligence level and overachieving nature , she is looked upon by her parents proudly , but also is held to a higher standard than the rest of the children . Sondra appeared sporadically in early seasons of the series due to the character being off at college at the time . </P> <P> Sondra was created when Bill Cosby wanted the show to express the accomplishment of successfully raising a child ( e.g. a college graduate ) . Whitney Houston was considered for the role of Sondra Huxtable . Sabrina LeBeauf almost missed out on the role because she is only 10 years younger ( b . 1958 ) than Phylicia Rashad ( b . 1948 ) . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's eldest daughter , Erika , who was approximately the same age as Sondra . </P> <H3> Denise Huxtable Kendall </H3> Main article : Denise Huxtable -- Kendall <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> Final appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Lisa Bonet </Td> <Td> 1 -- 3 , 6 -- 7 ; recurring in 4&5 </Td> <Td> 119 </Td> <Td> `` Cliff and Jake '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Denise Kendall ( n\u00e9e Huxtable ) is the second daughter of Cliff and Clair Huxtable . At the beginning of the series , she is sixteen years old , putting her year of birth in 1968 . She loves fashion and music , but did not want to attend school to pursue either interest . She is noted as being an individual who usually wishes to march to the beat of her own drum , and often learns lessons up front for herself rather than based off the experiences of others . A two - year stint at Hillman College ends with Denise wishing to see what she can accomplish on her own , which leads her to Africa as a photographer 's assistant . While there , she meets and marries Navy Lt. Martin Kendall , and also becomes stepmother to Martin 's three - year - old daughter Olivia , his child from a previous marriage . Denise eventually decides to become a special education teacher and makes arrangements to attend Medgar Evers College to this effect , but that idea does not work out as Denise eventually leaves New York again when Martin is posted to Singapore on a long - term assignment . It is revealed in the series finale that she is pregnant . </P> <P> During the first two seasons , Denise was portrayed as a very popular high - schooler , with many friends , who seemingly had a different boyfriend every episode . Along with her constantly fluctuating love life , were her various hairstyles and choices of clothing , which were occasionally made fun of by Cliff . In later seasons , however , she exhibited a more flighty nature , often expressing ideas that left Cliff and Clair greatly puzzled . </P> <P> In season three , Denise left home to attend Hillman College , a fictional , historically African - American college , of which her mother , father and grandfather were all alumni . The Cosby Show 's producers created a spin - off series , entitled A Different World , which initially dealt with the life of Denise at college . Denise was written out of the series following its inaugural season ( which aired concurrently with season four of The Cosby Show ) , after actress Lisa Bonet became pregnant . Shortly after the start of season five , Denise traveled to Africa for a year , and there she fell in love with and married Martin . In the season six premiere , she returned home , shocking her parents with the news of her surprise marriage to a divorced single father . However , Cliff and Clair accepted the couple when they met Olivia , who immediately won their hearts and was welcomed into the family . She appears regularly during the first three seasons , and is in only four episodes each of seasons four and five ( a picture of her can be seen in the opening credits of season four ) , she appears regularly in season six , but only appears in a handful of episodes during season seven . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's daughter , Erinn , who was approximately the same age as Denise . Additionally , Denise attended Hillman College , whereas Erinn attended Spelman College , the university that Hillman is believed to be modeled after . </P> <H3> Theo Huxtable </H3> Main article : Theodore Huxtable <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Malcolm - Jamal Warner </Td> <Td> All </Td> <Td> 176 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Theodore Aloysius `` Theo '' Huxtable is the middle child and only son of Cliff and Clair Huxtable , and is athletic and obsessed with impressing girls , and obtaining a sports car or motorcycle . He is fourteen years old when the series begins , making his birth year 1970 . In the pilot episode , he is lectured by his father for not applying himself at school ( `` I brought you in this world , and I 'll take you out '' ) . Also in the early seasons , he was somewhat of a troublemaker , as illustrated through incidents both alluded to and explicitly portrayed in the series , such as letting his best friend 's younger sister pierce his ear , resulting in an infected earlobe , but his behavior had improved by the time he left high school . </P> <P> A running theme of the early seasons revolved around Theo 's academic struggles , especially in his sophomore - year geometry class , taught by Mrs. Westlake ( Sonia Braga ) . As the seasons progressed , Theo gradually evolved from being an under - achiever to a successful high school -- and college -- student ( in interviews , Cosby noted a similar change in his real - life son , Ennis ) . While Theo was a student at NYU , it was revealed that he suffered from dyslexia , a learning disability that inspired him to work harder , and as a result overcame it . By the final season , Theo was a student teacher , helping other children with dyslexia at a local education center . In the show 's final episode , he graduated from NYU with a degree in psychology . </P> <P> In the pilot , and once more in season one ( the episode `` Bad Dreams '' ) , he is referred to by Vanessa as `` Teddy '' , instead of `` Theo . '' </P> <P> Theo has a long - running , but on - and - off relationship with a girl named Justine , who is mentioned many times throughout the series , but appears in only nine episodes . During his high school years , Theo 's best friend was Walter Bradley ( Carl Anthony Payne II ) , better known as `` Cockroach '' , who was more of a scholastic underachiever than Theo . The two of them would occasionally compose rap songs for various school assignments . When Theo got tickets to `` Dance Mania '' ( a `` Soul Train '' - like television dance show ) , and only one of them was allowed into the studio , Theo let Cockroach have the spot , but did not feel good about it when he saw Cockroach on TV , and as the center of their friends ' attention the next day at school . This episode marked the final appearance of the character , and Cockroach was rarely mentioned in subsequent episodes . Theo appears in the series the most out of the Huxtable children . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's only son Ennis , who was approximately the same age as Theo ( and was also dyslexic ) . </P> <P> Theo also appears in two episodes of A Different World : `` My Dinner With Theo '' ( with Rudy ) and `` Risky Business '' ( with Clair and Vanessa ) . </P> <H3> Vanessa Huxtable </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Tempestt Bledsoe </Td> <Td> All </Td> <Td> 157 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Vanessa Huxtable is the fourth child and third daughter of Cliff and Clair . In season one , she is eleven years old , making her birth year 1973 . As Vanessa grew up , she faced typical teenage problems and heartbreaks , such as wearing make - up before her 15th birthday in violation of her parents ' rules and spending a lot of time talking on the phone with her friends . Unlike her older brother , she was an excellent student and seemed to enjoy school ; at the beginning of season seven , she went off to college one year early . She became engaged in the final season to Dabnis Brickey , a man in his late twenties . Dabnis was the head of maintenance at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania , where Vanessa was enrolled . However , Vanessa realized that she was not ready to get married , and they broke off the engagement . They maintained they were `` just friends '' by the end of the season . </P> <P> In the early seasons , Vanessa is usually considered to be nosy , as she usually -- sneakily -- tries to find out what goes on in the Huxtable house , especially when it involves someone ( usually Theo ) in trouble with their parents . But , in a later episode , the tables are turned , as Theo catches Vanessa 's friends smoking cigarettes in her room , although Vanessa herself did not take part , and even tried to dissuade her friends from doing so . </P> <P> She often fought with her younger sister , Rudy , over typical childish issues . At one point , their fighting caused damage to both their bedrooms and the kitchen ceiling , driving Cliff to declare their rooms off limits because of `` World War Five '' and exile them to the basement until repairs were finished . But , on one occasion , Vanessa got into a physical tussle with Denise over a sweater that Vanessa stole from Denise 's closet after Denise did not allow her to borrow it . </P> <P> One of Vanessa 's best friends in high school was a girl named Kara ( played by Elizabeth Narvaez ) , who could ramble on about nothing in particular at high speed . Whenever Cliff -- who once referred to Kara as `` Turbo Tongue '' -- was on the receiving end of her babbling , he would always reply with a bewildered `` Thank you . '' Vanessa appeared sporadically in the final two seasons of the series due to the character being away at college . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's daughter , Ensa , who was approximately the same age as Vanessa . </P> <P> Vanessa also appears in the A Different World episode `` Risky Business '' ( with Clair and Theo ) . </P> <H3> Rudy Huxtable </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Keshia Knight Pulliam </Td> <Td> All </Td> <Td> 177 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Rudith Lillian `` Rudy '' Huxtable is the youngest of the Huxtable children . She is only five years old at the beginning of the series , making her birth year 1979 . She comes of age during the course of the show . </P> <P> A number of Rudy 's friends appear in episodes as the series progresses . Among the best known are the taciturn Peter Chiara who repeatedly ran out the Huxtables ' front door when frightened ; and the chauvinist , blues - loving Kenny , whom she nicknames `` Bud '' , and who always gets advice from his ( unseen ) older brother about basically everything . This unfortunately gives him the wrong conception about certain things and gets him in trouble , although he seemed to grow out of it as the series reached its end . </P> <P> Keshia Knight Pulliam was nominated for an Emmy for her performance in season two , becoming the youngest nominee ever . One of her fellow nominees that year was Phylicia Rashad . Neither won . </P> <P> The Huxtable family was originally going to be two boys and two girls . The youngest child , Rudy , was initially supposed to be a boy , but the character was re-written for a girl ( Keshia Knight Pulliam ) when no boys auditioned . Jaleel White , later known for his role as Steve Urkel on Family Matters , revealed in a 2011 interview with Vanity Fair that he had auditioned for the role of Rudy . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's youngest daughter , Evin , who was approximately the same age as Rudy . </P> <P> Rudy also appears in three episodes of A Different World : the pilot ( with Cliff ) , `` Rudy and the Snow Queen '' ( also with Cliff ) and `` My Dinner with Theo '' ( with Theo ) . </P> <H3> Elvin Tibideaux </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> First appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Geoffrey Owens </Td> <Td> 4 -- 8 ; recurring in 2&3 </Td> <Td> 44 </Td> <Td> `` Cliff in Love '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Elvin Tibideaux is Sondra 's boyfriend , and later , husband . They met at Princeton , where they both earned degrees . The two constantly bickered during early episodes , until his interactions with the Huxtables , particularly Clair , challenged him to confront his `` male - chauvinist '' attitudes . </P> <P> When they return from their honeymoon , they shock Cliff and Clair by announcing their intentions to forego medical school and law school , and start a wilderness supply store in Brooklyn . When his children are born , Elvin then announces that he will re-apply to medical school . This decision later convinces Sondra to resume her studies at law school . </P> <P> Elvin was a wrestler in high school and for one year at Princeton , but had to quit after injuring his hip . During season three , he helped Theo with some strategy and moves . </P> <H3> Martin Kendall </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> First appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Joseph C.

Martin Kendall is a Navy officer , husband of Denise Huxtable , and father of Olivia . Phillips ' role as Martin Kendall came about when Denise unexpectedly married him in Africa , unbeknownst to her parents and family . When the newlyweds arrive back home , Martin learns that Denise 's family not only does not know about their marriage , they do not know about him at all , so he wants to introduce himself to the Huxtables now that he has married into their family and to show his intentions of marrying his daughter were honorable . This does not go over smoothly at first , as Clair and Cliff are uneasy with the whirlwind marriage of Martin , however in due time they become accustomed to this blended family . Kendall also had an ex-wife , named Paula ( played by Victoria Rowell of The Young and the Restless ) . In the finale , it is revealed that he and Denise are expecting a baby together . </P> <P> Joseph C. Phillips played Sondra 's date in a season two episode , before coming back as a new character , and playing the husband of Denise . Martin appears frequently in the sixth season but is only seen in a handful episodes of the seventh season , Joseph C. Phillips 's final season as a regular . Martin makes his final appearance in an episode of season eight , `` Olivia Comes Out of the Closet .

Olivia is the only child of Martin and Paula Kendall . After a few years of marriage , her parents divorced , and her mother , Paula , gave Martin full custody , as she felt overwhelmed by marriage and motherhood . Olivia was then raised by her grandparents and father . </P> <P> When Olivia was almost four years old , her father Martin married Denise Huxtable , whom he met in Africa . The new family moved in with Denise 's parents , Clair and Cliff Huxtable , who are now Olivia 's step - grandparents . Martin , as a Naval officer , is required to travel a lot , so for a while , Olivia was unable to spend time with him . During his absences , her stepmother , Denise , raised her . Olivia continued to live with her step - grandparents while her parents were in Singapore during the final season . </P> <P> The character was named after Bill Cosby 's wife , Camille Olivia Hanks - Cosby . </P> <P> Olivia also appears in the Different World episode `` Forever Hold Your Peace '' ( with Clair and Martin ) . </P> <H3> Pam Tucker </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> First appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Erika Alexander </Td> <Td> 7 -- 8 </Td> <Td> 21 </Td> <Td> `` Period of Adjustment '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Pam Tucker is Clair Huxtable 's distant cousin .

Rowling . The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard , Harry Potter , and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley , all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . The main story arc concerns Harry 's struggle against Lord Voldemort , a dark wizard who intends to become immortal , overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic , and subjugate all wizards and Muggles ( non-magical people ) . </P> <P> Since the release of the first novel , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , on 26 June 1997 , the books have found immense popularity , critical acclaim , and commercial success worldwide . They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers , and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature . The series has also had its share of criticism , including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed , as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts . As of February 2018 , the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide , making them the best - selling book series in history , and have been translated into eighty languages . The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest - selling books in history , with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty - four hours of its release . </P> <P> The series was originally published in English by two major publishers , Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States . A play , Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , based on a story co-written by Rowling , premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre , and its script was published by Little , Brown . The original seven books were adapted into an eight - part film series by Warner Bros. Pictures , which is the third highest - grossing film series of all time as of February 2018 . In 2016 , the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion , making Harry Potter one of the highest - grossing media franchises of all time . </P> <P> A series of many genres , including fantasy , drama , coming of age , and the British school story ( which includes elements of mystery , thriller , adventure , horror , and romance ) , the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references . According to Rowling , the main theme is death . Other major themes in the series include prejudice , corruption , and madness . </P> <P> The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand , with numerous derivative works , a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009 , a studio tour in London that opened in 2012 , a digital platform on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight , and a pentalogy of spin - off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , among many other developments . Most recently , themed attractions , collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter , have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early years </Li> <Li> 1.2 Voldemort returns </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Supplementary works <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Harry Potter and the Cursed Child </Li> <Li> 2.2 In - universe books </Li> <Li> 2.3 Pottermore website </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Structure and genre </Li> <Li> 4 Themes </Li> <Li> 5 Origins </Li> <Li> 6 Publishing history <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Translations </Li> <Li> 6.2 Completion of the series </Li> <Li> 6.3 Cover art </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Achievements <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Cultural impact </Li> <Li> 7.2 Commercial success </Li> <Li> 7.3 Awards , honours , and recognition </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Reception <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Literary criticism </Li> <Li> 8.2 Social impact </Li> <Li> 8.3 Controversies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 Adaptations <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Films <Ul> <Li> 9.1. 1 Spin - off prequels </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.2 Games </Li> <Li> 9.3 Audiobooks </Li> <Li> 9.4 Stage production </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Attractions <Ul> <Li> 10.1 The Wizarding World of Harry Potter </Li> <Li> 10.2 The Making of Harry Potter </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 Further reading </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Plot </H2> Further information : Fictional universe of Harry Potter <P> The central character in the series is Harry Potter , a boy who lives in Surrey with his aunt , uncle , and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers , at the age of eleven , that he is a wizard , though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles . The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world , albeit hidden and in secrecy . His magical ability is inborn , and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world . Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , a wizarding academy in Scotland , and it is here where most of the events in the series take place . As Harry develops through his adolescence , he learns to overcome the problems that face him : magical , social , and emotional , including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships , infatuation , romantic relationships , schoolwork and exams , anxiety , depression , stress , and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain 's increasingly - violent second wizarding war . </P> <P> Each novel chronicles one year in Harry 's life during the period from 1991 to 1998 . The books also contain many flashbacks , which are frequently experienced by Harry viewing the memories of other characters in a device called a Pensieve . </P> <P> The environment Rowling created is intimately connected to reality . The British magical community of the Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture , European folklore , classical mythology and alchemy , incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands , magic plants , potions , spells , flying broomsticks , centaurs and other magical creatures , the Deathly Hallows , and the Philosopher 's Stone , beside others invented by Rowling . While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternate universe and the Lord of the Rings ' Middle - earth a mythic past , the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists in parallel within the real world and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life , with the action mostly set in Scotland ( Hogwarts ) , the West Country , Devon , London , and Surrey in southeast England . The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets , ancient pubs , lonely country manors , and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population . </P> <H3> Early years </H3> <P> When the first novel of the series , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone ) opens , it is apparent that some significant event has taken place in the wizarding world -- an event so very remarkable , even Muggles ( non-magical people ) notice signs of it . The full background to this event and Harry Potter 's past is revealed gradually throughout the series . After the introductory chapter , the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter 's eleventh birthday , and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed . </P> <P> Despite Harry 's aunt and uncle 's desperate prevention of Harry learning about his abilities , their efforts are in vain . Harry meets a half - giant , Rubeus Hagrid , who is also his first contact with the wizarding world . Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts as well as some of Harry 's history . Harry learns that , as a baby , he witnessed his parents ' murder by the power - obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort , who subsequently attempted to kill him as well . Instead , the unexpected happened : Harry survived with only a lightning - shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack , and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards , gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse . As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort 's reign of terror , Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world . However , at the orders of the venerable and well - known wizard Albus Dumbledore , the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives , the Dursleys , who have kept him safe but treated him poorly , including confining him to a cupboard without meals and treating as their servant . Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years , from age eleven to seventeen . </P> <P> With Hagrid 's help , Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts . As Harry begins to explore the magical world , the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series . Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends : Ron Weasley , a fun - loving member of an ancient , large , happy , but poor wizarding family , and Hermione Granger , a gifted , bright , and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage . Harry also encounters the school 's potions master , Severus Snape , who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him , the rich brat Draco Malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with , and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher , Quirinus Quirrell , who later turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort . He also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house 's Quidditch team , a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks . The first book concludes with Harry 's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort , who , in his quest to regain a body , yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher 's Stone , a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold . </P> <P> The series continues with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , describing Harry 's second year at Hogwarts . He and his friends investigate a 50 - year - old mystery that appears uncannily related to recent sinister events at the school . Ron 's younger sister , Ginny Weasley , enrolls in her first year at Hogwarts , and finds an old notebook in her belongings which turns out to be an alumnus 's diary , Tom Marvolo Riddle , later revealed to be Voldemort 's younger self , who is bent on ridding the school of `` mudbloods '' , a derogatory term describing wizards and witches of non-magical parentage . The memory of Tom Riddle resides inside of the diary and when Ginny begins to confide in the diary , Voldemort is able to possess her . Through the diary , Ginny acts on Voldemort 's orders and unconsciously opens the `` Chamber of Secrets '' , unleashing an ancient monster , later revealed to be a basilisk , which begins attacking students at Hogwarts . It kills those who make direct eye contact with it and petrifies those who look at it indirectly . The book also introduces a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher , Gilderoy Lockhart , a highly cheerful , self - conceited wizard with a pretentious facade , later turning out to be a fraud . Harry discovers that prejudice exists in the Wizarding World through delving into the school 's history , and learns that Voldemort 's reign of terror was often directed at wizards and witches who were descended from Muggles . Harry also learns about the innate ability of his to speak the snake language Parseltongue is rare and often associated with the Dark Arts . When Hermione is attacked and petrified , Harry and Ron finally piece together the puzzles and unlock the Chamber of Secrets , with Harry destroying the diary for good and saving Ginny , and also destroying a part of Voldemort 's soul . The end of the book reveals Lucius Malfoy , Draco 's father and rival of Ron and Ginny 's father , to be the culprit who slipped the book into Ginny 's belongings and introduced the diary into Hogwarts . </P> <P> The third novel , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , follows Harry in his third year of magical education . It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form . Instead , Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by Sirius Black , his father 's best friend , and , according to the Wizarding World , an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry 's parents . As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors -- dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair -- which are ostensibly protecting the school , he reaches out to Remus Lupin , a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf . Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age . Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend , Peter Pettigrew , who had been hiding as Ron 's pet rat , Scabbers . In this book , a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised -- in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher , none of whom lasts more than one school year . </P> <H3> Voldemort returns </H3> The Elephant House was one of the caf\u00e9s in Edinburgh where Rowling wrote the first part of Harry Potter . <P> During Harry 's fourth year of school ( detailed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ) , Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament , a dangerous yet exciting contest where three `` champions '' , one from each participating school , must compete with each other in three tasks in order to win the Triwizard Cup . This year , Harry must compete against a witch and a wizard `` champion '' from overseas visiting schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , as well as another Hogwarts student , causing Harry 's friends to distance themselves from him . Harry is guided through the tournament by their new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor , Alastor `` Mad - Eye '' Moody , who turns out to be an impostor -- one of Voldemort 's supporters named Barty Crouch , Jr. in disguise . The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series ' shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict . Voldemort 's plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds . Although Harry manages to escape , Cedric Diggory , the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament , is killed by Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort re-enters the Wizarding World with a physical body . </P> <P> In the fifth book , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort . In response to Voldemort 's reappearance , Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix , a secret society which works from Sirius Black 's dark family home to defeat Voldemort 's minions and protect Voldemort 's targets , especially Harry . Despite Harry 's description of Voldemort 's recent activities , the Ministry of Magic and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned . In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore , who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World attempting to warn of Voldemort 's return , the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher . She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic . </P> <P> With Ron and Hermione 's suggestion , Harry forms `` Dumbledore 's Army '' , a secret study group aimed to teach his classmates the higher - level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned from his previous encounters with Dark wizards . Through those lessons , Harry begins to develop a crush on the popular and attractive Cho Chang . Juggling schoolwork , Umbridge 's incessant and persistent efforts to land him in trouble and the defensive lessons , Harry begins to lose sleep as he constantly receives disturbing dreams about a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic , followed by a burning desire . An important prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort is then revealed , and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful connection , allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort 's actions telepathically . In the novel 's climax , Harry is tricked into seeing Sirius tortured and races to the Ministry of Magic . He and his friends face off against Voldemort 's followers ( nicknamed Death Eaters ) at the Ministry of Magic . Although the timely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers ' lives , Sirius Black is killed in the conflict . </P> <P> In the sixth book , Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , Voldemort begins waging open warfare . Harry and his friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts . They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence -- Harry eventually begins dating Ginny , Ron establishes a strong infatuation with fellow Hogwarts student Lavender Brown , and Hermione starts to develop romantic feelings towards Ron . Near the beginning of the novel , lacking his own book , Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with many annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer titled ; `` the Half - Blood Prince . '' This book is a source of scholastic success and great recognition from their new potions master , Horace Slughorn , but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it , becomes a source of concern . With war drawing near , Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore , who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort in a device called a Pensieve . These reveal that in order to preserve his life , Voldemort has split his soul into pieces , creating a series of Horcruxes -- evil enchanted items hidden in various locations , one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book . On their way to collect a Horcrux , Draco , who has joined with the Death Eaters , attempts to attack Dumbledore , and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape , the titular Half - Blood Prince . </P> <P> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , the last original novel in the series , begins directly after the events of the sixth book . Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic . Harry , Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort 's remaining Horcruxes . To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends , they are forced to isolate themselves . A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease , Harry and the Dursleys separate , and Hermione wipes her parents ' memories . As they search for the Horcruxes , the trio learns details about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows , three legendary items that when united under one Keeper , would supposedly grant that person to be the Master of Death . Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one of those items , and Voldemort to be searching for another : the Elder Wand , the most powerful wand in history . At the end of the book , Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore 's past , as well as Snape 's true motives -- he had worked on Dumbledore 's behalf since the murder of Harry 's mother . Eventually , Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia . </P> <P> The book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts . Harry , Ron and Hermione , in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students , defend Hogwarts from Voldemort , his Death Eaters , and various dangerous magical creatures . Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle , including Remus Lupin and Fred Weasley , Ron 's older brother . After learning that he himself is a Horcrux , Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest , who casts a killing curse ( Avada Kedavra ) at him . The defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning of Harry 's presumed death and continue to fight on . Harry awakens and faces Voldemort , whose Horcruxes have all been destroyed . In the final battle , Voldemort 's killing curse rebounds off Harry 's defensive spell ( Expelliarmus ) , killing Voldemort . </P> <P> An epilogue `` Nineteen Years Later '' ( set on 1 September 2017 ) describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects of Voldemort 's death on the Wizarding World . In the epilogue , Harry and Ginny are married with three children , and Ron and Hermione are married with two children . </P> <H2> Supplementary works </H2> <H3> Harry Potter and the Cursed Child </H3> Main article : Harry Potter and the Cursed Child <P> Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a two - part West End stage play . It was written by Jack Thorne , based on a story by J.K. Rowling , Thorne and director John Tiffany . The play opened on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre , London , England . The script was released on 31 July 2016 . The story is set nineteen years after the ending of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and follows Harry Potter , now a Ministry of Magic employee , and his youngest son Albus Severus Potter . The play 's official synopsis was released on 23 October 2015 : </P> <P> It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it is n't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic , a husband , and father of three school - age children . </P> <P> While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs , his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted . As past and present fuse ominously , both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth : sometimes , darkness comes from unexpected places . </P> <H3> In - universe books </H3> See also : J.K. Rowling \u00a7 Philanthropy <P> Rowling has expanded the Harry Potter universe with several short books produced for various charities . In 2001 , she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ( a purported Hogwarts textbook ) and Quidditch Through the Ages ( a book Harry reads for fun ) . Proceeds from the sale of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief . In 2007 , Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard , a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel , one of which was auctioned to raise money for the Children 's High Level Group , a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries . The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008 . Rowling also wrote an 800 - word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones . All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels . </P> <P> In 2016 , she released three new e-books : Hogwarts : An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide , Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power , Politics and Pesky Poltergeists and Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism , Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies . </P> <H3> Pottermore website </H3> <P> In 2011 , Rowling launched a new website announcing an upcoming project called Pottermore . Pottermore opened to the general public on 14 April 2012 . Pottermore allows users to be sorted , be chosen by their wand and play various minigames . The main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey though the story with access to content not revealed by JK Rowling previously , with over 18,000 words of additional content . </P> <P> In September 2015 , the website was completely overhauled and most of the features were removed . The site has been redesigned and it mainly focuses on the information already available , rather than exploration . </P> <H2> Structure and genre </H2> <P> The Harry Potter novels are mainly directed at a young adult audience as opposed to an audience of middle grade readers , children , or adults . The novels fall within the genre of fantasy literature , and qualify as a type of fantasy called `` urban fantasy '' , `` contemporary fantasy '' , or `` low fantasy '' . They are mainly dramas , and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout , though they do contain some notable instances of tragicomedy and black humour . In many respects , they are also examples of the bildungsroman , or coming of age novel , and contain elements of mystery , adventure , horror , thriller , and romance . The books are also , in the words of Stephen King , `` shrewd mystery tales '' , and each book is constructed in the manner of a Sherlock Holmes - style mystery adventure . The stories are told from a third person limited point of view with very few exceptions ( such as the opening chapters of Philosopher 's Stone , Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows and the first two chapters of Half - Blood Prince ) . </P> <P> The series can be considered part of the British children 's boarding school genre , which includes Rudyard Kipling 's Stalky & Co. , Enid Blyton 's Malory Towers , St. Clare 's and the Naughtiest Girl series , and Frank Richards 's Billy Bunter novels : the Harry Potter books are predominantly set in Hogwarts , a fictional British boarding school for wizards , where the curriculum includes the use of magic . In this sense they are `` in a direct line of descent from Thomas Hughes 's Tom Brown 's School Days and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of British public school life '' , though they are , as many note , more contemporary , grittier , darker , and more mature than the typical boarding school novel , addressing serious themes of death , love , loss , prejudice , coming - of - age , and the loss of innocence in a 1990s British setting . </P> <P> The Harry Potter stories feature much medieval imagery and motifs drawn from the King Arthur stories . Hogwarts resembles a medieval university - cum - castle with several professors who belonging to an Order of Merlin ; Old Professor Binns still lectures about the International Warlock Convention of 1289 ; and a real historical person , a 14th century scribe Sir Nicolas Flamel , described as a holder of the Philosopher 's Stone . Other medieval elements in Hogwarts include coats - of - arms and medieval weapons on the walls , letters written on parchment and sealed with wax , the Great Hall of Hogwarts which is similar to the Great Hall of Camelot , the use of Latin phrases , the tents put up for Quidditch tournaments are similar to the `` marvelous tents '' put up for knightly tournaments , imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns which exist around Hogwarts , and the banners with heraldic animals for the four Houses of Hogwarts . Many of the motifs of the Potter stories such as the hero 's quest invoking objects that confer invisibility , magical animals and trees , a forest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars are drawn from medieval French Arthurian romances . Other aspects borrowed from French Arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers , werewolves as characters , and white deer . The American scholars Heather Arden and Kathrn Lorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the Potter stories are inspired by a 14th century French Arthurian romance , Claris et Laris , writing of the `` startling '' similarities between the adventures of Potter and the knight Claris . Arden and Lorenz noted that Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1986 with a degree in French literature and spent a year living in France afterwards . </P> <P> Arnden and Lorenz wrote about the similarity between the Arthurian romances , where Camelot is a place of wonder and safety , and from the heroic knights must venture forth facing various perils , usually in an enchanted forest ; and Hogwarts , likewise a wondrous safe place , where Harry Potter and friends must periodically venture forth from to the magical forest that surrounds Hogwarts . In the same way that knights in the Arthurian romances usually have a female helper , who is very intelligent and has a connection with nature , Harry has Hermione who plays a similar role . Like an Arthurian knight , Harry receives advice and encouragement from his mentor , Albus Dumbldore , who resembles both Merlin and King Arthur , but must vanquish his foes alone . Arnden and Lorenz wrote that with Rowling 's books , the characters are `` ... not a simple reworking of the well - known heroes of romance , but a protean melding of different characters to form new ones ... '' . However , Lorenz and Arnden argue the main inspiration for Harry Potter was Sir Percival , one of the Knights of the Round Table who searches for the Holy Grail . Both Potter and Sir Percival had an `` orphaned or semi-orphaned youth , with inherent nobility and powers '' , being raised by relatives who tried to keep them away from the places where they really belong , Hogwarts and Camelot respectively . Both Percival and Potter are however outsiders in the places that they belong , unfamiliar with the rules of knighthood and magic , but both show extraordinary natural abilities with Percival proving himself an exceptional fighter while Potter is an excellent player of Quidditch . And finally , both Percival and Potter found love and acceptance from surrogate families , in the form of the Knights of the Round Table and the Weasley family respectively . </P> <P> Each of the seven books is set over the course of one school year . Harry struggles with the problems he encounters , and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules . If students are caught breaking rules , they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors . The stories reach their climax in the summer term , near or just after final exams , when events escalate far beyond in - school squabbles and struggles , and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers , the Death Eaters , with the stakes a matter of life and death -- a point underlined , as the series progresses , by characters being killed in each of the final four books . In the aftermath , he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore . The only exception to this school - centred setting is the final novel , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts , and only return there to face Voldemort at the d\u00e9nouement . </P> <H2> Themes </H2> <P> According to Rowling , a major theme in the series is death : `` My books are largely about death . They open with the death of Harry 's parents . There is Voldemort 's obsession with conquering death and his quest for immortality at any price , the goal of anyone with magic . I so understand why Voldemort wants to conquer death . We 're all frightened of it . '' </P> <P> Rowling stated that `` Harry Potter books have always , in fact , dealt explicitly with religious themes and questions '' and that she did not reveal its Christian parallels in the beginning because doing so would have `` give ( n ) too much away to fans who might then see the parallels . '' In the final book of the series Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Rowling makes the book 's Christian imagery more explict , quoting both Matthew 6 : 19 and 1 Corinthians 15 : 26 when Harry visits his parents ' graves . Hermione Granger teaches Harry Potter that the meaning of these verses from the Christian Bible are `` living beyond death . Living after death '' , which Rowling states is `` one of the central foundations of resurrection theology '' and that these bible verses `` epitomize the whole series '' . </P> <P> Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books , some more complex than others , and some including political subtexts . Themes such as normality , oppression , survival , and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series . Similarly , the theme of making one 's way through adolescence and `` going over one 's most harrowing ordeals -- and thus coming to terms with them '' has also been considered . Rowling has stated that the books comprise `` a prolonged argument for tolerance , a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry '' and that they also pass on a message to `` question authority and ... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth '' . </P> <P> While the books could be said to comprise many other themes , such as power / abuse of power , violence and hatred , love , loss , prejudice , and free choice , they are , as Rowling states , `` deeply entrenched in the whole plot '' ; the writer prefers to let themes `` grow organically '' , rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers . Along the same lines is the ever - present theme of adolescence , in whose depiction Rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters ' sexualities and not leaving Harry , as she put it , `` stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence '' . Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction of the ways in which death and violence affects youth , and humanity as a whole . </P> <P> Rowling said that , to her , the moral significance of the tales seems `` blindingly obvious '' . The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy , `` because that ... is how tyranny is started , with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble . '' </P> <H2> Origins </H2> Main article : Harry Potter influences and analogues <P> In 1990 , Rowling was on a crowded train from Manchester to London when the idea for Harry suddenly `` fell into her head '' . Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying : </P> <P> `` I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before . I simply sat and thought , for four ( delayed train ) hours , and all the details bubbled up in my brain , and this scrawny , black - haired , bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me . '' </P> <P> Rowling completed Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone in 1995 and the manuscript was sent off to several prospective agents . The second agent she tried , Christopher Little , offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to Bloomsbury . </P> <H2> Publishing history </H2> The novelist , J.K. Rowling The logo used in British , Australian , and Canadian editions before 2010 , which uses the typeface Cochin Bold . <P> After eight other publishers had rejected Philosopher 's Stone , Bloomsbury offered Rowling a \u00a3 2,500 advance for its publication . Despite Rowling 's statement that she did not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books , the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven . On the eve of publishing , Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender - neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group , fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman . She elected to use J.K. Rowling ( Joanne Kathleen Rowling ) , using her grandmother 's name as her second name because she has no middle name . </P> <P> Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone was published by Bloomsbury , the publisher of all Harry Potter books in the United Kingdom , on 26 June 1997 . It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by Scholastic -- the American publisher of the books -- as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone , after Rowling had received US $105,000 for the American rights -- a record amount for a children 's book by an unknown author . Fearing that American readers would not associate the word `` philosopher '' with magic ( although the Philosopher 's Stone is an ancient tradition in alchemy ) , Scholastic insisted that the book be given the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone for the American market . </P> <P> The second book , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999 . Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999 . Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic . Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series , at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version . It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003 . Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005 ; it sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release . The seventh and final novel , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , was published on 21 July 2007 . The book sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of release , breaking down to 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US . </P> <H3> Translations </H3> Main article : Harry Potter in translation The Russian translation of The Deathly Hallows goes on sale in Moscow , 2007 <P> The series has been translated into 80 languages , placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history . The books have seen translations to diverse languages such as Korean , Armenian , Ukrainian , Arabic , Urdu , Hindi , Bengali , Bulgarian , Welsh , Afrikaans , Albanian , Latvian , Vietnamese and Hawaiian . The first volume has been translated into Latin and even Ancient Greek , making it the longest published work in Ancient Greek since the novels of Heliodorus of Emesa in the 3rd century AD . The second volume has also been translated into Latin . </P> <P> Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well - known authors before their work on Harry Potter , such as Viktor Golyshev , who oversaw the Russian translation of the series ' fifth book . The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay , a popular literary critic and cultural commentator . For reasons of secrecy , translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English , leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available . This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries ; for example , such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English - language book ever to top the best - seller list in France . </P> <P> The United States editions were adapted into American English to make them more understandable to a young American audience . </P> <H3> Completion of the series </H3> <P> In December 2005 , Rowling stated on her web site , `` 2006 will be the year when I write the final book in the Harry Potter series . '' Updates then followed in her online diary chronicling the progress of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , with the release date of 21 July 2007 . The book itself was finished on 11 January 2007 in the Balmoral Hotel , Edinburgh , where she scrawled a message on the back of a bust of Hermes . It read : `` J.K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room ( 552 ) on 11 January 2007 . '' </P> <P> Rowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book ( in fact , the epilogue ) was completed `` in something like 1990 '' . In June 2006 , Rowling , on an appearance on the British talk show Richard & Judy , announced that the chapter had been modified as one character `` got a reprieve '' and two others who previously survived the story had in fact been killed . On 28 March 2007 , the cover art for the Bloomsbury Adult and Child versions and the Scholastic version were released . </P> <P> In September 2012 , Rowling mentioned in an interview that she might go back to make a `` director 's cut '' of two of the existing Harry Potter books . </P> <H3> Cover art </H3> <P> For cover art , Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design , with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express , and a title in the font Cochin Bold . The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic , illustrating scenes from the books . These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft . </P> <P> Due to the appeal of the books among an adult audience , Bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an ' adult ' style . These initially used black - and - white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books ( including a very American Hogwarts Express ) without depicting people , but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin 's locket on the cover of the final book . </P> <P> International and later editions have been created by a range of designers , including Mary GrandPr\u00e9 for U.S. audiences and Mika Launis in Finland . For a later American release , Kazu Kibuishi created covers in a somewhat anime - influenced style . </P> <H2> Achievements </H2> `` Platform 93\u20444 '' sign on London King 's Cross railway station <H3> Cultural impact </H3> Further information : Harry Potter fandom <P> Fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books , beginning with the 2000 publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . The events , commonly featuring mock sorting , games , face painting , and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours . </P> <P> The final book in the series , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows became the fastest selling book in history , moving 11 million units in the first twenty - four hours of release . The series has also gathered adult fans , leading to the release of two editions of each Harry Potter book , identical in text but with one edition 's cover artwork aimed at children and the other aimed at adults . Besides meeting online through blogs , podcasts , and fansites , Harry Potter super-fans can also meet at Harry Potter symposia . </P> <P> The word Muggle has spread beyond its Harry Potter origins , becoming one of few pop culture words to land in the Oxford English Dictionary . The Harry Potter fandom has embraced podcasts as a regular , often weekly , insight to the latest discussion in the fandom . Both MuggleCast and PotterCast have reached the top spot of iTunes podcast rankings and have been polled one of the top 50 favourite podcasts . </P> <P> Some lessons identified in the series include diversity , acceptance , political tolerance , and equality . Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different than those who had not . Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant , more opposed to violence and torture , less authoritarian , and less cynical . Although it is not known if this is a cause - and - effect relationship , there is a clear correlation , and it seems that Harry Potter 's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond . </P> <P> Many fan fiction and fan art works about Harry Potter have been made . In March 2007 , `` Harry Potter '' was the most commonly searched fan fiction subject on the internet . At the University of Michigan in 2009 , StarKid Productions performed an original musical parodying the Harry Potter series called A Very Potter Musical . The musical was awarded Entertainment Weekly 's 10 Best Viral Videos of 2009 . </P> <P> The sport Quidditch , played by characters in the Harry Potter series , was created in 2005 and is played worldwide . Characters and elements from the series have inspired scientific names of several organisms , including the dinosaur Dracorex hogwartsia , the spider Eriovixia gryffindori , the wasp Ampulex dementor , and the crab Harryplax severus . </P> <H3> Commercial success </H3> See also : List of best - selling books Crowd outside a book store for the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince . <P> The popularity of the Harry Potter series has translated into substantial financial success for Rowling , her publishers , and other Harry Potter related license holders . This success has made Rowling the first and thus far only billionaire author . The books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide and have also given rise to the popular film adaptations produced by Warner Bros. , all of which have been highly successful in their own right . The films have in turn spawned eight video games and have led to the licensing of more than 400 additional Harry Potter products . The Harry Potter brand has been estimated to be worth as much as $25 billion . </P> <P> The great demand for Harry Potter books motivated The New York Times to create a separate best - seller list for children 's literature in 2000 , just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . By 24 June 2000 , Rowling 's novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks ; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best - seller list . On 12 April 2007 , Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record , with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site . For the release of Goblet of Fire , 9,000 FedEx trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book . Together , Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book . In the United States , the book 's initial printing run was 3.8 million copies . This record statistic was broken by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , with 8.5 million , which was then shattered by Half - Blood Prince with 10.8 million copies . 6.9 million copies of Prince were sold in the U.S. within the first 24 hours of its release ; in the United Kingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day . The initial U.S. print run for Deathly Hallows was 12 million copies , and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble . </P> <H3> Awards , honours , and recognition </H3> <P> The Harry Potter series has been recognised by a host of awards since the initial publication of Philosopher 's Stone including four Whitaker Platinum Book Awards ( all of which were awarded in 2001 ) , three Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prizes ( 1997 -- 1999 ) , two Scottish Arts Council Book Awards ( 1999 and 2001 ) , the inaugural Whitbread children 's book of the year award ( 1999 ) , the WHSmith book of the year ( 2006 ) , among others . In 2000 , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel , and in 2001 , Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire won said award . Honours include a commendation for the Carnegie Medal ( 1997 ) , a short listing for the Guardian Children 's Award ( 1998 ) , and numerous listings on the notable books , editors ' Choices , and best books lists of the American Library Association , The New York Times , Chicago Public Library , and Publishers Weekly . </P> <P> In 2002 , British sociologist Andrew Blake named Harry Potter among the icons of British popular culture along with the likes of James Bond and Sherlock Holmes . In 2003 , four of the books were named in the top 24 of the BBC 's The Big Read survey of the best loved novels in the UK . A 2004 study found that books in the series were commonly read aloud in elementary schools in San Diego County , California . Based on a 2007 online poll , the U.S. National Education Association listed the series in its `` Teachers ' Top 100 Books for Children '' . Three of the books placed among the `` Top 100 Chapter Books '' of all time , or children 's novels , in a 2012 survey published by School Library Journal : Sorcerer 's Stone ranked number three , Prisoner of Azkaban 12th , and Goblet of Fire 98th . In 2012 , the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London featured a 100 - foot tall rendition of Lord Voldemort in a segment designed to show off the UK 's cultural icons . </P> <H2> Reception </H2> <H3> Literary criticism </H3> <P> Early in its history , Harry Potter received positive reviews . On publication , the first book , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , attracted attention from the Scottish newspapers , such as The Scotsman , which said it had `` all the makings of a classic '' , and The Glasgow Herald , which called it `` Magic stuff '' . Soon the English newspapers joined in , with more than one comparing it to Roald Dahl 's work : The Mail on Sunday rated it as `` the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl '' , a view echoed by The Sunday Times ( `` comparisons to Dahl are , this time , justified '' ) , while The Guardian called it `` a richly textured novel given lift - off by an inventive wit '' . </P> <P> By the time of the release of the fifth book , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars . Yale professor , literary scholar , and critic Harold Bloom raised criticisms of the books ' literary merits , saying , `` Rowling 's mind is so governed by clich\u00e9s and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing . '' A.S. Byatt authored an op - ed article in The New York Times calling Rowling 's universe a `` secondary secondary world , made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children 's literature ... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons , and the exaggerated ( more exciting , not threatening ) mirror - worlds of soaps , reality TV and celebrity gossip '' . </P> <P> Michael Rosen , a novelist and poet , advocated the books were not suited for children , who would be unable to grasp the complex themes . Rosen also stated that `` J.K. Rowling is more of an adult writer . '' The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards . His overall view of the series was negative -- `` the Potter saga was essentially patronising , conservative , highly derivative , dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain '' , and he speaks of `` a pedestrian , ungrammatical prose style '' . Ursula K. Le Guin said , `` I have no great opinion of it . When so many adult critics were carrying on about the ' incredible originality ' of the first Harry Potter book , I read it to find out what the fuss was about , and remained somewhat puzzled ; it seemed a lively kid 's fantasy crossed with a `` school novel '' , good fare for its age group , but stylistically ordinary , imaginatively derivative , and ethically rather mean - spirited . '' </P> <P> By contrast , author Fay Weldon , while admitting that the series is `` not what the poets hoped for '' , nevertheless goes on to say , `` but this is not poetry , it is readable , saleable , everyday , useful prose '' . The literary critic A.N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in The Times , stating : `` There are not many writers who have JK 's Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages , to weep -- openly , with tears splashing -- and a few pages later to laugh , at invariably good jokes ... We have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest , funniest , scariest and most moving children 's stories ever written '' . Charles Taylor of Salon.com , who is primarily a movie critic , took issue with Byatt 's criticisms in particular . While he conceded that she may have `` a valid cultural point -- a teeny one -- about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art '' , he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers . Taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books , shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and social isolation each causes . Taylor also argued that Philosopher 's Stone , said to be the most light - hearted of the seven published books , disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims spur the series ' success : the book opens with news of a double murder , for example . </P> <P> Stephen King called the series `` a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable '' , and declared `` Rowling 's punning , one - eyebrow - cocked sense of humor '' to be `` remarkable '' . However , he wrote that despite the story being `` a good one '' , he is `` a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle '' , the formulaic beginning of all seven books . King has also joked that `` Rowling 's never met an adverb she did not like ! '' He does however predict that Harry Potter `` will indeed stand time 's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept ; I think Harry will take his place with Alice , Huck , Frodo , and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade , but for the ages '' . Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed , saying `` It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year - olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas . What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I 'm not sure -- but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump , comfortable , infantilising society and the popularity of Potter . '' </P> <P> There is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which the series was inspired by Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings books . </P> <H3> Social impact </H3> <P> Although Time magazine named Rowling as a runner - up for its 2007 Person of the Year award , noting the social , moral , and political inspiration she has given her fandom , cultural comments on the series have been mixed . Washington Post book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that the large numbers of adults reading the Potter series but few other books may represent a `` bad case of cultural infantilism '' , and that the straightforward `` good vs. evil '' theme of the series is `` childish '' . He also argued `` through no fault of Rowling 's '' , the cultural and marketing `` hysteria '' marked by the publication of the later books `` trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum , a mass - media experience that no other novel can possibly provide '' . </P> <P> Librarian Nancy Knapp pointed out the books ' potential to improve literacy by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would . The seven - book series has a word count of 1,083,594 ( US edition ) . Agreeing about the motivating effects , Diane Penrod also praised the books ' blending of simple entertainment with `` the qualities of highbrow literary fiction '' , but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific merchandising that accompanies the book launches . However , the assumption that Harry Potter books have increased literacy among young people is `` largely a folk legend . '' Research by the National Endowment for the Arts ( NEA ) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the Harry Potter publishing phenomenon , nor has the broader downward trend in reading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the Harry Potter books . The research also found that children who read Harry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres . NEA chairman Dana Gioia said the series , `` got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books . The trouble is that one Harry Potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading . '' </P> <P> Jennifer Conn used Snape 's and Quidditch coach Madam Hooch 's teaching methods as examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching , and Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first - year sociology class : `` sociological concepts including culture , society , and socialisation ; stratification and social inequality ; social institutions ; and social theory '' . </P> <P> From the early 2000s onwards several news reports appeared in the UK of the Harry Potter book and movie series driving demand for pet owls and even reports that after the end of the movie series these same pet owls were now being abandoned by their owners . This led J.K. Rowling to issue several statements urging Harry Potter fans to refrain from purchasing pet owls . Despite the media flurry , research into the popularity of Harry Potter and sales of owls in the UK failed to find any evidence that the Harry Potter franchise had influenced the buying of owls in the country or the number of owls reaching animal shelters and sanctuaries . </P> <P> Jenny Sawyer wrote in Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a `` disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society '' in that stories `` moral center ( sic ) have all but vanished from much of today 's pop culture ... after 10 years , 4,195 pages , and over 375 million copies , J.K. Rowling 's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children 's literature : the hero 's moral journey '' . Harry Potter , Sawyer argues , neither faces a `` moral struggle '' nor undergoes any ethical growth , and is thus `` no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white '' . In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry 's first passage through to Platform 93\u20444 as an application of faith and hope , and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes . She also noted the `` deeper magic '' by which the self - sacrifice of Harry 's mother protects the boy throughout the series , and which the power - hungry Voldemort fails to understand . </P> <P> In an 8 November 2002 Slate article , Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a `` trust - fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him '' . Noting that in Rowling 's fiction , magical ability potential is `` something you are born to , not something you can achieve '' , Suellentrop wrote that Dumbledore 's maxim that `` It is our choices that show what we truly are , far more than our abilities '' is hypocritical , as `` the school that Dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else '' . In a 12 August 2007 , review of Deathly Hallows in The New York Times , however , Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for `` unmooring '' her `` English school story '' from literary precedents `` bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery '' , arguing that she had instead created `` a world of youthful democracy and diversity '' . </P> <P> In 2010 , coinciding with the release of the film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 , a series of articles were written about Private Harry Potter of the British army . This real - life Harry Potter was killed in the Arab Revolt near Hebron in 1939 . His grave , located in the British cemetery in Ramla , Israel , began to receive curious visitors leading the Ramla Municipality to list it on their website . </P> <P> In 2016 , an article written by Diana C. Mutz compares the politics of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign . She states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant ' 1 ) the value of tolerance and respect for difference ; 2 ) opposition to violence and punitiveness ; and 3 ) the dangers of authoritarianism . ' She suggests that these themes are also present in the presidential election and it may play a significant role in how Americans have responded to the campaign . </P> <H3> Controversies </H3> Main articles : Legal disputes over the Harry Potter series , Religious debates over the Harry Potter series , Politics of Harry Potter , and Tanya Grotter <P> The books have been the subject of a number of legal proceedings , stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements . The popularity and high market value of the series has led Rowling , her publishers , and film distributor Warner Bros. to take legal measures to protect their copyright , which have included banning the sale of Harry Potter imitations , targeting the owners of websites over the `` Harry Potter '' domain name , and suing author Nancy Stouffer to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work . Various religious conservatives have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as Wicca and are therefore unsuitable for children , while a number of critics have criticised the books for promoting various political agendas . </P> <P> The books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds . From 1997 to 1998 , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone won almost all the UK awards judged by children , but none of the children 's book awards judged by adults , and Sandra Beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children . In 1999 , the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award children 's division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award , and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner ; it finished second , very close behind the winner of the poetry prize , Seamus Heaney 's translation of the Anglo - Saxon epic Beowulf . </P> <P> In 2000 , shortly before the publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , the previous three Harry Potter books topped The New York Times fiction best - seller list and a third of the entries were children 's books . The newspaper created a new children 's section covering children 's books , including both fiction and non-fiction , and initially counting only hardback sales . The move was supported by publishers and booksellers . In 2004 , The New York Times further split the children 's list , which was still dominated by Harry Potter books into sections for series and individual books , and removed the Harry Potter books from the section for individual books . The split in 2000 attracted condemnation , praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move . Time suggested that , on the same principle , Billboard should have created a separate `` mop - tops '' list in 1964 when the Beatles held the top five places in its list , and Nielsen should have created a separate game - show list when Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? dominated the ratings . </P> <H2> Adaptations </H2> <H3> Films </H3> Main article : Harry Potter ( film series ) The locomotive that features as the `` Hogwarts Express '' in the film series . <P> In 1998 , Rowling sold the film rights of the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported \u00a3 1 million ( $1,982,900 ) . Rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly British , nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of Irish actors such as the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore , and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such . After many directors including Steven Spielberg , Terry Gilliam , Jonathan Demme , and Alan Parker were considered , Chris Columbus was appointed on 28 March 2000 as the director for Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone ( titled `` Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone '' in the United States ) , with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire and proven experience with directing children as influences for their decision . </P> <P> After extensive casting , filming began in October 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios and in London itself , with production ending in July 2001 . Philosopher 's Stone was released on 14 November 2001 . Just three days after the film 's release , production for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , also directed by Columbus , began . Filming was completed in summer 2002 , with the film being released on 15 November 2002 . Daniel Radcliffe portrayed Harry Potter , doing so for all succeeding films in the franchise . </P> <P> Columbus declined to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , only acting as producer . Mexican director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n took over the job , and after shooting in 2003 , the film was released on 4 June 2004 . Due to the fourth film beginning its production before the third 's release , Mike Newell was chosen as the director for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , released on 18 November 2005 . Newell became the first British director of the series , with television director David Yates following suit after he was chosen to helm Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix . Production began in January 2006 and the film was released the following year in July 2007 . After executives were `` really delighted '' with his work on the film , Yates was selected to direct Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , which was released on 15 July 2009 . </P> A studio model of Hogwarts Castle as it appears in the films . <P> In March 2008 , Warner Bros.

Philosopher 's Stone was the highest - grossing Harry Potter film up until the release of the final instalment of the series , Deathly Hallows , while Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least . As well as being a financial success , the film series has also been a success among film critics . </P> <P> Opinions of the films are generally divided among fans , with one group preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films , and another group preferring the more stylised character - driven approach of the later films . Rowling has been constantly supportive of all the films and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her `` favourite one '' in the series . She wrote on her website of the changes in the book - to - film transition , `` It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long . Obviously films have restrictions novels do not have , constraints of time and budget ; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers ' imaginations '' . </P> <P> At the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011 , Rowling was joined by producers David Heyman and David Barron along with directors David Yates , Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and Mike Newell in collecting the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema on behalf of all the films in the series . Actors Rupert Grint and Emma Watson , who play main characters Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger , were also in attendance . </P> Spin - off prequels <P> A new series consisting of five films , beginning with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , will take place before the main series .
