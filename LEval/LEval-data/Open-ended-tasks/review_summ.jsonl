Every room (lobby included) was very clean. They are spacious, very quiet, and come with a coffee maker. Though, the rooms are outdated in decor. The hotel itself is conveniently close to the airport and restaurants. There's a chocolate-chip cookie at arrival, and for the prices, the experience is a good value. Service was exceptional and the quality was great! The rooms are always clean, quiet and spacious with nicely appointed bathrooms. The location is across the street from the airport, was within walking distance to a Denny's and other restaurants. The hotel interior itself is a bit outdated, but the room we stayed was modern. All the staff was exceptionally helpful, courteous, and friendly, keeping the rooms clean and well-prepared. The interior of the hotel needs updating, but the rooms themselves were very spacious, modern, and comfortable to stay in. The hotel itself is conveniently located near the airport, a steak restaurant, fast food, and has a free shuttle service for broader access to Seattle.", "The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful both at the front desk and the restaurant. Expect sweet welcoming gifts at your check-in. Helpful, courteous, warm staff helps with a wind down after traveling. There is also a chocolate chip cookie at check-in. Mostly the staff is extremely helpful and friendly, helping to take the stress out of traveling. The cookies given at check in were greatly appreciated.", "The rooms are large and quite, you can't hear the planes taking off at the airport next door. The beds are comfortable and large. The bathrooms are mixed, some need cleaner doors and to be renovated, others seem clean and well appointed. The ice and vending machines are close. The coffee machine in the room is appreciated. The lighting was insufficient, and an old basement smell was present sometimes. While close to the airport, it was quiet because of thick windows. The beds were large and comfortable with lots of extra pillows. The bathrooms could use some refurbishment. Furnishings were complete with an ottoman, an easy chair, and a coffee maker. A balcony gives a great view of the surrounding city. This hotel features very comfortable and spacious rooms, with balcony, coffeemaker, comfortable beds and were well furnished. Some things that need work is the bad lighting, unkempt bathrooms and smell of mildew. All that being said, the rooms are very quiet even though the hotel is close to the airport.", "It's a convenient location close to the airport, with shuttle service to and from the airport that runs every 15 minutes for 24 hours a day. The shuttle service is very good. It's so close you could even walk to the airport if you wanted. It's also in convenient walking distance of many restaurants. The airport was convenient to reach with the help of a speedy, twenty-four hour shuttle bus. Also located nearby, within walking distance, was a Denny's, a fast food joint, and a steak house. Within walking distance from the airport, this hotel's location is great. There is even a 24 hour shuttle that runs every 15 min that will take you to the airport or some near by places to eat like Denny's Jack in the Box and a steak place.", "The spacious hotel lobby and rooms are very clean, comfortable, and well-appointed. Although the hotel's architecture feels dated, the rooms and bathrooms are clean. Even thought there was a minor issue with gaining access to the room because of a faulty magnetic door, the room and bedding were clean and comfortable.", "The hotel restaurant's food was nicely presented, and sometimes good. However, sometimes it was bland and tasteless, and a bit pricey. The restaurant's clam chowder was good. The breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get. The fresh cookies given at check in were delicious. Food was well presented and some of it was tasty, if a little pricey, but the clam chowder at the restaurant and the breakfast buffet made the trip all the more worth it. Dave's Diner next door was also enjoyable. Although some of the food was bland and a little overpriced, the clam chowder was good. The staff even gave out these delicious freshly baked cookies int he reception area and the breakfast buffet is also a great value for what is offered."], "input": "Review #0:We stayed here on a lay over home from Cancun. It was great to have a comfortable bed and room on our final night of holidays. The kids loved the pool which was warmer than the ones at the resort in Cancun which we could not believe as we were in Seattle! The staff was friendly and we appreciated the cookies after a long flight when we were waiting to check inn. Just a nice touch! Shuttle was convenient and would definitely stay here again. Review #1:I reserved this room through an affiliate travel booking platform and got a great room rate. Aprox. 75.00 (not including taxes) for a full day stay. Late check in was effortless and was greeted with a warmed cookie. I think it is fair to mention it costs to use internet in your room but for business travlers I suppose that is an expected cost. Great friendly staff took the edge off our long day of intercontinental travel. I would choose this hotel again as our stop over. Review #2:We flew into SEA TAC for a few days before our cruise and our travel agent recommended this hotel. The hotel was clean, beds were fine, hotel is located across the street from the air port, was within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place. Room was ready very early in the morning for us. The kids liked the pool and I was able to do laundry before the cruise. It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over), and was next to an Enterprise car rental. Lots of conveniences close by. Downtown Seattle was about a 30 minute ride by light rail service (cost of $16 for the 4 of us) or $40 cab ride to the pier. Hope this helps. Review #3:This is a large hotel and I expected it to be large and impersonal. On the contrary. It has \"small hotel\" service, meaning that you don't feel lost and they treat you well. Several fireplaces and seating areas in the lobby make it comfortable. I had a reservation for a \"mountain view\" room. Initially, I had a view of the airport. I asked for a different room and was given a much better view on the other side of the main section of the hotel. Very nice pool area although in cool, rainy Seattle I didn't get a chance to swim. The food was good although a bit pricey. The service in both the casual restaurant at breakfast and the dining room in the evening was efficient. Spacious room and very comfortable bedding. The room to which I was initially assigned had a broken lamp and a rip in the carpet. The second room was nicer. Looks like they are trying to keep up with on-going updating and maintenance. I stayed here four nights for a conference and was actually pleasantly surprised by the overall hotel experience. Lots of airline personnel stay here as well. And yes, we like the chocolate chip cookies at check-in. Review #4:I stayed here on November 7-8, 2004. When I read the previous reviews, I asked if my reservation was for a wing or a tower room. It was for a wing room but the reservation staff courteously changed it to a tower room. Access to the tower is by external glass elevators. My room was large, quiet and had a small balcony. There was a stain on the carpet but otherwise it was clean and well maintained. The room was equipped with a coffee maker, iron & ironing board and blow dryer and there were 2 sinks - one inside the bathroom and one outside. The room did not have a refrigerator or microwave; the high speed internet connection in the room cost about $10. There is no complimentary breakfast; there is a coffee shop and an espresso bar that also sells yogurt, bagels and pastries. The hotel has a complimentary airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. I was attending a large conference held at the hotel. My co-workers with wing rooms said they were 'okay' and they heard some noise from neighboring rooms. The wing hallways had a damp smell. One wing building was closed for renovation. All staff were very courteous and helpful. For me the location worked well since I was attending events at the hotel and didn't have to rent a car to get there. If I had transportation and didn't have events at the hotel, I would look a few miles away for a better buy for the money. Review #5:We stayed at the Double Tree for two nights in July. The suite was spacious, clean, and quiet. Our room had two sinks,a flat screen TV, and two comfortable beds. Very conveinient for early morning flights. The hotel shuttle will drop you off at your destination as long as it's enroute to the airport. Overall,it was a very pleasant stay at a very nice property. I am very delighted that we stayed there!!!!!!!! ! Review #6:This is the best airport hotel we have stayed in, and we have stayed there twice. It has a convenient location and a shuttle service that runs every 15 minutes for 24 hours. We had a large room with a balcony, comfortable beds, an easy chair and ottoman, and a coffee maker - all things we don't always find. We ate supper in their restaurant and I had an excellent salad (large enough to divide) and an exceptionally good Reuben sandwich. There are also other choices, with several restaurants and fast food places within a very short walk. The staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the warm, chocolate chip cookie we were given at check-in. Review #7:This hotel is the BEST at SeaTac! Valet parking was very quick and hassle free. Check In went very smooth, and we were upgraded to a very large suite at that time! The pool is very relaxing and big. Lounge is great! The rooms are very spacious and very nice. Beds are SO comfortable and the best sleep I have gotten at a hotel. Shuttle service is very quick and so great! They leave every 20 minutes on the hour. I have stayed at many hotels at the airport, and this one beats them all!!! Especially with the shuttle service. You can guarantee that we will be back soon, no doubt about it. Review #8:I had booked this hotel due to my previous terrific experience with a very nice room and bath. Upon arrival, I requested the same room as previously, if available. I was informed that entire floor was currently being re-furbished and there were no rooms of that quality available. He hoped re-furbishing would be complete in January. Interesting, as the beautiful room I stayed in previously was very new-gorgeous bath and soaking tub. I can't imagine those rooms would need refurbishing! I was then given another \"Hilton Honors\" room. I arrived to a room on the very ground floor that had a glass door that opened to the outside parking area. Due to security, I did not think this was a good idea for a single female traveler, however, I did not want to 'make waves' and request another room as I was only there for one night. Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these \"Hilton Honors\" rooms really need refurbishing. I had such a great experience the first time, I am disappointed-and-as a single female traveler, will never stay on the ground floor of any hotel again, if at all possible. Review #9:When you need a hotel near the Sea Tac Airport, stay at the Doubletree and ride their shuttle. The Drivers are very professional, courteous and make you feel like you are their only customer! If something might goes awry, the staff are quick to correct and aim to provide a memorable stay that makes you want to return. The quality of customer service should be an inservice for a number of their competitors. We have stayed at Hotels that are many times more expensive yet the staff are nowhere near as impressive as the Doubletree. The Wynn in Las Vegas should sign up for tutoring to learn how to treat customers. Perhaps then their vacancy rate would dwindle! Review #10:Stayed at this hotel beause the park n fly. Was an excellent choice, beautiful hotel and great beds made for a perfect start for vacation. Have stayed at cheaper hotels with park n fly and they are always scary! Pay the extra bucks for a top of line hotel with free cookies. Review #11:Despite the enormity of this hotel, it very much feels almost family run. The staff are exceptional and the quality without question. The hotel couldn't be better placed for flying out of Seattle. I won't hesitate to book here should my future travels involve a long leg from Seattle. Review #12:We stayed at this hotel for one night before starting our Princess landtour. The hotel reception had a lovely smell of freshly baked cookies which were given out at check in and were delicious. The room was spacious and had a coffee maker. There were 2 double beds and the mattresses were really comfortable. We had a lovely buffet breakfast in the restaurant and sat by the outdoor pool in the morning while we waited for our transfer to the airport. Review #13:My friend and I are both Hilton Honors members. We are currently staying here and prepaid for the room. What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless. On the incoming leg earlier, we stayed across the street at the Hampton for about the same price, wireless internet, free parking and free breakfast. Just doesn't make sense. Overall, the room is nice, but could have a refrigerator in it for the price. One thing I have learned about traveling is that to bring your own router just in case there isn't wireless. Especially when more than one person in the room has a computer. If I come back to Seattle, I'd go back to Hampton. Review #14:After reading the reviews here, my family was VERY disappointed with the hotel. First, the hotel is going through major renovations in the tower part of the hotel. We stayed in the village part of the hotel, which were found to be old and dark. The room was like staying in a basement, an old and mildew smell. The A/C put out hot air. We put the A/C on 60 and the room immediately heated the room up 89 degrees. I could not recommend this hotel. Review #15:We spent the night in this hotel our last evening in Seattle before an 8 a.m. flight. The area around the airport can be iffy, as in many large metropolitan areas. This hotel is clean, neat and offers good value for the money. We felt safe and secure with our small children. AND they have the famous Doubletree chocolate chip cookies! We were wiped out from a long day and wanted to stay in the room for the night and rest. We ordered clam chowder from the menu - much better than I expected - and finished off fruit from Pike Place Market. The hotel has seen its newer days: the carpets are threadbare in some spots and the cement balconies are noticeably empty of furniture. But the rooms are a great size, and we noticed large groups of flight attendants from various airlines staying there as well. The hotel employees were very polite and most efficient: we were on our way to our room within 30 seconds, warm cookies in hand. I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch. Review #16:We flew into Seattle and arrived after midnight. After driving up and down International Bl. one time we decided on checking in at the Doubletree. All the other lodging options seemed to have dimly lit parking lots next to seedy businesses or something. It's an ok hotel by any other standards but nice compared to what's close by. Review #17:I booked a post-cruise package and the staff did not know how that worked. Hassle to get from ship to hotel, hassle to get correct rate, hassle with hotel safe (should have one in room anyway), and a hassle to get to the airport the next morning. They offer shuttle service (sporadically) and even though I was outside in plenty of time, at least 40 people showed up to try and get into a VAN. I took a taxi as everyone was trying to cram into the shuttle with no respect for first-come-first-served. Room service was good, however. Room was an \"upgrade\" but so far from the elevator. Would avoid this hotel in the future. Review #18:Physically, this is a very tired property. While renovations appear to be underway according to signs, the hotel infrastructure shows its age. Even where renovated, the hotel still needs work. My room, in the renovated tower, had very insufficient lighting and a bathroom that had seen better days. Provided amenities (e.g., soap, shampoo) were low quality. The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold. Staff wise, this hotel also needs renovation. Service in the more upscale of the two restaurants was almost unbearably slow and the food was cold when it finally arrived after over a hour at our table. Review #19:Decided to stay one night by the airport and used priceline to get a room and ended up with the doubletree at a good rate! The hotel is pretty big but the location next to the airport is great. I asked for a room in the tower and the room was spacious with a nice king bed and a balcony that overlooked the airport. The views of the airplanes taking off was great! There are a few restaurants around the hotel area and you can also easily walk to the airport should you want to. Review #20:this hotel was so comfortable. After commuting back and fort from florida if too tired to drive back to my destination i always stay at this dbl tree. I have never once had a bad nights sleep in these beds. I love the big warm cookies in the evening. They never seem to slap my hand if I grab 2 or 3...recommendation goes to this hotel over others! Review #21:We've stayed at the Doubletree Seatac four or five times in the past few years, and we've always enjoyed our visits. The hotel has a convenient airport shuttle that picks up guests on level 3 of the airport parking garage at stops #1 and 3. The shuttle runs 24 hours per day, and it makes about three trips per hour (no phone call or reservation is needed). If you don't want to wait, a good alternative is the nearby taxi stand; fare to the Doubletree should be less than $10 because of the hotel's proximity to the airport. On a recent trip, we landed at Seatac after midnight and were picked up within five minutes. The check-in process was courteous and smooth, and we were given a nice corner room with a balcony on the 9th floor (accompanied by the delicious chocolate chip cookies). Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed watching airplanes takeoff and land, and this hotel provides an eagle's eye view of the airport (unless you're on the east side of the tower, in which case you're stuck looking at the snowcapped Cascades and/or Mt Rainier). Despite its proximity to the airport, the room was surprisingly quiet. At 1am the lobby bar was still very active with a jovial but well-behaved crowd, although the bartenders were understandably ready to head home to their families. I was able to purchase a reasonably priced bottle of Oregon pinot noir for in-room consumption. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed. My wife really liked the Crabtree & Evelyn \"Citron\" toiletries; I liked the very comfortable bed and blackout curtains. Review #22:Spent 3 nights at conference at the hotel. The staff are wonderful! They are dedicated and helpful to your every need. Bed's in the room were the heavenly beds and I slept very well all 3 nights. Room was highly run down. Wall paper peeling off walls in different places, light bulb not replaced in room and carpet stained. Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted. Food was very expensive in restaurant and just okay. Burger, soda and tip $21.00. Save yourslf some money and eat off site. This is a hotel in the Hilton chain and I was disappointed.....:( Review #23:This hotel disappointed. As a Doubletree, I expected a GOOD three star property for my stay on August 27, 2004. What I found was rather run down and shabby. We were told we had a great view of the \"lake\" from our room. There was no lake visible. The bathroom was dirty and stained. Carpet was old as were the other furnishings. Coffee shop service was horrible. Waited forever to be seated and there were only 3 others in the place. Waitress never brought the items we requested and the order was askew. We had to go searching for our check to pay it. This Doubletree is very tired, and more like a 2 star property than a 3 star. It looks nice on the outside,, but inside it is very shabby and used. Review #24:This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great. Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland. The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste. The first night there I did not hear any airport noise, but the second night, I clearly heard the planes. I also used the business center, but the computers were slow and ran an old version of software; one printer worked but the other didn't. To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place. Review #25:We opted for the $5 requested upgrade for hhonours members, and the room was superb when we got it. At $65 plus the upgrade this was outstanding value, so much so we used it on our return journey too. Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it. Choice of food was excelent. Review #26:Stayed here after New Year's day and following day since we had tix to Seahawks game 01/02/11. We LIKED the fact that it was close to new rapid transit terminal which we chose to take to stadium. This plus we luv their complimentary cookies that they offer upon check-in. Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room. I had to trek all the way to the front-desk from out tower location (to have key re-coded) only to f ind it did not resolve issue. Frustrated - we called front desk - who called security - who called maintenance. They discovered faulty battery problem and reset. All of this resulted in out take-out food getting cold plus I lost my scarf somewhere along the way. Also, wished to have their shuttle drop us off @ transit terminal but we were told to wait - we decided to walk and it was rather cold. Saw shuttle pass us along the way ;-( Still, LIKE the location and the cookies ;-) Review #27:Across from Sea Tac Airport. Very big, spread out hotel with very reasonable rates and nice rooms, although some are a bit of a convoluted walk from reception. Lots of air crews use this hotel which has a frequent free shuttle to airport. We stay here and go to Seattle for Mariners games. The shuttle will drop you at the airport train station if you are going to Seattle, but on your way back you must walk from the station to the shuttle bus pick up area at the airport(about a 5 to 10 minute walk). Parking and some extras relatively expensive. We have stayed here a few times and keep coming back because it is good value for money. Review #28:Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in. Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in. We have stayed at this hotel several times, and others in the area. It may cost a little more to stay here, but we feel it is worth it for the quiet rooms and the very comfortable beds. Review #29:OUR overall stay was great, would have been nice to have no feathered pillows , not having a MICROWAVE,REFRIDG not cool, they charge each day for a roll away bed they said they would accomumdate for up to five in one room stayed three days so used blankets on the floor for the two boys I requested four blanket but had to go down to argue after only getting one they charge for wi-fi in room, LOBBY FREE- charge for daily parking no continuial breakfast without charging all these should change I called on phone for the entertainment book checking in nope they dont take it close to many places to eat,bank and even small cascino the airport close yes somewhat noisy but hey what one is not only during day time night time very quiet staff quiet friendly HOUSEKEEPING WONDERFUL yes i would recommend this hotel to others it'sa nice place is great for summer as with pool only on outsde . Review #30:This is a good place to stay for a conference or if you need to stay for a night or two near the airport. The room was large and clean. I heard no noise from the airport, or elsewhere. The bed was VERY comfortable (a Serta mattress). This is a large property with (I believe) five buildings. Out the back of mine (#5) the deck looked out into a forest. The walk from that building to the lobby is about 2-3 minutes. Plenty of eating places nearby, and the bar in the hotel is fine also. You are charged for parking - $8/night for outdoor parking. Review #31:We spent one night here before flying out to Alaska. They have a good stay/fly program that we always use to leave our car there while on vacation. The room was clean and bed comfortable. My only complaint is that they charge for the use of wifi in your room. I can walk down to the lobby and get free wifi or use their computers for no charge. So why would I pay to use it in the room? ? Review #32:Very nice hotel, very close to the airport, walkable in fact to the terminals in less than 10 minutes or one can take a free shuttle bus. Check-in was friendly and quick, and one receives a nice warm chocolate chip cookie along with the room key. Large spacious lobby, clean comfortable rooms. Flat screen TV with many stations available. Internet available in the room for a fee or free wifi in lobby. There are also complimentary computers to use also. There is a stand alone kiosk which one may use to check in for flights. All major airlines are represented. Can not speak to the dining aspect of the hotel as I did not eat there. All in all, a nice place to stay before or after the flight. Review #33:I recently spent 4 nights here. The check-in was wonderful, the staff great, and the hotel itself was nice. The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers). And they add a $3 tip on top of the 18% (and then all the regular taxes are there, too). So a burger and soup were $32, and it was a very. VERY average burger. Total rip-off with the excess charges. I did not use daily housekeeping and was able to get what I needed when I saw them in the halls. And the women I met were very, very friendly and polite. But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected. I did email Rissa, who took a day and a half (and two emails) to respond to me. She said all the blahblahblah and offered to change rooms, but I was halfway through my stay and changing rooms is a pain. This was a business trip so I was not looking for compensation on the room. I thought she may care a bit more with the pics as proof, but I guess they hear complaints all day. I did make sure to include all the positive I had to say as well. The internet fees are a HUGE scam-- $12-$15 for 24 hours. There is no way that they aren't banking money here. Parking is another point of contention but I did not park so not really going worry about this one. Overall, if this were MY money, I would NOT stay here. With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room. They don't even have microwaves or fridges in the rooms. Even most motels give you a microwave. Review #34:The DoubleTree was convenient to the airport, even though we were part of group travel, the DoubleTree had an airport shuttle. This is a multi story well thought out hotel. There were elevators, gift shop, restaurant and lots of other dining choices just across the street. You could safely cross the street at the light and crosswalk and find your self at a diner or several other restaurants. The hotel staff was courteous and very helpful with our questions. Our room was large and very comfortable. Even though we were there for just one night we would recommend this hotel for multiple night say if you are visiting the Seattle, WA area. We cannot comment on the value, as our price was included in our group travel, so Iwe're sure it was a group or discounted rate. Review #35:Stayed at this property for one night with my family ( wife and 4 and 7 yr old) before a morning flight. Used the park and fly package. Valet was quick and received help with bags. Check in was very quick and was assigned a two queen room in the tower. Room was typical for a double tree. Decent size with flat panel TV, and normal size bathroom. Had a room that faced away from the airport so that helped with the noise. Slept ok, but the room was quiet. Service was great and bell person got ice for us and was very helpful. Check out was quick. Shuttle bus goes every 18 minutes and we walked out the front door just as one was leaving. Was hoping it would stop but it kept going (empty at that). At that point we waited the 18 minutes with 10 other people and caught the next bus. Return to the hotel was fine. Bus driver called for our car but it wasn't ready when we arrived. waited a few more minutes for valet to bring car back. Be sure to have your receipt for parking from the front desk (i did thanks to previous posts) or you won't be able to get your car. All in all a good airport property. Just be advised, this is a big conference service type hotel and they have many groups that use it....might not always be a quiet hotel, but for our trip it worked out great. Review #36:We left our car for 5 days and stayed in this Doubletree Hotel on our return,our shuttle arrived promptly and we were given a Tower Room . It was a huge room with great bedding,sheet count & pillows. We were pretty late 9.54pm but managed to get a decent meal in the bar, I will happily come back to this doubletrees. Only one hiccup when we were collecting our car through their valet ,the valet asked pretty abruptly as we $5 tipped him if we had settled our parking fee. Unfortunately I hope front desk could have better communication. Review #37:This is a pretty rundown hotel. We did not choose it. Our travel agent booked the hotel through a cruise company as part of a package deal. It was about fifteen minutes away from town and very close to the airport. We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee. The service at the hotel coffee shop was really slow and the waiter seemed really bothered by having to come to our table to see what we wanted. The soup was brought to us pretty cold, but he seemed to vanish so we couldn't complain. Even Denny's would probably have been better. Review #38:Received a great deal on this hotel by bidding on Priceline. I didn't have a car so Airport, Light Rail and many restaurants are in walking distance. They do have an airport shuttle. The staff were very accomodating and I loved the chocolate chip cookie at check in. My room was clean and nice but seemed motel like away from the tower. Maybe I got the cheap seats being a priceline customer. Anyway, I requested a non-smoking room but the floor smelled like the stench of smoke. At least my room didn't reak otherwise I would of tried to change rooms. I just wish the smokers had their own wing. Other than that issue, the hotel is nice and staff was great. Review #39:We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied. The stay, park & fly packages are *usually* a good deal, and their airport shuttle service is fantastic - I believe it runs every 20 mins around the clock. Great for those early morning flights, and no worries about traffic jams as Seatac Airport is right across the street. Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out. The rooms are relatively spacious, our kids love the pool, and the breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get. Review #40:Very close to Seatac, we were tempted to walk there from the airport. In fact, the free shuttle probably spends more time driving back to the hotel than it would probably take to just walk back across the street. The hotel is clearly old but Hilton has gone to some lengths to make it feel more up-to-date. It's obviously clean, although the further you get into the maze of halls the more the funky smell of \"old\" permeates the air. We utilized the free airport shuttle, which is handy, but did not use any other hotel service. The room was fairly quiet when other guests weren't talking in the hall. The bed was quite comfortable and free of bed bugs. The neighborhood has mostly fast-food or 'greasy-spoon' joints except for a nice looking Thai restaurant across the street. We would certainly use this hotel again as our layover sleeping arrangement on our way to and from vacations. Review #41:We had the penthouse suite, 2 rooms with a kitchenette. The shuttle getting from the airport to the hotel was very croweded and hot (yes hot for Seattle) and smelled. We had planned to eat at the hotel restaurant but it was not open. So we had to order a pizza. Strange for such a large hotel not to have a restaurant or two. They told us to go across the street. They did have warm cookies at check-in. The room was done up in buttery soft yellows. The bathroom was huge. Larger then some hotel rooms I've stayed in. It had a sunken in tub, huge walk-in shower, robes & full line of Neutrogena beauty products. Two flat screen TV's-sitting room w/ leather sofa, tables and chairs. There was a huge wrap around balcony with a view of the glass elavators and a view of the Cascade Mts. The bed was so comfy I slept like a baby. The room was very sound prrof, as I did not hear anyone in the halls or other rooms. No b-fast was offered. The shuttle only runs on the hour, not every half an hour like you would assume from an airport hotel. So we almost missed our flight. By the time the shuttle was prepared to leave on the hour there were to many people to fit in the shuttle(they could have run there & back in that time ). The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad. If you are not using the airport shuttle this hotel is great. Review #42:We ended up at this hotel as our flight home was cancelled. We stayed near the airport at the beginning of our trip and stayed at the Cedarbrook Lodge as it was rated no 1 on Trip Advisor. This hotel is on a par in terms of service and room quality. Considering over a hundred people turned up at the same time due to the cancelled flight the check in was very quick. The staff went around the lines of people handing out the essentials of shaving foam, razors, toothpaste, toothbrushes and home made cookies as we didn't have our luggage which was checked into the cancelled flight. Room was enormous, with balcony and was spotlessly clean. Restaurant food was excellent and reasonably priced and breakfast was good. Shuttle service was very quick with plenty of buses on hand. The only issue we had was the size of the hotel with various wings that were difficult to navigate. A few more signs halfway down corridors would have helped. We got lost as did lots of people we met along the way! Don't let this put you off though. Review #43:This hotel embraces its role as an airport hotel and fufils its purpose very well. Staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are decent, and it's very close to the airport. The airport shuttle runs round the clock (every twenty minutes) and is very efficient. The hotel's extended parking option provides great value. Review #44:This place is huge - felt like I was in Disneyworld!! This is an older hotel that has gone through a recent renovation. Overall I was quite pleased as we paid only $50 through Priceline. Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area. Review #45:We have stayed at this hotel several times in the family suite ( 2 bedrooms/1 king and 2 queen beds). Love the warm chocolate chips cookies and the service has always been outstanding. Excellent morning breakfasts and the airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes but we have made the 10 minute walk numerous times to the airport terminal. Review #46:We live about two hours and a ferry ride from the airport and always stay here when we have an early morning flight. We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00. It is somewhat dated but comfortable enough and the shuttle is very reliable. Review #47:We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac. We stayed here the last night of our trip to Seattle (got it on Priceline for $46 - not bad!). The bed was very nice, room was clean, we even had a balcony. It wasn't loud at all from the airport but was loud from the hallway (which didn't bother us since we left by 5 am). They were extremely convenient to the airport. The staff people were really helpful and nice. Plus you get a free cookie at check-in! :) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!! I can see paying parking for a downtown hotel - but for a hotel at Sea-Tac it seemed absurd to have to pay parking. Overall it was still a reasonable deal though. I would stay again. Review #48:Overall this is a good property. Parts of the hotel are laid-out such that it can be difficult to find your room. My co-workers and I joke about the Doubletree Maze at SEATAC. It takes a few trips to figure it out. The hotel is very close to the airport and sometimes we walk. The van in the morning can be very crowded so get in line early. The coffee bar in the lobby is great and opens at 5. The rooms are comfortable and the cookies are great but getting smaller. Review #49:We decided to stay here for three nights during our trip to Seattle. The checkin clerk was very friendly and said she would ensure we had a good view. We ended up on the 11th floor overlooking the airport and the Cascades. We had a balcony, the beds were super comfortable, room was a good size and clean. There are restaurants all around, plus two in the hotel. Shuttle to airport runs every 20 minutes. Great place and would definately stay again. Review #50:I've stayed at the Doubletree several times when I need to fly in and out of Seattle. It's a solid 3* hotel and good value. Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night. If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate. The cons for me aren't a huge issue since I'm just overnighting it, but would be more significant for a prolonged stay. Review #51:We found the Doubletree to be good for what we needed- a place to stay when our plane arrived late and we didn't want to start driving anywhere until the next day. The airport shuttle was very good- better than other hotels I have stayed in. It seemed to ALWAYS be running, and was very convenient. We took the shuttle from the airport, and then back again to pick up our rental car (save the parking fee). The hotel was fine- a big hotel by the airport. I didn't expect much, but some things were better than average. The view we had was of some large trees and some people's backyards- better than the parking lot for us (but I wouldn't want to live there!). The cookies are, of course, one of our favorite things about the Doubletree chain. If I had been wanting to stay for more than one night, be close to anything interesting (other than the artificially created world of SEATAC), or wanted to get some business done, this would not have been the best hotel. But it is fine for what it is- a quick, convenient, comfortable stay by the airport. One thing to think about- this hotel is used by a lot of conventions. When we were there, there were a bunch of real estate agents who were getting a bit rowdy. We couldn't hear them in our room (thankfully), but they were pretty loud throughout the hotel. The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas. We did book directly on the Hilton chain website and got a rate of about $89. It looks from other reviews here like you may be able to do better on Priceline if you don't want your Hilton points. Review #52:I was put into this property by an airline due to a maintenance issue, although I checked in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, I saw enough that I want to return! The pool area, lobby and view from the balcony were very nice, not what I normally find when traveling and especially not this close to the airport! From reading others reviews I was not in the main towers, and only complaint was only being on the second floor someone was above me and from the sound they made walking must have weighed 400 pounds as it was very loud. Other than that, I was greeted very nicely and professionally at the desk by a staff member that had a very irate customer on the phone, in spite of him trying his best from the portion of the conversation I heard, he continued to handle himself in a professional manner, then when he place the caller on hold to assist me, was very courteous and professional. As others have mentioned as well, who's night is not made better when checking in and receiving a warm cookie? The room was nice, comfortable beds, good selection of pillows, nice TV channel selections (was no guide so I had to search for channels). The two sinks were nice (one in the bath portion and one by the closet) that would be a nice feature if traveling with your spouse or children. Also nice view of some trees out the balcony. While the wing I was in appeared to be older, you could tell they try to take care of it and it was very clean. Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor. I have also found that requesting rooms at the end of the hall are quieter. I look forward to returning to this property with my wife and being able to spend more time in the city as well as what the doubletree has to offer! Review #53:Arrived late, they had given our room away. Diamond members get a small gift...it was three pieces of fruit on a stick and two pieces of cheese...can you say cheesy!! Cookies were good, as always. Went to breakfast and got some french toast. Then there was this set-up for the syrup which was under a sterno can and full flame, the syrup was boiling. It was so liquified that it spilled all over my hand and burned me terribly. If it wasn't for Pam the waitress quick actions and bringing me ice, I am sure it would have blistered terribly. I am grateful she was quick. Keep your children away from these set ups, they are going to injure someone terribly! Review #54:We arrived to the hotel July 23rd. late at night. I had called earlier in the day and was assured a roll-a-way was available for us. When we arrived we were told by the front desk the roll-a-way would be sent up immediately and would probably be there before we got up to the room. 90 minutes later we still did not have the bed. We had been told the bed would be sent at 12:00 midnight. At 1:00AM we were again told the bed would be sent right up. At 1:30 the manager on duty (Named Robert) introduced himself to my husband at the front desk. Robert immediately stepped in front of my husband and folded his arms and gave my husband many excuses why it was our fault we didn't have the bed yet. One excuse was that the hotel was full and they didn't have time to serve us as customers. I talked to the manager on the phone at 1:30AM and he was still full of excuses why we didn't have the bed. We were tired and against Trip Advisor's advice we went to the restaurant at the hotel for a late night snack. We ordered food and received ice cold food one hour later. The final straw was the morning we left. I noticed the statement was not under the door on the day we were leaving. When we did leave, there on the floor OUTSIDE our door was our statement with our name on it. Thank God our credit card number wasn't there. Review #55:Great location within view or shuttle ride from the airport. Princess has the contract for cruise passengers so you'll meet a lot of people coming and going on trips in the lobby or restaurant. Breakfast was delicious in the coffee shop, hot scones with jam and coffee. Other restaurants were withing walking distance of the hotel. There's a concierge desk which I found to be very helpful with questions. Free internet usage in the lobby too! I reserved off Priceline and got a great rate. Review #56:Bought our stay here on Priceline. Got a good deal $45 for the night. It is hard to find fault at that price, and I won't. But although the room was huge and lavish with two large queens, it was not a place I enjoyed. Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat. No frig or microwaves in Doubletree hotels, too many pillows on the bed. The room had a large balcony overlooking a lake and on the 4th floor we were up in the trees. Despite the low rate, the receptionist tried to give us the type of room I wanted (high floor, one bed) and was very pleasant to me. A beautiful hotel for other types of travelers - groups, business people, etc. For those using the hotel to fly there are shuttles, flight info, and a kiosk to print out boarding passes (although it did not work for me). Just too too big for a one night stay, but a lovely hotel after all. Review #57:This hotel is a nice size and is convenient to the airport and restaurants. The fitness room is small but the bedrooms are standard. The staff was very helpful with all my business and pesonal needs. The hotel gave me 3 vouchers for $10 of any meal since I am a Hilton honors platinum members. That worked well for me since the food at the hotel is fairly pricey. Review #58:Don't expect a whole lot here. It is an average airport hotel. Confusing layout. Larger than normal rooms do make things more comfortable. The bathrooms are worn and need updating. The workout rooms are decent - especially the larger one in Building Five. Review #59:I sateyed here with husband and 1 year old son. One night we arrieved to find out patio door left wide open. We were on the first floor. There were also 2 cigarette butts on the small patio. Nothing was missing from our room but we were gone for over 10 hours that day and I do not know how long the door was open. The manager comped our parking ($17/day) but he was supposed to let us know who the last person to open our room door was and they never told us. This hotel is by a small lake and at dusk there are misquitos and misc. other bugs every where. I would not recommend this hotel. The only good thing about it was that i booked it on Priceline and got a really good price. Review #60:We stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport for our early morning flight. Although there was a queue at check in the staff offered us warm cookies and appologised for the delay. We were given a free room upgrade (we are Hilton Honors members). The room was a bit basic and dated but it was inexpensive and we could leave our car in their car park while we were on holiday. Shuttle to the airport every 20 mins 24 hours. The restaurant also had good food (we were given a $10 per person coupon to use in the restaurant from the hotel). Friendy waiter/waitress staff. Review #61:If you are staying near the airport, it is a great hotel. Easy to reach, very clean and well-appointed rooms. I was surprised at how nice the rooms were! The bed was amazingly comfortable. It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning. The coffee bar in the lobby was handy, too! Review #62:The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc. No wireless in the rooms. Cheap toiletries, few towels. Review #63:We really won the gamble with this hotel. We booked through a discount website and were completely satisfied with our stay. (For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet. It even had a balcony! The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. On check in, the warm chocolate chip cookies were a lovely touch. All the staff we interacted with were great. I noticed many airline crews stayed at this hotel also. Our room was in the main tower, and was reached by an external elevator with glass walls. Getting to the room was a fun adventure in itself. We explored the other areas of this large hotel complex and noticed some rooms were actually are on a small lake, and others overlook the attractive outdoor pool. There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended. I can not say I slept well, but I think that was due to nerves and excitement about our pending vacation. I did find the beds comfortable, but very jiggly. Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water. I was also woken by the cries of a baby in a nearby room. The most disturbing noises came not from the jet planes across the street, but from the hallway. They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin. There is a Jack in the Box and Denny's across the street as well as a Subway, Thai restaurant and a BBQ restaurant nearby. The shuttle service to the airport ran frequently and was very convenient. If traveling with children, there is oodles of space to set up a portable crib. The hotel felt nice enough for a romantic getaway and was a nice treat as a stop-over. The room also had Wi-Fi access - we even had Wi-Fi on the pool deck! Overall, a great stay. Review #64:We have stayed at the DoubleTree Seatac more than 15 times, love it. I suggest getting a room in the tower. Upgrade to King Corner Room or Penthouse to really treat yourself, balcony are amazing in these rooms. Service is outstanding, there nightclub is always fun and classy. Don't have to worry about drinking and driving, just a elevator ride to your room! Review #65:I arrived late at night and was flustered by the confusing and poorly lit parking options. I was staying at the hotel for under 8 hours and yet the clerk who checked me in was still encouraging me to pay for the valet parking. At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet! The hotel room was fine, but I am not sure that this was worth it. I am a loyal Hilton customer and am glad to get the points but this hotel seems better-suited to guests staying for several days, not for someone who just wants a place to crash before an early flight. Review #66:I had a quick stay here last week for one night. The good news - the hotel is very close to the airport with a 24hr shuttle to the airport. My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting. The not so good news - food at the hotel was OK. I believe there are better options in walking distance from the hotel. Review #67:Our family stayed at the Doubletree for one night before flying out to Miami for a Caribbean cruise. We parked our car there for a week, and were impressed with the service and rates compared with the airport. The rooms are a good size, which is a bonus for me as I was traveling with my husband and two large teenaged sons in one room. We spent a good portion of our early evening at the pool, which has an awesome setting. We had dinner in the attached restaurant, and the food was absolutely delicious. After a good nights sleep, the free shuttle to the airport saved us a lot of stress! We would definitely stay here again when flying out of Seattle! Review #68:I stayed here for a week in June, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous. The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat. A great hotel that I would happily stay again in. Review #69:I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience. Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code. I always ask for a room near the lobby and am always accomodated. The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle. The rooms are always clean, the beds great, bedding and bath linens top notch. They recently have gone to flat sceen televisions throughout the place which was overdue but is greatly appreciated. I've always found staff friendly and every request granted. Airport pickup runs every 15 minutes. The cookies are a nice touch too. I'm always pleased when my Priceline bid results in the Doubletree Review #70:This room was one of the most comfortable rooms I've stayed at in a long time. Cushy bed, flat screen tv, great water pressure. Room was quiet and the shuttle to the airport runs 24 hours. I was there by myself and felt very safe. On the downside, I just recently tried to make a reservation for another night with my husband, and they want to charge $10 for the second person. (Yet they gave me two queens) Review #71:We stayed here for 1 night in August since we had an early flight the next morning. Check in was easy and the cookies were nice. Having the printer in the lobby to print your boarding pass was really convenient. The elevators for the tower are not close. We wanted to carry our own luggage and got tired of the bell hops asking if they could take it for us. They were not too thrilled when we wanted to borrow their cart. t was a very long walk to get to the room. The room itself was nice but not for $200.00 per night. The inner hall was quiet but there was a lot of traffic noise from the outside. The bed was comfortable but between the noise of the traffic ( not the jets) and the room fan, we did not sleep well. There was mildew in the bathroom-cleanliness was fair. The shuttle to the airport was very nice and had bottled water. We would not stay here again because of the noise and mildew. Review #72:We took a Park'n'Fly package which allows us to stay 1 night and park our vehicle for up to 7 days. This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling. The Front staff were friendly and efficient in getting us checked in and taken care of. Even got free cookies - wasn't expecting that. The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms. Use the map the front desk provide and you will have no issues. Our room was nice and clean and on the back side (away from street traffic), plus only heard planes when we has the sliding door opened. We didn't have a chance to use the pool, although enticing. We were able to grab a quick bite and coffee at the convenience Starbucks in the lobby on our way out to our flight. We would gladly stay here again! Review #73:Before departing to New York, we stopped overnight in Seattle and stayed at this hotel after scoring a great deal from Priceline. The hotel is huge and they give you warm cookies once you check-in. The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport. Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!). The only downside is that the lady at the front desk gave us the weirdest directions to get to our hotel room. We ended up going outside, and around and got lost when we found out later that we could have just gone around the corner from the check-in desk. We loved that they were playing the Canucks game in the restaurant/bar, too! The airport shuttle service was great, friendly and on-time. Staff is very courteous and friendly. Review #74:I've stayed here a couple of times. The chocolate chip cookies are always a treat. The rooms are clean and nicely appointed. I used the computer in the lobby to print my boarding pass. The shuttle is convenient and reliable. It is on a busy street and I didn't see a restaurant within walking distance so I ate in the lobby. It was fine. Review #75:Hotel is very close the the airport and room was comfortable. Had a huge mirror in the bathroom that was well light around the edges. Wolfgang Puck coffee was available for the in room coffee maker, My room was in the tower on the 8th floor and had a balcony. Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax. If you have a AAA membership they will give you 25% off. That's where I parked. Review #76:As prior reviewers state, great place to stay the night before a flight. Stayed with my teenage son. Wonderfully quiet, considering the airport is literally across the street. Rooms large and comfortable. But still charging for the internet!! (and no in room wireless). It may be a profit center, but when Best Western gives free internet, it is time to change the policy. Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste. I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night. Review #77:On a recent US trip we probably stayed in about 10 hotels and this one wouldn't rank in the top 20! This is a very large and confusingly laid out hotel. When we found our room we discovered that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there were dirty towels lying around. We advised reception who promised immediate action. When we returned about 10 hours later nothing had been done. We were offered a change of room and the assistance of a three man team to move. We began loading our luggage ourselves and when no-one arrived I headed to reception to be greeted by one man with our new room key. He made no offer to assist. No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist. We had decided to go with this hotel to save a small amount of money and as a change from the Cedarbrook lodge we had stayed in a couple of weeks before. Big mistake. On the basis of this experience I will never choose a Doubletree hotel again. It is just not worth the money. Review #78:We stayed 3 days at the Doubletree Hotel in July 2006. The front desk staff were grouchy, uninterested and not pleasant to deal with. We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel. We were quite surprised as this was the only hotel during our two week Washington State vacation that did not provide a fantastic experience. Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable and spacious. I would not stay at a Doubletree Hotel again. It must be an unhappy place to work because it sure comes through to the customer. Spend your money at a hotel that does not see guests as interruptions in their day. Review #79:After a miserable day at Sea-Tac, we thought the Doubletree would be heaven. Well, not quite. The hotel is divided into different wings. The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty. The decor and bathroom are straight from the 70's!! ( Liekthe Brady bunch!). Rooms are not particularly posh or large. Ours was kind of dingy, definitely in need of a remodeling. My wife and I stayed only 1 night before flying out of Sea-Tac the next morning. Hotel was fine for our purposes, but I wouldn't have wanted a longer stay there. Beds were very comfortble . Free internet access in the lobby only and open 24 hrs. . Pool and whirlpool were nice, but would prefer 24 hr. access like health club. Room service was typically expensive . We ate at both the lounge and the cafe and food was average at best, but the service VERY GOOD! (Eben the bus boy made sure we were served well) The front desk staff was also very good! The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture. The room room's AC was working fine and it was pretty quite. No airplane or traffic sounds. The free airport shuttle runs every 15 mins or so and really helped us catch our flight the next morning. So overall you get what you pay for. I got a good night sleep. Review #80:We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased. We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels. The rooms were very spacious, modern and clean. The shuttle was an extremely convenient as well. I would highly recommend the Doubletree and plan on staying here again on our next trip. Review #81:Like many before us, we stayed here before heading out to somewhere else the next day. The check-in was a bit slow, but when our turn came, I could understood why because the desk staff was incredibly friendly and determined to answer all of our questions--she was a very nice person. In fact every staff member that we encountered here was friendly. We had a double queen room in the tower, looking out towards the mountains. The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate. The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional. I am told there are good Thai and BBQ restaurants within walking distance across the street. We tried the hotel restaurants and the food was quite good. Hotel pool is outside, heated to a nice temp and there is a hot tub nearby with a nice seating area all around. Self-parking is $19. Internet is free if you have HH Gold and works well. All in all a fine stay. Review #82:I stayed one night at this hotel, as we were flying out early the next morning. The hotel is conveniently located, just across the street from the airport entrance with a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes. I was disappointed to learn there was a fee for parking ($16+tax), a fee for Internet ($5 for one hour), no simple breakfast included. When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that. The hotel was nice; good clean rooms. Our room was connected to the main lobby by a skyway; we were in building 5 -- it wasn't very close. On the plus side, we got warm cookies upon check-in. The diner next door was good -- I think it's 'Dave's Diner'. Overall, it was a nice hotel, if you are prepared to pay for it. Review #83:My husband and I stayed here for one night before a cruise. This is a huge hotel. Clean rooms, comfortable bed. If you use their free airport shuttle service, make sure you get on the right shuttle from the airport because there is another Double Tree with a separate shuttle. Review #84:Stayed for one night before catching a flight out of Sea-tac Airport. Booked thru hotwire and got such a great price ($69) we were worried what we'd be getting.... We were very pleasantly suprised!! We were greeted by very nice front desk staff and were given the Doubletree warm welcome cookies...what a nice touch! The room was very clean, cozy and very quiet even though it was so close to the airport. The hotel it's self was huge, but yet it still felt very comfortable. It has that \"west-coast\" feel to it with lots of wood and glimpses of green forrest outside. The beds were amazing. The restaurant was quite good considering it's not \"downtown\". The food was decent as was the wine selection. We will definately stay here again. Review #85:We needed a hotel near the airport for just one night, and selected the Doubletree. It was a great decision. Our plane landed at noon, and when I called about an early check-in there was no problem. In spite of the fact that a large convention was concluding and check-out time was not until noon, they had our room ready and waiting. The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and a large selection of various pillows. There was a good TV, and nice bathroom with thick towels and plenty of hot water. Every room seemed to have a balcony. Our balcony looked over the pool enhanced with mature Pacific Northwest landscape. We loved the decor of the hotel. It was very suitable to the geography, and we did not have that feeling that we were just in any big hotel in any big city. We were especially impressed with the staff at the hotel. Our check-in and check-out were accomplished efficiently by pleasant and personable people. You absolutely cannot beat a Doubletree chocolate chip cookie as a welcome treat. My only complaint about this hotel was the charge for parking. I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car. Nonetheless, we will certainly stay at this hotel when we return to Seattle again. Review #86:I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The room we stayed in was beautiful! Newer furniture, very comfortable bed with nice linens, two large sink areas and super clean. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the spa/pool area and they have a nice lounge with free internet access terminals. Free shuttle to the airport got us to the terminal in about 3 minutes! If you are looking for a place to stay near the airport - this is a great one! Review #87:Located within a few miles of Sea-Tac this is a very large hotel with a Starbucks, gift shop, meeting rooms, breakfast room, bar and dining room. The food was a little expensive-$13 for a burger and $12 for an omelette alone. However it was good enough. I had a spacious and clean suite with fridge, microwave, nice sized table and a comfortable bed. I loved that the heating system was quiet. I had plently of outlets, but my suite on the 12th floor had recently been remodeled. The walk out balcony was a nice surprise. It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings. From the wings it was a bit of a hike to the restaurants and front desk. Nice pool and fitness areas. Parking is expensive at $25 for valet and $21.50 for self-park per night. Free shuttle to and from airport helps. Verify internet price-not free. Good jumping off spot for wherever you want to go. Review #88:We stayed at this hotel one night before an Alaska cruise. We arrived very late, were greeted at the desk by a friendly employee who handed us a warm chocolate chip cookie to munch on while we were waiting for our room key. The breakfast in the restaurant was amazing, and the staff was very attentive and friendly. The room was very clean and comfortable. The gift shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced. We would highly recommend this hotel for before and after cruising because it is minutes from the airport and is lovely. Review #89:Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot. To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to \"park and fly\", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!! What a rip-off! ! Review #90:Stayed one night here after coming in late, before leaving the next morning. Used points, so I don't know the regular room rate. Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport. but had some issues too. Details... GOOD: --Rooms, in the tower where we stayed, are pretty decent. Plenty big, nicely kept bathrooms, bed was fairly comfy. --Rooms have a small deck, but the view is of the airport - nothing spectacular. --Staff was friendly, both at the desk and in the restaurant. --Location is very convenient to the airport, and pretty quick access to I-5. --Cookies at check in were good. ;) BAD: --YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE. This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking. This place had a gigantic parking lot. I think parking cost $12 or so. Ripoff. --Restaurant staff seemed to be overwhelmed during breakfast, so they fell behind a bit. Food was good, but a bit overpriced. --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property. --Common areas could be kept up better and cleaner. --The doors to the rooms have a huge gap at the bottom - allows a lot of light and sound in from the hallway. If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice. But you may want to consider other places as well, shop around a bit. Review #91:Love that the hotel provided a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, every 15-20mins. The Hotel was clean, great staff, was greeted with hot fresh cookies at the check-in counter. My daughter, 5yrs old, loved it! My husband was hoping there was an indoor pool, but the pool was warm, and the hot tub was awesome. Pool hours was morning until 11pm. If you don't want to eat breakfast at the hotel, there is a Denny's across the street and an IHOP 2mile down the street. Buses are available for $2.00 and the Rail is $5.00 round trip to WestLake, Seattle, and back to the SeaTac. Love riding the Rail from SeaTac to downtown and the Monorial is $2.00 to the Space Needle. ($4.00 roundtrip). I didn't rent a car, so didn't have the worries of paying a parking fee at the hotel. No need for a car, I got around just fine on the busses and the Rail. My room was very easy to find, but I know others had some difficulties finding their rooms. Maxi's, is a club to the top of the hotel. Heard it was great, but didn't check it out, as we had our daughter with us. Enjoyed they had computers available, and a printer so you can print out your boarding pass. Even though the hotel was close to the airport, you couldn't haer the planes taking off, it was quiet and very relaxing. Slept like a baby...very comfortable beds. Will stay there again in the future. Review #92:We have stayed at several Seatac airport hotels, all acceptable. This trip we needed a quick access to the airport with wheelchair accessibility and this was it. After this stay we will only stay here in the future when at Seatac. They not only are wheelchair accessible, but have an ADA van and very courteous staff that doesn't act put-out at having to help disabled guests. The hotel itself is very nice, we were given a very recently updated room in the tower. The restaurant and bar restaurant are better than average and again great staff. My husband was quite happy with the clam chowder he ordered at the bar after a late night arrival, and that's saying something! The beds were very comfortable, room large enough for wheelchair, and bathroom clean. All good! Review #93:This property is a mess. It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again. When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble. I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room. I asked for a room in their Tower, but was told that Priceline customers had to pay a ten dollar a night premium, which I GLADLY paid. But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in. It's NO three star hotel at all. Priceline should be ASHAMED of rating it up with the Hilton SEATAC, where I was placed on the first night. The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare. Review #94:We stayed one night here before our flight home and I wish we had stayed here longer! What a great place. Warm cookies when you arrive. The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice. The rooms were gorgeous and spacious and comfortable. For $5 we got an upgrade to a family suite - which has 2 connecting rooms, 2 sinks AND a full bath. You cannot beat this for families. The pool was huge and gorgeous. This was cheaper than the hotel we stayed at downtown and I think in the future I would look for places like this outside the city and get a rental car to drive into the city. Review #95:This was a great hotel. Close to the airport. They provided a shuttle if you do not have a car. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very nice. The swimming pool looked nice but we didn't get the chance to swim. We had dinner in the bar area. It was good and the staff was attentive. Check in and check out was easy and fast. It was a long ackward walk to our room. You go up stairs, down the elevator and thorugh doors. Odd but we made it. Surprisingly since this was close to the airport, we weren't woken up by any airplanes. Review #96:Expecting the Doubletree name to be better quality. The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect. And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge! Our room was reserved well in advance, with no mention of a parking fee for their guests! Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay. I will not stay in a Doubletree again. Review #97:We stayed here for a couple of nights at the start of our US vacation. We had a large room very clean and well furnished. Breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful. Hotel shuttle picked us up at the airport and took us to the light rail station to go into Seattle the next day. It wasn't noisy at all as you might expect being so close to the runways. Review #98:Stayed in the high-rise portion. Room was spacious and clean. Nice size bath. Ate at on-site bar/restaurant which was good. Staff asked family with small child to move to restaurant portion which was the right thing to do. Lobby has PC with printer to check in to airline and print boarding pass. Printer didn't work but able to check in for flight. Complimentary shuttle nice although couldn't fit everyone on a Sunday mid-AM! Review #99:I stayed in this hotel for 1 day, as a side trip from Vancouver. Yes it is a bit far from downtown, but very close to the airport. The hotel interior itself is a bit outdated, but the room we stayed in (in the tower) was very pleasant, relaxing and modern. I absolutely loved the warm cookies we were given at check in and the beds in our room were so incredibly soft. I actually miss the beds! The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating. I will definitely stay here again when I visit Seattle.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

I read the wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor and was able to get a room in the main house for a very reasonable price. From the moment we stepped inside the heavenly air-conditioning of the lobby, our expectations in all areas were surpassed. Caroline at the front desk was friendly and welcoming, and gave us a free glass of wine after we checked in. Our room on the third floor was sparkling clean, cool, and well-appointed, with window seats under the gables and a view out over Fleming St. The room was kept clean and neat and the turndown service each night was great. Everyone at the front desk was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. One of the best things about the Marquesa is the beautiful hidden courtyard with two pools. The garden is beautifully landscaped and there are towels, lounge chairs, and free water and iced tea (and, in the morning, coffee) for guests. We spent one long afternoon lounging there and it was wonderfully relaxing! Overall, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of a single thing I would change about our stay. The Marquesa was a lucky find for us, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll absolutely recommend it to everyone! Review #1:We visit Key West often but have been staying at different places. We have now settled in to our favorite! Close to Duval but peaceful and secluded when you want it. The service was great, clean rooms,beautiful gardens and pool, helpful staff, and great bed. Walk every place in old town made easy. Take my word and enjoy the Conch Republic in style. Review #2:Management is very helpful with suggestions of things to do, where to dine, and directing their guests around Key West. The Marquesa Cafe offers great evening diining. Continental breakfast, an additional fee, is served in the guests rooms - or weather permitting - on the guests patios. The central courtyard is very private, sheltered, and quiet. Water, iced tea, and towels are set out daily for guests to enjoy while in the courtyard enjoying sun, shade, or swimming in one of two pools. One pool is heated and one not. The hotel sits back from Duval St by a couple of blocks in a quiet, historic, residential area. A true gem. Review #3:We loved the location of the Marquesa. We did not have to drive our entire stay. Walked everywhere. CLEANIEST hotel I've ever been in. We stayed in a junior suite, which gave us our own porch. We thoroughly enjoyed that. Bathroom was nice big size too. The grounds are beautiful and never seemed crowded. Loved the homemade blueberry banana bread for breakfast. Very happy there was parking onsite. Bed was comfortable. Staff was outstanding. Can't think of anything to complain about....oh just noise a couple of mornings when trash truck made pick up woke us up, but we went back to sleep after. Review #4:We LOVE this place! We found the Marquesa on our fourth trip to Key West and now it's the only place we stay when we go back. We eloped and married on the beach there several years ago, so KW has a very special place in our hearts. To us the Marquesa is quintessential Key West. The location is perfectly situated to all the bars, restaurants and activities you could want or need. Park the car once you arrive (for free) and never move it again until you leave. You're half a block from a great little grocery store and 2 short blocks from Duval. The restaurant on site is fantastic and the bar is very cozy. The service at the hotel is perfect - catering yet unobtrusive. Free wine at check in certainly helps you settle in too. Newspaper of choice is available every morning. The Chinese takeout across the street is among the best I've ever had. The pools at the hotel are incredible - private in a gorgeous setting with all the ice cold tea and water you can hold. The rooms are very finely appointed and the bathrooms fairly spacious with high end touches. Consistently awesome! Review #5:My wife and I just returned from our first trip to Key West. I had no idea where to stay but did know that I wanted to be close to the excitement of Duval Street, but not disturbed by it when I returned to my hotel. The Marquesa was the perfect choice; and aside from a great location, this hotel has character, and a fantastic staff, all for reasonable prices. Sounds too good to be true, but that is exactly what we experienced at this hotel. The pool area is beautiful, the rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. To top it all, every morning there was fresh, good coffee waiting in the pool area. I can't say enough about how impressed we were with this hotel; we highly recommend it, and will stay there again next when we go back. Review #6:Every year we need a break before the New England winter settles in and always decide on Key West, but more specifically, the Marquesa Hotel. This is our seventh year staying at the Marquesa and each time it exceeds our expectations. We are always able to reserve the perfect Junior Suite overlooking the pool area - the reservations staff is so helpful in meeting our requests. The suites are very comfortable and well laid out and the balcony/patio area is the perfect place for breakfast or cocktails in the evening. Housekeeping service is exceptional - they even remember us from year to year! The entire staff is very helpful and welcoming. Special kudos to the \"orchid lady\" who grows such beautiful plants. Great location two blocks off Duval - quiet and peaceful but convenient to everything. The adjoining Cafe Marquesa has to be the best restaurant in Key West - wonderful food, changing menu (try the Small Plates), creative chef and again terrific staff. Review #7:This was my second trip to Marquesa--i gave it good reviews last year. This was my first time visiting during the peak season. The rate was 450 plus tax for a Jr. Suite. It was great room and amenities are good. They now have flat screen TVs. Internet service is free but spotty in rooms, excellent by the pool. There was a wine reception on Sat evening for the guests--a nice touch. Guests are different when its the high season. It's an older crowd and less diverse. It was spring break and quite a few teens were there with parents. I must say I was initially concerned, but they were all excellent guests and well behaved. A number of guests got complimentary upgrades to suites while I was there. While this is usual hotel practice, in a small property, I wish the staff was more discrete about it. I had fronted the money up front and received no special upgrade other than a check in bottle of Fiji water. The only other thing that bothered me was the snootiness of the front office staff. This is key west, land of the casual--attitude belongs on the mainland. When we checked out, we stayed a few hours in the lobby of the hotel until our flight. The owner came out of the office and asked if we needed help. We told hime we just checked out and were waiting to go to the airport. He shrugged his shoulders and left irritated we were sitting there. Now mind you, we spend 6 nights there and 3000 dollars in his hotel. A thank you and \"I hope you enjoyed your stay\" would have been more appropriate, Not all staff slung attitude. Housekeeping and grounds personel were lovely and very helpful. Overall, this is an excellent hotel and i'd stay here again. Most of my concerns were minor--but at 500 a night I left with a slight sour taste in my mouth. Review #8:Perfect location not far from Duval. The grounds are beautiful with most of the rooms enjoying a porch and lovely view of the pools and lush foliage. Our room was elegant, clean and well appointed. The staff was very helpful. Parking is easy as the property has a garage for guest use. Loved it! Review #9:My husband and I just enjoyed a fantastic three-night stay at the Marquesa. When we arrived, we received a warm welcome and an upgrade to a gorgeous third-floor suite. The desk attendant served us complimentary wine to enjoy while he parked our car and booked a dinner reservation for us at 7Fish. The hotel was the perfect home base as we explored Key West on foot, enjoying local restaurants and shops. My husband loved cooling off in the Marquesa's pools after a day of kiteboarding at Smathers Beach. The all-day iced tea and water served poolside was a nice touch. Small details like this really made our stay special. We ate very well in Key West, but our favorite meal was at Cafe Marquesa. Everything we ate, from the homemade bread and hummus to the blackberry ice cream for dessert, was fabulous and fresh. Service was excellent - attentive, but not stifling. Overall, our stay was perfect! Review #10:We picked this hotel based on TA reviews. Upon arrival we were greeted by Richard and made to feel as if we were the only guests. Richard sat down with us to review the both the history of the property as well as the current ammenities. He then reviewed the highlights of Key West. Richard offered that the hotel would make any necessary arrangements for extracurricular activites, including transportation rentals, meals and/or leisure activities. Following our introduction he met us at the garage entry and directed where to park the car. After leading us to our room, he filled the ice bucket and returned with two complimentary glasses of wine. The landscaping is amazing. Everything from the swimming pools, one heated and one not, both by design, to the manicured grounds. The courtyard, onto which the rooms and main entry opens, are truly an oasis. The main house and surrounding buildings were stunning. No detail was overlooked for an immaculate fit and finish. Our first room, a standard room, was charming, intimate and relaxing. We loved Key West so much, that we decided to stay another night. Due to a lack of avilability our standard rooms, we were upgraded to a JUNIOR SUITE for the same price we paid for the standard room. This room was poolside and amazing. Attention to detail and superior customer service made for a memorable trip and we already know where we are staying next time. Review #11:I have stayed at the Marquesa 4 times now for both business and pleasure and enjoyed every visit. The staff are unbelievably helpful and always willing to make the guests feel special. I have been fortunate to have the rooms overlooking the pool three times and only one time did I request it. The grounds are kept up very nicely and the rooms are up to date with high tech amenities and always very clean. The hotel is located right in the middle of downtown and only one block from the main street of shops and bars - Duval Street. Not very many people know about this little diamond in the ruff unless someone has told them about it. I hesitated writing a review because I don't want many people to know about my little find.- Orlando, Florida Review #12:This hotel has been beautifully remodeled and a true oasis in the middle of a busy city. It is close to Duvall Street without being in the traffic and noise. An easy walk to restaurants, shops, and attractions. If you book one of the \"standard rooms\" which we did as it was the only room left, be sure to ask the reservation agent about the views from the windows. We were told our room faced the Gardens but were not told that the view out the window was of the roof of the restaurant next to the gardens and of the exhaust fan serving the restaurant. This was a huge disappointment to us. The room itself was fine but small, which we were expecting. My only suggestion to the hotel would be to have at least one staff member at a location that is accessible to the guests. The computers and business functions are in a room off the parlor with a door and glass window. Employees sit with their backs to the door. Review #13:The Marquesa is a beautiful hotel that is exquisitely decorated. The restaurant is fantastic as was the service. The courtyard and pool area were a total escape from the Duval Street madness. A negative is the lack of an elevator, so if that is a concern keep that in mind when booking rooms. Overall a positive experience. We would go back. Review #14:My husband and I just returned from a 6 day stay, along with friends, at the best hotel we've ever visited. This was our fourth winter getaway to the Marquesa and it is a consistent delight! We were welcomed with an offer of a glass of wine and our room had a beautiful fresh orchid to give us a sense of the tropics after our harsh snowy winter. Our second floor poolside room shared a deck with a similar room which was occupied by our friends. Each morning we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast brought to the deck in minutes from the time it was ordered. The hotel has two pools in a courtyard garden which is serene and quiet. Iced tea and ice water is always available as are plenty of towels and lounges. We always have dinner at the Cafe Marquesa on our final night in Key West, calling it the Grande Finale, and grand it was. The four of us had a fabulous meal from start to finish, and a thoughtful server. The best part of the Marquesa experience is the incredible staff. They make a point of getting to know their guests and their interests. No request is too big. The staff make our dinner reservations in advance every year, then provide us with a summary of our places and dates (and are happy to make last minute changes and provide recommendations). Carol, the managing partner, is always available for a chat, as are Bob, the manager, and staff Mary, Sean, and Dennis. This year it took us over two days of cancelled flights and rental cars to arrive in Key West, yet the moment we disembarked at the Marquesa, all of the stress just vanished. We felt as if we were home, but in a home that pampers its occupants with luxury and the best of the human spirit. We already have our booking made for next year. Review #15:We just returned from an incredible stay at the marquesa. We stayed in room 18, a beautiful suite with a patio overlooking the pool. We just love the feel of this hotel, you really feel like you are staying at a friend's house. The staff was very attentive but inconspicuous. I swear the housekeeping staff watched us leave because if we were gone, we came back to a full ice bucket and a tidy room. Can't wait to return next year! Review #16:My buddies and I went down to Key West for five days of drinking and shenanigans during the powerboat races. At the start of the trip there was like a 90% chance we were going to destroy the hotel room. As soon as we got there the staff was courteous, friendly, and extremely helpful even though most service people would have treated us poorly based on appearances. That changed our whole outlook and we were instead courteous, quiet, and clean. The staff is the best I have ever seen in a hotel. They had iced tea and coffee outside on a table by the beautiful pools. Every time we had a request for daytime activities, like jet skis and fishing, the concierge knew a guy who had a great deal for a good time. Plus, they were like janitorial ninjas, every time we went out we came back to a cleaned room and were never interrupted by housekeeping. How do they do that? It's close to Duval St with all of the associated bars and restaurants, and walking distance to anything of importance. (except the airport, meh) The only thing it could use was a microwave in the room, but the bigger suites probably have that. Review #17:Wanted to get a quiet getaway by myself in Key West for a couple of days. This was the place. Everything is pristine here and this is the best B&B in Key West. The restaurant food is excellent. The rooms are wonderful. I have stayed here before and have had the pleasure of staying in several different rooms throughout the property. All the rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious. The property has two pools of which one is heated. The lush landscaping makes your stay quite enjoyable when you return from walking on Duval street. Sitting by the pool in this little paradise really made all the stresses of life just go away. Review #18:Made a spur of the moment reservation at Marquese by phone and checked in the following day. On arrival we were greeted by Mary, who has a way about her, one of the most gracious people I have ever met. She showed us to our room, and returned a few minutes later with wine for us. Everything about this hotel is perfect. Extremely comfortable, very pretty, very relaxing, amazing staff. After having dinner at Marquesa's restaurant - also very good, the waiter offered to deliver dessert to our room since we were tired and stuffed, and he walked with us, carrying dessert back to our room. Marquesa is heaven. Review #19:We have just returned from 3 nights at the Marquesa. Very impressed with this hotel. The staff could not be any nicer! A nice touch is indoor parking, but it is small and limited to about 9-10 cars. We arrived about 3:30pm and got the last indoor spot. There is additional parking outside. We had a 'Queen Deluxe' room (#2). It had a comfy queen sized bed, and a fold out queen sized sofa bed that I was told was surprisingly comfortable by the folks who used it. I was expecting the room to be a little larger, but the 4 of us weren't too cramped. The bathroom was very large. Nice 26\" (or so) LCD TV. Private deck overlooking one of the 2 pools with 2 chairs, 2 small tables and a lounger. The landscaping is awesome, lots of palms and tropical foilage. Well maintained, and very nice.The location is very nice. One minute, half block walk to a small but nicely equiped grocery, with a deli and beer/wine, liquor store just a minute further (on Fleming towards Duval). Mallory Square is just about a 10 minute walk... if you don't stop for a drink or shopping. The Cafe Marquesa adjacent, look very elegant, but too upscale for us so we did not eat there. I did look at a menu and entrees were in the $30-$40 neighborhood. We were there mid-week and there were always chairs and loungers available poolside, with fresh large towels provided and always available. The staff were very attentive and always available to help us in any way needed. The $50 per person, per night charge for the 3rd and 4th person was a bit excessive I think, but the same was being charged by other hotels I checked before booking. Overall, we really enjoyed the hotel and our stay and would easily recommend it to family and friends. Review #20:I stayed at Marquesa Hotel for five nights in June 2010 based on the recommendation of friends (who were also traveling with us). I can't say enough good things about this boutique hotel. The staff were very attentive - everything is spotless (even the pool-side restroom). I took advantage of the promotion they offered that provided an upgraded room. Therefore, I booked a stanrdard room but received a pool-side deluxe room. The size of the room was adequate. As I mentioned before, everything was spotless. Upon arriving, we were treated to a glass of wine by the pool. Hotel staff was happy to point out great places to dine and sites to see. One afternoon, we were treated to fresh watermellon by the pool in addition to the water and iced tea that was offered daily. The staff was very attentive without being intrusive. There are two pools w/ adequate chairs and umbrellas. The location of the hotel is ideal if you want to be a short walk to Duval Street but far enough away from the noise and crowds. I highly recommend this hotel to those who appreicate boutique hotels and have high expectations. Review #21:Main plus points - beautiful peaceful grounds (there seems to be music playing wherever you go now but none here-relief). Beautifully furnished rooms, great bathroom. Staff very discrete and left us alone. Good location. Free parking out of the sun. Very high level of cleanliness. Minus points - astonished that at this level of hotel there is no complimentary water. It was in the high 80s and 90s but no water to be had (unless you buy it from the mini-bar.) Some staff a bit cold. No room service menu. Some of the sun beds looking a bit shabby. Review #22:Booked three nights stay at the Marquesa based purely on Tripadvisor reviews - Upon arrival we could see that this was the correct decision.This hotel is immaculate in every respect and a little piece of paradise in the middle of Key West. Paid an on-line \"offer \" price of $250 per night for a suite and justified this amount due to it being our last three nights stay of a two week tour of Florida. If you fancy a treat stay here. There is a local supermarket within 100 yds if you need anything - they also have an excellent deli that makes tasty fresh sandwiches while you wait. Considered the Marquesa to be one of the best small hotels we've ever stayed in........That's a compliment. Review #23:From the moment we checked in, everything was perfect. We had a junior suite in newer building. Large and quiet with a mostly private lanai. Grounds are beautiful, employees very helpful, all details attended to. 2 pools. \"Nothing to complain about \" which is what we said when we checked out- can't always say that. Would stay there again without a doubt. A 5 star hotel. Review #24:I work in the hospitality business and the entire staff at the Marquesa achieved the highest level of customer service in the 2 days we stayed that we encourage our team to accomplish with each of our guest each and every day. Friendly, prompt, courteous, and extremely helpful- completely defines excellent customer service. I highly recommend and will return very soon. Review #25:While much of Key West is catering now to the cruise ship business and has become more and more honky-tonk, this lovely hotel retains the former charm and quaintness of Key West in an upscale fashion. The staff are all lovely; the grounds are beautiful; the rooms are sumptuous, and the hotel is centrally located. My partner and I had a great time there although the clientele is mainly straight. Our only complaints were that there were no premium cable stations which is odd for a place of this caliber, and that the unheated pool should be heated so there are more swimming options. Almost no one swam in the unheated pool. Otherwise, this is an exceptional small hotel. Review #26:With so many already positive reviews, I just have to ad that they go out of the way for special requests! This is a great model for anyone in the hospitality business. I have worked for the Disney Co, and they do a top job, I have seen pretty bad places to great places, and this is one of the ones I rate other by. Even I , and I am tough to please enjoy this property! Review #27:We paid around $290 for a corner room in the main building which faces the street. The room itself is quite nice and tastefully decorated with luxury soaps and shampoos in the bathroom. The hotel does not smell like a hotel. It feels more like staying in a very expensive house. We didn't use the pool itself but we went out in the evening and sat poolside. The pool area is beautiful and the landscaping is superb. The only negative with the room itself is noise from the street and doors opening/closing at certain times of day. It's not incredibly noisy because the location is off Duval but I expected less from this level of hotel. They should try to noiseproof the rooms overlooking the streets. As other reviewers noted, breakfast is not included which was dissappointing but there are good brunch places very close by. The location is ideal: two blocks off Duval in a safe area. After we parked, we never had to use the car for the weekend. Note that there are not enough parking spaces for all the rooms so you need a little luck getting a spot. The hotel service was good and the restaurant/tour recommendations were inline with the hotel class. In other words, they were good. We dined at the Cafe Marquesa one night. The food was very good except we had to wait 30 minutes for our table although we made reservations the previous day. However, they took care of us at dinner with a freebie and the service was outstanding. One other improvement is the internet access. They have wireless service but I had trouble connecting due to poor reception. Obviously, I didn't use it that much but you gotta have it. They seem to have a hotel computer you can use though. Overall, I would definitely recommend it even with the issues mentioned. We went at peak season so most decent places will charge $200+/per night. For a little extra, we got to stay at a very memorable hotel. Review #28:We had a wonderful stay at the Marquesa Hotel in May 2009. The hotel is situated two blocks off Duval (the main thoroughfare), which was a very convenient location for getting anywhere on the island. We stayed in a poolside standard room on the second level. The hotel was very quiet and felt very private, despite being located in the downtown. Our room was beautiful and extremely clean. The housekeeper came through twice a day to make sure it was well-appointed. Henry, a concierge, was so attentive to our needs and easy to work with. The pools at the Marquesa were fantastic! There are two (one heated, one not) located behind the hotel. They are surrounded by lush tropical gardens. Even though downtown Key West is just on the other side of the hotel, you would never know it with how quiet and serene the pool atmosphere is. Overall, we had a wonderful visit and would definitely stay at the Marquesa upon our return to Key West. Review #29:This was my first trip to Key West. My boyfriend visited two years ago. He stayed at a different location on Duvall Street which he said it was ok, nothing that nice, but it was clean. The place he stayed was alot more expensive too. When we arrived he said not to get too upset if it wasn't that nice. Boy were we both surprised! It looks pretty simple from the street. But once you go inside it is absolutely beautiful. The location couldn't be more perfect for all the sightseeing and nightlife. The staff is so friendly too. My only regret was that we couldn't stay longer. I'm so hoping we can return to Key West and I would not stay anywhere else but The Marquesa! Review #30:The Marquesa Hotel is perfection. It is the standard. Which is not to say you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay top dollar for the privilege of being a guest - you do, but it is not a regrettable expense. And while you are spending, do spring for one of the Jr. Suites. Go on - you've earned it. This visit was our second stay and certainly won't be our last. If I need to drive the point home, there is this: I am not even a particular fan of Key West, but I am a fan of the Marquesa. I'd like to say the biggest fan, but it seems that almost everyone who stays there is a repeat customer which is a positive review in itself. The Marquesa is private and quiet and clean - no spotless - and sumptuous and adult. And the staff really gives the impression taht they really love working there. And a hotel policy even gently recommends that guests avoid poolside cell phone conversations - my heroes! Review #31:Great place! Staff was awesome, rooms were perfect, overall great stay. We had junior suite #24 and it was fabulous. Pools were nice and they keep ice tea and towels out at the pool. The Cafe Marquesa next door was delicious! Every dish the table ordered was perfect and the service excellent. Could not say enough nice things about Marquesa. Book a room here with confidence. Review #32:MY wife and I are seasoned travellers from Northants in England. This beautiful hotel had all the Key West charm. We had room 9 right on the front. We had read in reviews that it could be noisy, but once we had set foot in our room/suite we didnot want to move. We would give it 5 star rating. It was light and airy from 5 sash windows and extremely well furnished. The pool area was tranquil and peaceful a little gem of an oasis one block away from the hustle and bustle of Duval Street. the staff were attentive and gave excellent service. The resteraunt was very good, but the night we went it was very noisey all the lady customers were trying to outshout each other. The rooms may be a little expensive to other hotels but worth every penny. Very highly recommended. Review #33:We just returned from our annual winter renewal trip to the Marquesa Hotel and Cafe Marquesa, marveling at how Carol and her wonderful staff keep making things better for us. Usually when you fall in love with a hotel or restaurant, you risk the very real chance of disenchantment when returning. Not only has that not happened to us in our 5 years of coming to this wonderful place, we no longer even fear it happening. As with every other visit, we find something new and delightful (in this case, poolside coffee and tea in the morning) to join the very long list of things we already adore, such as poolside ice tea during the day, wine and cheese on Saturday, beautiful decor, tropical gardens, delicious meals, and immaculate housekeeping. The best part of our visit remains the warm wlecomes and endless help from the staff, including Bob, Mary, Richard and Shaun. If heaven isn't like the Marquesa, we will be severely disappointed! Review #34:We stayed here two nights and couldn't get a third night so moved on to another hotel. This place is run beautifully. The breakfast in the courtyard is great, everything is immaculate and stylish, even the orchids are all blooming. The guests seemed a little uptight but management can't control that. For instance, one night three of us gathered on our porch at 6 pm to share wine before dinner and the woman in the adjacent room came out and said, \"Could you please keep it down- we're trying to take a before dinner nap!\" Not as if we were running our own karaoke machine, geez! Review #35:My wife and I stayed at the Marquesa for 2 nights. Highly recommended. Excellent service. Jr Suite was well appointed and roomy. Continental breakfast on the private porch in front of the room--easy to take. Duval Street is only 2 blocks away, so you have access to all that but a beautiful, quiet, private place to stay. Pools are small but beautiful landscaping, comfortable chairs, quiet. Dinner in the attached restaurant was very good with a nice wine list. All in all, nothing but praise for this property and the staff. Review #36:We just returned from our ten year anniversary celebration at the Marquesa. This was our 5th stay. Our first stay was when we married in Key West. The Marquesa has drastically slipped since our last visit two years ago. Our complaints are numerous. While the grounds are as lovely as ever, they have changed one of the pools into a \"heated therapeutic pool\". Who needs a hot pool in Key West? This forced the majority of guests to cram into the other pool. They added a flat screen tv to the room, but removed beautiful artwork and left holes unpatched in the wall. Who needs two tv's in the room, even our junior suite? They added a refrigerator in the bathroom under the sink that appeared to be circa 1970's. One night a leak sprung from the bathroom ceiling that was a result of the air conditioning drip pan overflowing. The next night wasn't much better with the air conditioner making noises like it might break at any time. We paid 400+ for this? The book of menus in the lobby contains menus for restaurants that have closed or moved from their listed locations years ago. Some menus date back to 2003 and older. Finally, we didn't expect anything special for our initial honeymoon at the Marquesa, however, after visiting repeatedly over the past ten years, any gesture would have been appreciated besides the ribbons on our table at the Cafe Marquesa for our over-priced anniversary dinner. We had a much better experience on our first visit to Morgan's Rock in Nicaragua, which we can highly recommend. Review #37:The Marquesa is a very nice, small hotel convenient to downtown but far enough away to avoid the noise and crowds. We stayed in room #1, which is a junior suite. Large, comfortable room with sitting area. Private and quiet. Landscaping on the property is very nice and pools, while small, are very nice as well. Great getaway, especially for a special occasion. Review #38:Great experience from start to finish. Wonderful historic buildings, great staff, outstanding pools and gardens. This is exactly what we were looking for when we booked our \"Adult\" vacation and left the children home. The Marquesa delivered on all accounts. We'll definitely stay at the Marquesa again on return trips to Key West. Review #39:We spent 6 nights at the Marquesa from July 3 to July 10. We were at the room #1 at the first floor. The room was very nice, clean , with a large bathroom and a living room (with sofa). Marquesa is conveniently located, within walking distance of mots interesting and attractive sites of Key West. Marquesa also offers parking facilities. We enjoyed a lot the two piscines as well as the tropical garden. We did not take the breakfast there but there are several opportunities in the surrounding (e.g. Sarabeth). For the dinner, include the Cafe Marquesa in your selection. Jo\u00c3\u00ablle and Eric Belgium Review #40:This is a lovely hotel, upmarket and stylish, with attention to detail. Attractive gardens with orchids and two pools. Top quality room. Didn't see a better looking hotel in Key West. Great location, central but quiet. Really enjoyed our stay. Review #41:This hotel is absolutely wonderful. It is within two blocks of Duval Street yet quiet and relaxing. The staff are very accommodating, the rooms are very well maintained, and the grounds are beautiful. We were upgraded to a suite, but all the rooms seemed quite nice. We walked everywhere as the location was so good. We would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to Key West! Review #42:Simply put, the Marquesa is an oasis of tranquility. Just one block removed from the happy craziness of Duval St., it soothes with its two beautifully landscaped pools and tastefully decorated rooms. The staff is attentive and detail orientated. They greet you as you approach the lobby, which is both welcoming and, I am sure, used as a safety precaution. They want to make certain you are actually staying at their hotel, and not simply wandering in off the street. Special thanks to Sean, who arranged both a sunset cruise and a snorkeling trip for us. Not knowing what September weather might bring, we did not book anything in advance and were pleasantly surprised by Sean's choices. We traveled as a group of three, and the two queen bedroom gave us ample room. The nightly turn down, the pitchers of iced tea and water by the pool and the option of both a heated and unheated pool all add to the hotel's charm. We were not accustomed to Key West's heat, and always returned to the hotel hot and exhausted, but were always delighted in our good fortune to stay at the Marquesa! It soothed our souls, and I can't think of any better compliment than that to the hotel and the staff. Review #43:This is our third stay at the Marquesa and the third time we loved it! Friendly staff from reservations--they worked hard to accommodate our date change and room preference--to keeping the grounds beautiful to reserving bikes and tours for us. The location is ideal. We enjoy being close to the grocery store and can walk to the movie theater and restaurants. But really, our favorite activity is sitting by the gorgeous patio and pools, drinking iced tea, and talking to fellow guests. Review #44:I have just returned from an absolutely wonderful stay at the Marquesa, where I am torn between determining whether the service, or the actual room was best. From the moment I called to place my reservation, I received first-rate, warm, and precise service. Really, flawless. This level of service is so unexpected that it really is such a pleasant \"shock\" to experience. The purpose of my trip to Key West (my first visit) was to explore the area, escape the mid-winter chill in the Midwest, and to have a fun time with a good friend. We booked two rooms adjacent to one another, and really used the Marquesa as our base of operations for heading out to nearby Duval Street and other popular Key West venues. We also enjoyed simply sitting on our veranda, listening to the soothing sounds of the courtyard, and quiet. My room was spotless - very clean, fresh linen and a comfortable bed, where i enjoyed a quiet night's rest. Bottom line: I travel all over the world, and have stayed in many legendary places. Marquesa is among the very best. Review #45:My partner and I were looking for a quick getaway to celebrate his birthday. We had specific criteria, we didn't want to travel too far, wanted warm weather and a great hotel where we could relax. We decided on the Marquesa Hotel based on reviews here on Tripadvisor and also articles from travel magazines. We have stayed in some beautiful and some historic hotels during our travels (Sagamore, Mohonk Mountain House, Biltmore, RIU, Hotel Palestine, Dromoland Castle, Princeville resort etc) and the Marquesa is most definitely in the top 3. We had suite #5, which was an absolutely stunning room. The doors opened up to a porch where we enjoyed breakfast and a view of one of the pools. The room had a huge bed, vaulted ceiling and the perfect size bathroom and always plenty of towels. It gave me some great ideas for when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ready to re-do my bedroom!! The pool was great fun, we found the non-heated pool to be most refreshing, always plenty of towels there too. The staff was extremely helpful when we needed them and we barely noticed them when we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We never saw the housekeeping staff but yet our room was made up when we returned from breakfast and our bed turned down and the lights on when we returned from dinner. The management of this hotel knows how to run a hotel. The Marquesa is perfectly located 2 blocks off of Duval. Close enough to walk to shopping and the nighttime action, but far enough away not to be disturbed by the noise. We have a long list of places we want to visit and the Marquesa is on the list to visit again. Oh yeah, Key West was a blast too! ! Review #46:We have stayed at The Marquesa for the last three years. The hotel is a beautiful, peaceful place to stay in Key West. The location is perfect for walking and biking. The Cafe Marquesa is a very nice spot for cocktails and dinner. It is an oasis with breath-taking waterfalls and landscaping with two pools. The entire staff's friendliness and helpfulness will make your stay very pleasant. We love a lot of things about Key West, but a stay here makes it even better. Review #47:We booked a long weekend at the Marquesa for our 10th anniversary. It was our first trip away from our children as well. From the first phone call to the moment we checked out it was absolutely perfect. The staff was very accommodating in every way. They booked dinners and other excursions for us. The room was clean and comfortable. The only thing missing was a coffee maker, I need that FIRST thing in the morning, but in Key West, my mornings start around 11 so it wasn't a complete negative. Pool area and gardens were immaculate. It was quiet, as they allow no young children, which was why we were there in the first place. Perfect location to Duval as well. You just can't go wrong here...............we will be back for sure. Review #48:We've been coming to Key West for 6-years. We have stayed at the Marquesa for the last four. This is the best place to stay in Key West. Excellent quality, beautiful rooms, lush landscaping, walking distance to everything (we never rent a car, only bikes). We took our adult daughter with us this year and had a very nice time. Room 20 gets nice morning sunshine on the porch. ... great for a morning cup of coffee in the tropical breeze. You gotta try this place! Review #49:A wonderful place to spend a birthday. This is our second time visiting the area. Service was excellent, staff was helpful and location perfect. We tried biking this year and found it a lovely way to see the island. We suggest you choose a room overlooking the pools and gardens so it is quiet and picturesque. We would highly recommend the restaurant attached to this hotel. The location is perfect. Review #50:everything is superb here: all little details in the main building, the garden around the pool, the porch of our room, the service. We spent two nights (28-29/09) of our two weeks in Florida and we wished we could stay more before traveling to Islamorada and Miami. After the check-in, Shion (?) took us to our room. It was on a second floor without elevator (it's an historic colonial style building). The room was fantastic, cozy with lots of space and light but we thought that we would have struggled with our two big and heavy luggage so the guy proposed us to move to the junior suite on ground level with private porch and luxurious bathroom and pay for the difference in rate. The extra price was not too high and we took it. At the end we spent fantastic moments there and it was by far the best place to stay. We did not use the pool because we stayed more on the beach and around, however it seemed fantastic and relaxing (guests are asked not to use their cells to avoid disturbing the other guests ;-). Even the complimentary coffee and tea in the morning is superb; same for the afternoon cold lemonade. There is even a private parking that's very handy in Key West Review #51:In this age of cookie cutter hotels, it's nice to find a place like the Marquesa. Charming, historical, tucked away from the noise but close enough to easily walk to all the action on Duval! We stayed in one of the junior suites (#6, which I would recommend) and enjoyed it immensely, from coffee and tea at poolside to coming back to our room at night and finding the bed turned down and chocolates waiting with the ice bucket filled. Very friendly staff. Our flight didn't leave until the evening, but when we checked out the manager told us to feel free to continue to enjoy the pool area as well as a separate bathroom and shower to clean up and change prior to our departure. Didn't get the opportunity to dine at the Marquesa Cafe but heard from others it is great. The Marquesa consists of the main building (built around 1884, as I recall), and several additional historical Key West homes that were apparently moved to the site. All nicely updated, and the courtyard pool areas and gardens are beautiful. Will definitely stay there again! Review #52:This was our first time staying at the Marquesa. The grounds are beautiful and very clean. The staff was always very accomodating and very polite. We have always stayed at the resorts so, it was a change in pace. Very quiet, very private, certainly recommended for couples, not really for children. Remember when looking at the reviews, you are staying in KEY WEST, things beat to a different drum in the KEYS, so go with it. We had the top suite which was by all means appropriate for the price. We certainly will go back as the staff goes out of their way to accomodate your needs. Review #53:We never expected such a lovely property--wonderful service, lovely pool and garden, staff that went out of their way to be helpful. Only problem is getting to Key West--it is a LONG drive from mainland Florida. But once you are at the hotel, you don't need your car at all. Would love to go back for a longer stay. Review #54:My husband and I just stayed at the Marquesa Hotel. We have stayed at other hotels in KW, but by far this is our favorite. From our check in to our departure, we had the most accomidating service. We loved the small, immaculate setting, from the pool and grounds to the rooms. We both love everything about the Marquesa has to offer, so close to everything on Duval Street, but far enough away that you feel like you are removed from the world. It's amazing. We will definetly be booking our trip next year at the Marquesa Hotel. Review #55:I would recommand this small hotel to everybody I know. It was super! Nice, clean rooms, very very nice staff (Richard), a wonderfull restaurant, well, everthing was just perfect! What I liked most was the intimacy, it's a small hotel, and the staff is really helpfull and knows you by name. One small thing which could be better is the breakfast. But still I would certainly come back! Review #56:One night was just a taste of how wonderful this hotel is - the building itself and all the furnishings were perfect. The courtyard and pools area is so inviting - it would be hard to leave if you wanted to do something else. In the morning, there was coffee and tea by the pool and in the afternoon, there was water and iced tea. The staff is excellent - we were escorted directly to our room by Henry. He brought us a bucket of ice and 2 complimentary glasses of wine - we thought that was a nice touch, especially since the Cafe was closed during our stay. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! And next time it will have to be longer than just one night. Review #57:Four of us moms stayed at the Marquesa for a long over-due girl's weekend getaway. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel is beautiful with two pools to choose from - and ice tea and water by the pool. It is in a great location within walking distance to Duval and other Old Town attractions. The hotel was quite and relaxing. Our room overlooked Simonton Street with a wonderful private balcony. The beds were also very comfortable. Review #58:This is the BEST Hotel in Key West hands down. Just a block off Duval Street you step into this cozy, charming, quiet retreat that is a true experience of totally relaxation! The staff was wonderful, kind, attentive and very professional. Our past trips to Key West we have stayed at the La Concha and the Pier House, both of those hotels don't even compare to the Marquesa. This will be the only hotel we stay at when we travel to Key West. Review #59:After going to a wedding in Miami we decided to go to Key West as an anniversary get away. We were very pleased with how clean the inn was when we arrived. We were helped with our luggage and told where we could park our car. The inn has it's own private parking lot. Our room was spacious and clean with updated decor and a mini fridge. The only drawback I found was that there was no mini coffee maker in the room. Since we had to do some business on our computer in our room when we were there that would have been nice to have. There is however free wi-fi in the rooms. We had a regular sized room and paid a lot since it was in season and the rates are higher. They have a nice lobby & they could have offered something more than magazines and a book of menus of all the restaurants in town. Even though our location was near the busy Duval shopping area the Inn was rather quiet except for the traffic on the street (since we faced the main road). A lot of of the tourists rent scooters in the area and we could hear them going back and forth. I would request a room towards the back next time. The pool area is very pretty and relaxing. They allowed us to take our own bottle of wine by the pool. They have a very elegant restaurant attached to the Inn that we did not try. The staff was very helpful with all of our requests. This inn looks more like a B&B than a hotel. It's almost like staying in someone's house. I think they are missing their mark by not serving coffee or juice in the morning as part of the package and maybe a plate of cookies & coffee in the evening. They get a lot of money for the rooms and it would cost very little to do this. Guests would remember this. Review #60:My family and I took a trip down to the keys from Miami this past weekend. We enjoyed our stay so much! The check in was personal, and the agent was extremely knowledgable of the hotel and the surrounding area. We were offered a complimentary glass of wine upon arrival, which we gladly accepted. The inside of the room was extremely clean, and went well beyond our expectations. We had a patio outside of our room which we used quite frequently for sitting outside and receiving our continental breakfast each morning. When we return to Key West, we will definitely be staying at this hotel again! Review #61:We spent 4 nights at the Marquesa in June as a celebration of our 10 year wedding anniversary. From the moment I called and made reservations, the staff was fantastic. After making the reservation, I later saw a special on the website for a free room upgrade and contacted the hotel. They graciously offered the upgrade and made excellent suggestions for dinners, sunset sails, etc. - better than any large hotel concierge I've ever encountered. We ate at Cafe Marquesa our last night there and were amazed by the attention and service at the restaurant. Our table had tasteful, festive ribbons to celebrate our anniversary and the food was amazing. I highly suggest a relaxing morning swim and breakfast before heading out for the day. The orchids and other plants surrounding the beautifully landscaped courtyard made our mornings in the back pool (heated pool) a peaceful oasis. As far as I could tell, it wasn't heated, or at least not noticeably so, because it was already so hot outside. Only caveat would be: if you have any mobility challenges, be sure to ask about your room location. Ours was on the 3rd floor so required climbing and descending narrow stairs. Next time I will spring for a poolside villa - they looked heavenly! Review #62:Love this hotel. It's perfect. Key West charm with very good style. Perfect location. In a quiet, beautiful neighborhood, but only 2 blocks from Duval. Beautiful pool area. Excellent service and very nice staff. Have stayed in all types of rooms, and they are all good. Review #63:My husband and I stayed here the last week in September as a last minute get away. The staff and accommodations were perfect. The pools were lovely and the restaurant was wonderful. Located close to all the action and local businesses work in tandem with the hotel to make everything as convenient as possible. Review #64:We stayed at the Marquesa in late Oct. along with another couple. This is a first class hotel! Our room was beautifully decorated and spotless. The employees & service was first rate! The grounds were imaculate and serene. Our friends stayed in a suite the was beautiful as well. The Marquesa Hotel is a quiet escape from the party on Duval St. but convinent to everything. We walked everywhere. Upon our return next year we will opt for a room in the rear of the hotel. No fault of the hotel, the street noise was a little much for us. We are from the country. Review #65:Just returned from our second stay at the Marquesa Everything was fine as usual,it really is an oasis of calm in Key West It's 2 blocks from Duval Street but could be 2 miles as it's so quiet. The staff keep it in perfect condition and for Shaun nothing is to much trouble. We will return as soon as possible keep doing what your doing please Review #66:We spent a week at the Marquesa and loved the location: central to everything, but far enough from the noise and less than congenial aesthetics of Duvall Street. We were able to walk to an abundance of fabulous restaurants, but found the best of all was the Cafe Marquesa in the hotel. The concierge service was great: they booked terrific scuba trips for our 17-yr-old son, bikes, and schooner trips for my husband and me, plus the trip to the Dry Tortugas. Beautifully appointed rooms and grounds, with attentive service. A true oasis in midst of old town. Look forward to our next visit. Review #67:We stayed many times before at this high-reputation hotel, but returning this Feb with friends we found that the mid-range price was now extended to the cheaper rooms. This means that although you book requesting the quiet rooms over-looking the pool, you can be swapped into either the smallest rooms on the pool or the noisy rooms in the old building. We had rooms 7 and 9 in the old house. Beautiful rooms, but 9 is right over the restaurant and was extremely noisy until 3am with the machinery, and 7 is at the stop-light of Fleming/Simonton and so has roaring engines all through the night. At over 400 dollars a night, having to take sleeping pills to get any chance of sleep is appalling. Our complaint was handled with shrugs of 'well, it's a noisy town' but we have stayed 4 times before and never had a noisy room. We were booked for March also, asked which rooms we had been given and found it was the same two, so we asked to be swapped out. They could only swap one room with an additional charge of 120USD+ per night. No attempt was made to retain our business until after I canceled the future booking. It hurt to know that now I was taking back the deposit they COULD make amends, but otherwise no effort would be made. I have a feeling that if you complain the most loudly of all the guests staying then you might get what you want, whilst some other poor soul is put into the punishment rooms. Know if you book here that you do not want rooms 7, 8 or 9, for noise (I don't know if the other rooms in the house have the same problem, but it IS likely) and that rooms 2,3,4,12 & 13 are very small. Review #68:We have been to the Marquesa at least 4 times over maybe a 6/7 year period or so. It is always a great spot but most important-it has maintained it's feel. There has been no drop off in appearance or staff support. I find it rare that a hotel that invested so much capital and tender loving care at the beginning can carry that feeling thru the years without a drop off in ongoing investment or staff attitudes. Review #69:My husband and I travelled to Key West this past week for a wedding. We were looking for some place relaxing and quiet and we knew that in Key West that would be hard to find. We found the Marquesa reviews and thought that this sounded just like what we were looking for. The previous reviewers told us the truth! The hotel was beautiful, very clean, the staff was friendly, polite and helpful. But probably the best part of the whole stay was the atmosphere. When you come in from the hustle of Duval street to a serene garden and pools and the only sound was waterfalls and palms shifting in the wind. The rooms were lovely and we even had our own private front porch overlooking the corner of Fleming and Simonton streets. I highly recommend the hotel and this will be the only place we stay on future trips to the island. Review #70:We just got back from a few days at the Marquesa and greatly enjoyed our stay. The pool areas are lovely and it was particularly nice to be able to relax outside on the suite's private balcony. One note: when reserving a room, be sure to request one away from the street. The noise on Simonton could be very loud at night. We were greeted with complimentary glasses of wine upon our arrival and the service was very attentive throughout our stay. We also enjoyed dinner at the Cafe Marquesa one night (although we had to wait for a table because they had us down for the wrong time). The food was excellent - probably the best meal of the trip. A few things that would have made our stay even better: (1) Breakfast really should be included in the price of the room. For $495/night, they could throw in a cup of coffee and some oatmeal. (2) Although it's possible that a small bar might affect the tranquility of the pool area, it would be nice to have a place to get a rum punch or beer while enjoying the sun by the pool. All in all, though, a wonderful stay at the Marquesa. Review #71:This was our second stay at the Marquesa Hotel. We love the accomodations, privacy, quiet pool area and the staff is very nice and accomodating. We brought another couple this year and they enjoyed it as well. The location is perfect for walking the duval and harbor street areas. Talk about being pampered! I love having the bed turned down and chocolate at my bedside! Who wouldn't! Can't wait to return next year. wisconsintravelers Review #72:Beautiful, quiet, perfect location. We especially enjoyed the lovely center courtyard with tropical vegetation and two pools and the friendly, gracious staff are exceptional. We needed to leave by 5:30 AM on our last day for a departing flight and the person on night duty took note and had coffee ready for us even though coffee service normally begins at 6:30 AM. We look forward to returning. Review #73:We had been informed by friends how good the staff were and what a beautiful hotel it was prior to our visit. We can confirm these statements were absolutely accurate. The hotel has a great deal of character, it is also extremely comfortable to stay in. Although it is situated in a relatively busy area it is easy to relax on your balcony or by the pool. The staff could not be bettered, they were 100% helpful and friendly. One of our friends fell ill a couple of weeks before our visit and the staff ( Dennis in particular) looked after him and his wife so well they really could not believe how fortunate they were to be staying at the Marquesa. Breakfasts are served in your room on your balcony, a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend anyone going to Key West, book the Marquesa you will not regret it. Review #74:stayed with our 14 year old daughter in a beautiful upstairs cottage suite.the rooms were elegantly furnished with a comfy king bed separated from a small living room area with a convertable couch which the staff turned down each evening.linens were top notch.marbled huge bathroom with a large soaking tub and shower.several orchids could be found on the small desk and night tables.small refrigerator and bottled water complimentry.the cottages surround a spectaculary pool garden area.the palms and foliage were astonding.beautiful flowering plants and potted arrangements made is feel that we had discovered the garden of eden. there is a small heated pool with a gentle waterfall and a second unheated pool.lots of lounge chairs and towels. it is amazing how quiet this hotel is and yet to close to the action.you can walk to anywhere.they also have a lovely upscale restaurant which should be sampled.beautifully prepared and delicious regional foods. the owners have spent a great deal to restore this hotel and certainly gave attention to every detail.it is lovely and perhaps the most special hotel we have stayed in. you will feel very welcome on arrival and regret leaving this wondeful hotel. Review #75:We've stayed in many places in key west over the last 30 years so to check into a place we had overlooked was a breathe of fresh air.I'm just going to give a basic overlay because I find long overblown posts tend to lose people's attention. Reception and the welcome is first class,and I mean first class! Rooms have everything,tastefully decorated and very comfy and cozy. Pool area is stunning,it made me sigh daily! Cleaning staff lovely and friendly and do a great job. We WILL definitely be back. Review #76:A wonderful find, just blocks from the \"fun\", we wish we could have stayed longer. The place was beautiful, the rooms were great, the attention to detail was amazing. From the time we arrived Shawn made sure we had everything we needed. When we came back from doing the \"Key West Crawl\" our room had been cleaned, fresh towels, ice, turn down with chocolate, trash removed-very impressed. The best part is that you are just a few blocks from the fun/noise and you return to a quiet, blissful place to lay your head. Review #77:My husband and I enjoyed our 3 night stay from 10/10/2011 celebrating our 48th anniversary. This is the third time we've been guests at the Marquesa Hotel. Our accommodations were excellent. No compalints from hubby or me! Everything was to our satisfaction. The staff made our stay a special one. We'll be back for another visit for sure! Review #78:We loved our stay at the Marquesa. You can tell from all the previous reviewers that it is a great place to stay, with the best service and beautiful grounds and rooms. There's one aspect of the stay that prevents the Marquesa from being perfect. If you are researching the hotel, you know that it is not inexpensive. When paying a certain price, it is always nice to feel like you are getting something a bit \"extra\", however small it might be. In the case of the Marquesa, I think providing a complimentary breakfast, if only something light, would be such a nice addition to their guest services. You can obtain a continental breakfast for $10, but it seems like a way to charge guests for something extra. Also, it would have been delightful to have some sort of snack offered with the afternoon iced tea. Good food often helps establish strong memories of hotel stays for us, if only a few freshly baked muffins and coffee. Review #79:From our complimentary glass of wine upon our arrival, to our room location, everything was great. We received a room upgrade which made it even more enjoyable. The room was nice and clean and had an outside porch. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the porch and surroundings. The outdoors are beautiful and peaceful. It would be the perfect place to have a family reunion or wedding. You can walk to Duval Street which of course is perfect, no driving and no taxi. The only negative was on the weekday mornings, we could hear the traffic outside our window....not enough to ruin our stay of course. Sean was great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! Review #80:Just returned from three nights in paradise at the Marquesa. This was our third visit and the place is just like going to heaven but you do not have to die for the honor. Beautiful room, great garden and two wonderful pools, attentive and friendly staff who take care of all your needs with a smile. One of the best places you could ever stay. The term \"first rate\" is an understatement when applied here. Review #81:We loved the Marquesa! The room and bathroom were large and immaculately clean. Really enjoyed sitting on our porch with a glass of wine at night. Check in was quick and easy. Parking could be tricky, it's on a first come basis, we, luckily, got a spot in the hotels covered garage which is attached to the property. The hotel is extremely quiet. So quiet, in fact, that it felt like we were staying outside the historical center, so relaxing! We hardly saw any staff yet everything was done to perfection and we never wanted for anything. I would be remiss not to mention the one negative spot in our stay: The sheets were very cheap,,,, to the point of being scratchy. In this day and age, even Hampton Inns are using high end sheets..... Just a suggestion that would make the hotel that much closer to perfect. Still, would recommend this hotel without hesitation! Can't wait to go back! Review #82:As a longtime visitor to beautifull Key West(20+years),with extensive national and international travel experience,it's time to express our views on the Marquesa Hotel. My wife and I travel annually (1-3 times/yr.) to K.W. Our stays have occured in most every month of the year,most recently December 27,2007 thru January 8,2008.,celebrating wedding anniversaries ,birthdays or what ever excuse we could dream up. Without exception,we can say the accomodations and ammenities at the Marquesa are always excellent.Recent upgrades have added even more to the Marquesa experience.The overall environment is serene and peacefull,the staff outstanding in every respect. From the moment of checking in, with a provided glass of wine ,tranquillity seeps in.The entire staff, Dennis, Bob,Richard, Drew ,Mary and Carol extend every courtesy to welcome ,and assure a wonderfull stay at Marquesa. From day 1- until departure, the housekeeping crew under the of leadership of Esther provides excellent and friendly attention to our every need and comfort ,and with a cheerful smile. The beautiful flowers, lush foliage , tranquil pools and waterfall ,create a serene surrounding & are reason alone for returning to the Marquesa Equally impressive ,stylish and fun the on-premise Cafe Marquesa is a splendid experience in beautiful K.W.Chef Susan presents a exquisite ,delicious and unique menu,beautifully presented in a casual ,sophisticated style.We would be remiss not to mention the awesome staff and wonderful service.Jeanette, the maitre-d along with Michael,Damon,Allison,Amy,David,Erin and our Meggie, all make the dining and invibing at the Marquesa --World Class and Fun. Combined the hotel and the cafe are a reprive from the all to busy world, but close enough to everything in KW. We will be returning yet again in Oct., Dec., Jan., & are looking forward to hearing \"Welcome Home\" -- which is what the Marquesa is all about. Review #83:We stayed here August 5-7th 2011 for my birthday. We were hesitant to stay some where new, and we are so glad we did!! The Marquesa is perfect! Incredibly clean with all the amenities you need. Very quiet, and concierge is very helpful and friendly. You are offered wine upon arrival, which we never took, and they settle you into your room. There are two pools and they have tea and lemonade out daily. We took alcohol and made our own cocktails to take by the pool. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious. It is very very secure at night. After 1 am, you have to ring the door bell to enter, which we had to do each night.. :) They do have a restaurant that smells awesome, but we didn't eat there, as we hopped bars/restaurants most of the time for light appetizers each time. The walk to Duval is short and everything is very close. Even the walk to Southernmost point isn't bad either. We had a pool side room with a shared porch, but very quiet.. room 12... Awesome room. I have no complaints, and had a great time. We are currently booking our December trip now, back to Marquesa!! ! Review #84:The Marquesa is always my first choice for Key West. It's exactly what you need- beauty and quiet by the pools and beautiful landscaping. Or a few minutes away from the shops and restaurants and activity of Duval Street. Everything you want is walking distance. Each time I've stayed there, everyone has been so helpful and accommodating. They are wonderful and extremely knowledgeable about restaurants and things to do in Key West. Rooms are always spotless and comfortable. I have stayed here several times and will continue to choose the Marquesa (unless it's a trip with kids). Review #85:I made reservations online but needed to cancel, which I also did online, 6 weeks before my scheduled stay. My cancellation was confirmed, I even received a cancellation confirmation number! Several weeks later I noticed that the Marquesa had not refunded by deposit, over $2200. I called the hotel and was informed that they were aware of my cancellation but would not refund my deposit. During that specific week (Fantasy Fest), they had a 60 day cancellation policy, rather than the usual 30 days. End of story: The Marquessa kept my entire deposit. Well, I never saw the 60 day cancellation fine print. More importantly, Marquesa Hotel did not contact me to verify my cancellation and make sure I knew that they intended to keep the deposit. Seems to me this would be standard business practice given the large deposit and amended cancellation policy. This may be a high-end boutique hotel but their business dealings are on the shady side. Sorry Marquesa, your greedy behavior may legal but it is most certainly dishonest. Buyer beware. Review #86:I have been to Key West many times and this was my first stay at the Marquesa....I was totally impressed. This was one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in. Just like other reviewers of this hotel, after a night of partying on Duval st, which by the way it is conveniently located to everything on Duval! !, it was nice to come back to this tranquil paradise. Pools were great, they don't have a pool bar but you can get your own booze right around the block at a local convenience store, and store them in your fridge or just ask the staff and they will get you a frozen margarita or whatever else you prefer from there restaurant. Staff was great, probably the kindest staff I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. My only regret was not trying there restaurant as I heard has gotten great reviews. I will save that for next time because I will be back and will definitely be staying at the Marquesa!! Thank you for a great trip! ! Review #87:The Marquesa is hands down the nicest, most romantic, most relaxing hotel we have stayed at together. The service was great and very personalized. We walked or biked everywhere from our hotel. And the cafe was so good we ate there multiple times for a delicious dinner. And the pool was perhaps the most beautiful spot on the island. We had a king suite, and the bathroom had a nice big tub, and the room was very spacious. The pool side rooms looks great as well. I highly recommend this hotel for any couple staying in Key West. Review #88:This small guesthouse continues to deliver a top notch vacation experience. It's well located near the noise and bussle of Duval Street, but it is a quiet place with beautiful grounds and 2 pools. Rooms are well appointed. The junior suites have plenty of room for rest, reading and dining on a generous patio. Staff is helpful and friendly. Hotel is 1 block from a grocery store making meals on your terrace easy and fun. This was my first time visiting during the on season. Weather was great and no humidity. The only thing I noticed is that during the on season the guests tended to be more in the 60+ age group and there were less folks under 50. This maybe is reflective of rates and school vacation schedules. Review #89:As many of you know, there many choices of accomodations in Key West. Living in South Florida, Key West is our \"mandatory\" vacation place, but we do not take anything for granted when it comes to the accommodations. We have stayed at the Marquesa 7 times in the last 5 years and we NEVER been dissapointed by the staff or the property in general. This hotel is absolutely beautiful with well appointed rooms, it is truly an oassis. Most of the comments here are very positive but then again you can never please everyone. Fantasy Fest is by far the most popular \"holiday\" on the island and if you are going you must make reservations several months ahead and sometimes a year in advance depending as to where you want to stay. If you are going to cancel your reservation it needs to be done 60 days prior to your arrival, please read the hotel policy on their web site. The 60 day policy for cancellation is the concensus on the island, period. At The Marquesa children over 14 are welcome, younger children are not. Not often, but guest disregard this policy and arrive with small children what is the manangement to do if there is not a possiblity of finding other arrangements? It is a quandary and I would not want to be in that possition. I personally never had to worry about that one. Like I said before, one can never please everyone but at The Marquesa they try in more ways than one and I for one would not stay anywhere else and by the way the restaurant stands up to any fine dinnig establishment in Miami or Palm Beach but less pretentious. The hotel and restaurant is the best of the best in Key West. Something that all potential guest should be aware off: This hotel IS not for the frat crowd and/or singles doing the Duval Crawl, so if this what you want or need to do The Marquesa is not for you. Review #90:The staff was truly committed to ensuring that our accomodations and our trip in general was perfect. The hotel is lovely and centrally located and no kids under 16. The restaurant had excellent food and an efficiant, pleasant wait staff. I would definitely stay there again. Review #91:My partner and I had a very nice stay at the Marquesa. We were upgraded to a large suite on the top floor of the main house. It was a comfortable room with a large bathroom and lots of places to sit. Next time we would get a room with its own balcony, because the only way you could relax outside was at poolside, and sometimes we wanted to be outside with a little more privacy/quiet than the pool. The facilities were all immaculately clean. Two pools -- one cooler than the other, depending on your mood -- and plenty of seating and tables. It was generally very quiet Despite their no-kids policy, they did allow a toddler to stay while we were there. It wasn't a major problem for us, but I talked to at least one guest who stayed at the Marquesa specifically to avoid kids on her vacation and I'll bet she was not happy. We'll definitely be coming back to the Marquesa given its cleanliness, the friendliness of its staff, and its convenience to all the attractions. Review #92:I took a guys trip to Key West in Nov 2010 and we stayed at the Marquesa Hotel. I would love to return with my wife. The hotel was quaint and romantic - completely wasted on our group. The location was great. Easy walking distance to the main drag and everywhere else. There was secure off-street parking and easy check-in. Our rooms were great. They were well appointed and the linens were very comfortable.The bathrooms were large and included all the necessary toiletries. Best of all, our upstairs room included access to a large porch overlooking the street. This was perfect for having happy hour. The pool was a nice place to hang out. It was anything but crowded. The only thing missing was a jacuzzi. A small business center was perfectly adequate for our needs. I did not check out the exercise facility. There is a restaurant on property which looked very nice. It also looked a little pricey, but probably has food worth the cost. We had other restaurants on our agenda and so did not try this. The staff was friendly and helpful. We consulted with them regarding fishing, etc. and they had much useful information. If I go back to Key West I would happily return to the Marquesa. Review #93:My wife and I watched a short but alluring documentary on Key West and the Marquesa on the Travel Channel a few years ago. Knowing we wanted to plan a first time Key West get-a-way in the future, I kept the Marquesa tucked away in the back of my mind. Being very particular and at times intolerant , I have to say that our stay was as good as it gets. The staff was very courteous, and most attentive. Our favorite member of the staff was Mary who spent as much time with us as we needed in mapping out our daily itinerary to shops, galleries, restaurants, sightseeing highlights, bicycling paths, historic homes, and etc. PS.... she even made all the restaurant reservations for us as well as the sunset cheese and wine cruise we enjoyed so much. Although we had a convertible for transportation, we preferred using our rental bicycles because of the Inn's strategic location in Old Key West where all the action was. We happened to stay in the main house on the third floor. The room was very spacious with a separate sitting area with its own dedicated TV in addition to the 24\" LCD adjacent to the queen size bed. The grounds are very private and nicely tucked away from the rest of the world. Lush, spacious and very well maintained as was our room. Although I know its not because we inquired, our room looked like it was just redecorated from scratch because everything looked new. What we also found very atypical was that our used towels were replaced twice a day, once when the room was made up in the morning and then again in the early evening when the bed was turned down and garnished with chocolates. Bottom line, we'll be going back to Key West and the Marquesa. We were so impressed, we even took pictures. Review #94:My husband and I visit the Marquesa every year. Everyone from the General Manager, office staff, restaurant manager and her staff, housekeepers and grounds personnel greet us with open arms. It like being welcomed back to your hometown but in a much warmer climate. The property is as beautiful and well kept as any you will find. The service is outstanding, the restaurant recommendations always on target. Requests are always greeted with a smile and handled with speed and efficiency. After a recent stay of nine nights this year, I changed our return flights because I just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring myself to leave the Marquesa just yet. My husband and I never check-out without booking next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation. That way, good year or bad, we know that we have at least 10 days of perfection to look forward to! Review #95:The hotel is located in a perfect area of Key West. Shopping and restaurants are walking distance from the hotel. The hotel restaurant was fabulous and the staff at the hotel were very attentive and took time to tell you about Key West. The hotel was immaculate with turn down service every night. We will definitely come back again! Review #96:i would highly recommend the marquesa hotel. it's perfect for couples and our stay was great. the hotel itself is gorgeous...very clean and quiet, perfect for relaxing and chilling out. the grounds are stunning with lavish greenery and two swimming pools. would recommend ordering breakfast for beside the pool...! the room was very spacious and had everything that we needed. they really have thought of everything! the staff were really accommodating and friendly...we arrived a day early due to a change in our travel plans and they were able to facillitate us. they also provided us with all the information and maps for key west that we needed. our only regret was not having enough time to eat at the marquesa cafe...next time! Review #97:The hotel left nothing left to be desired..it had it all!!!! Everything we needed and asked for was provided. The grounds are beautiful. The staff is attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable (thanks Keith for all of the suggestions). The junior suites are roomy, clean, beautifully decorated and comfortable. Each one has a front porch where we enjoyed a continental breakfast almost every morning. The location is great for walking into town or just around the harbor area but still not far from the Southernmost Point. Review #98:The Marquesa is a brilliantly renovated group of late-Victorian homes a block or so from Duval Street. The main building (which houses a few of the rooms, the office, and the delicious Cafe Marquesa) opens to an intimate and beautifully landscaped pool area around which the remainder of the guest rooms and suites cluster. We stayed in a Junior Suite (comfy kingsize bed, separate parlor with hideabed couch, spacious bath) and it was like a high-end boutique room. Each bungalow-like accommodation is equipped with a small refrigerator/honor bar, two flatscreen color televisions (in case you can't find enough to do in Key West), CD-player alarm clock, hair dryer, and coffee maker. As if all of that wasn't enough, add ceiling fans, robes, and (gasp) an umbrella to fend off the occasional tropical rain plus a cozy porch for outdoor relaxation to the class-A staff, and you have the perfect accommodation for a quick weekend or a longer stay. Designated parking is sparse, but the location means you shouldn't have too much trouble finding space if you miss out on one of the property's 16 first-come spaces. The Marquesa makes me not even care to look at any other properties for future visits. How can they possible be better? Review #99:My husband and I recently stayed at the Marquesa Hotel in Key West. The service was outstanding and the room (a junior suite) we stayed in was beautiful and comfortable. The pools were great and sitting around the pool was very enjoyable. We asked for some recommendations for day trips and the staff was very helpful and arranged for a day trip to the dry Tortugas. I would highly recommend this hotel; also the perfect location. Not on Duval Street but 2 blocks away, which is a good thing.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

This hotel lured me to book with it with its relatively lower price, nice photos, and good reviews. It turns out that the hotel IS pretty great. The front-desk staff was pleasant and helpful (we had to store our luggage with them for a day after checking out and there were no problems), the lobby was gorgeous, the breakfast was top notch (and free! ), and our room was perfect, with silky smooth bedsheets, a clean bathroom, and ample space. The only problem is when you step outside to use the pool and hottub - the swim-up bar is cute and the hamburger fare offered there is good (albeit a bit too salty), but every ten minutes it sounded like an airplane was about to crash-land on your head. I could not believe how noisy it was, and I've lived near LGA airport all my life. It was literally like the planes were landing next door (and I guess they sort of were). Fortunately, the hotel itself is well insulated, so the noise doesn't affect you at all when you're inside. If it weren't for the noisy pool, the hotel would be an easy A+ (and probably cost a lot more). As it is, I give it an A-. Review #1:My husband and I flew down to San Juan for our friends' wedding this past weekend. Since we knew we couldn't make this trip any sort of vacation, and to call it a getaway was pushing it, we wanted to stay somewhere clean, comfortable and efficient. We got that and so much more! The location was perfect. It's right across the street from the El San Juan hotel (site of the wedding), a Walgreens and Lupi's, a Mexican restaurant recommended to us (it did not disappoint). Plus, the value is the best I've seen in a long time. There's the free breakfast (not gourmet or cooked to order, but there were plenty of options and everything tasted good), the lovely pool area with swim-up bar and grill with burgers so juicy they rival those at In-N-Out and Five Guys, the comfy bed, the flatscreen TV with all the channels of home as well as a plethora of Spanish-speaking ones, the business center and the efficiency of check-in and check-out that could not be beat. Obviously it's not the best choice if you want a luxurious, long-term vacation. This is because it's not on the beach (but it's a block away), and if you want a poolside cocktail, you need to get up and get it yourself rather than have a waiter bring it to you. But I'd recommend this hotel to folks who either are in town briefly for an event or who need a place to stay before or after a cruise. Although, I must say we're tempted to stay here even for a full-on vacation after reading the horrible reviews about the cleanliness and service at the El San Juan hotel. The El San Juan is THE place to be for dancing and partying (and weddings -- the wedding we attending was fabulous), no doubt, but even we noticed dirty couches and an overall indifference of the staff when it came to actually doing their jobs. Review #2:I stayed with my bf. The bedroom is big & clean, the bed is super comfortable & king size, have a very good size TV, the bathroom was ok, but the bathtub was a bit small. The beach is 5 minute walk & you can find various fast foods near the place so you dont have to waste money. Overall, I had a lovely, fun & romantic experience. Can't wait to go back. HIGHLY RECOMENDED! Review #3:We just needed a place to stay for one night between getting back from Vieques and flying out of San Juan. This was a great place for that. The room was lovely and was air conditioned and had a TV with cable, which was nice after being in various locations around PR for 10 days. It was more of a suite than a room, with a living room area with a wet bar and then a separate room that was a bedroom. Both rooms had tvs. It was very close to the airport and the breakfast was nice and included with the room. We would definitely stay here again to be close to the airport, though if this is the only place you stay in PR, you are missing the best part. Review #4:This hotel was very nice and clean and the staff was very nice. However, the Isla Verde area is quite dumpy and I felt nervous walking around it. Also, the airplanes are way too loud and ruin the atmosphere. I was with my sister and our children and we were hit on more than once by some shady looking guys which made me really uncomfortable with our young children around. The beach in Isla Verde was dirty and stinky. We didn't even get wet. We stayed at this hotel because we had an early morning flight. I would only recommend staying there if you need to be close to the airport. We also stayed 4 days at the Carbie Hilton, which was very nice. If they could move the hotel to a nice part of town, I'd stay there again. Review #5:One of our better choices without breaking our budget . Clean and modern facility which even included breakfasts. We would have a quick breakfast and be gone all day seeing the island. Often didn't return to our room till late at night and were never disapponted with the hotel. Great facilty for familes - kids always were in the pool having fun. Review #6:This is a very nice hotel, We love ti, is very private, Front Desk all the agents there are very nice and friendly specially Dianna, she's always wealling to help. Housekeeping is excellent! Maintenance is great! this hotel is very clean, smells good, the pool is very confortable, the rooms are very nice, very clean and the beds are awesome! This hotel is very nice, confortable and customer service is great! Review #7:We stayed at Hampton Inn for one night pre-cruise. It was a quick 10 minute ride from the airport and about 20 minute drive to the Pan Am cruise pier. The morning of checkout we found an employee outside who was helping guests get cabs and we had no trouble finding one immediately. The rooms were quiet, in spite of the proximity to the airport. There are many restaurants within walking distance. We walked across the street and were on a beautiful beach within just a few minutes, where we enjoyed pleasant walk, then into the casino of the El San Juan Hotel for a little gambling in their casino. Then into the pool and hot tub for more evening relaxation. The Hampton staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! When we asked a question, they would respond and always add \"...is there anything else I can do for you?\" The breakfast buffet was excellent and plentiful, with lots of seating area and tables for everyone. Hampton exceeded my expectations and I would definitely stay there in the future. Review #8:Have stayed at this hotel twice pre cruise and loved it. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms a clean and comfortable. Location is very good 5 minutes from airport and a short walk to the beach. We find this hotel to be the best value for your dollar and have it booked again this year pre and post cruise, which we are very much looking forward to. Review #9:We were here for one night post cruise just to relax and we were delighted with the service and amenities. Wireless internet is a plus after being without for a week. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The location was decent just a two block walk to the beach and the main street. The beach was very nice. Would stay here again especially for the price booked with hotwire. Review #10:This is a fine location for a quick stopover in San Juan. The clean, nicely furnished hotel is in the Isla Verde tourist district immediately adjacent to the airport, close to several casinos and numerous eateries. People sensitive to noise should try to avoid rooms in Tower A, which is closest to the airport runways and immediately next to a cock fighting arena whose combatants greet the dawn collectively. Review #11:This is a great place to stay. Although there is airplane noise out at the pool, it was rarely heard inside. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The breakfast is great. The pool is wonderful and well kept. There are lots of good restaurants at the big hotels nearby but be prepared..they are pricey! all in all, we really enjoyed our stay here!! ! Review #12:Prior to going to this hotel I did read a negative review about bedbugs; and the first thing I did when I got into the room was check for them--nothing! But what I will say is this, the hotel was very clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful; and the breakfast was excellent. Each morning we were up at 6 am, and at breakfast by 7:30 am. ; it was empty, quiet, and a pleasure. I grew up with parents who always left the hotel maid a tip, and I am no different, but I was really surprised that my maid, (her name is Blanca) did not take my tip; and I was curious why? Unfortunately, she didn't work on the weekends! Walgreens is right across the street, and also on that side of the street you can keep straight, veer off to your left, and you are on the beach. Its a beautiful beach, and is great for early morning risers and rising sun seekers. Loved it, and its really less than a 5 minute walk, at best. We also rented a car with Alamo, and the hotel charged only $5 a day for parking. Overall, it was a good hotel to stay at. Review #13:I took my two college age kids for a Chrismtas vacation and this hotel was very adequate and priced great. The beach is a few blocks away and there area ton of shops and restaurants close as well as a supermarket a few blocks away. It was a very safe area and i would recommend if you have a tight budget to stay here. Review #14:I think this is the nicest Hampton Inn we have stayed at. We paid in the mid 250s because everything was booked Presidents's Day weekend, but we were totally pleased with the hotel. I had previously stayed at the Hilton Caribe and really liked that - its a better location for getting to Old Town - but the Hampton is opposite the street from the Ritz and other hotels, allowing more access to restaurants, casinos, etc. The hotel is very clean (far more so than the four star El Conquistador Resort, for example!) and the beds are as good as the best Westin beds. The breakfast is an actual hot breakfast, plus so many other choices of cereals, juices, breads, and bagels, fruit, yogurt, granola, etc. - better than most Hampton Inns. The rooms were quite, the pool looked nice (we did not use) and the staff were helpful. I highly recommend this hotel over many four star establishments in Puerto Rico! Review #15:We just came back from beautiful San Juan and I have to tell you guys the hotel was almost perfect...buffet breakfast,reasonable price,kind and charming staff,pleasant pull (little bit dirty though ) good location...but....bed bugs!!!! I can't stop scratching my self!! So now you know, and I believe not every bed is infected ,but mine was...:( and yes internet was impossible to use cause it was too slow. Review #16:We stayed at the Hamtpon Inn & Suites for spring break and had a wonderful experience! It's a great hotel for the price, not to mention in a good location. The staff was very nice and offered lots of suggestions for places to eat and have fun; they also had answers to all our questions. The Business Center with free internet and printing was a nice surprise, and there was also wireless in the room. The hotel overall is well-kept and clean and the beds are small but comfortable. When I go back to Puerto Rico, I will definitely book at the Hampton Inn! Review #17:We got stuck in San Juan after being bumped off our flights all day long. We fly stand by, so we're not eligible to have our hotel paid for by the airline. We had just spent 4 days at the Embassy Suites Dorado del Mar, and had been at the airport since 5 AM. The last flight left at 7:45 PM without us on it and so we called around to find a hotel. We got to the Hampton Inn & Suites around 9 PM. We were exhausted. Since we are a family of 5, a room with 2 beds doesn't accomodate us. After explaning our situation with being stranded and having sat with 3 kids at the airport all day, I asked for a roll away and was told it was going to be another $20 or we could switch the room type and have a pull out couch for an additonal $40. The room rate was already pretty steep. Our rate for a suite at the Embassy Suites in Dorado which included 2 beds and a pull out couch on a beautiful resort property was less before these additonal charges even! We declined both and took the standard (overpriced) room. Our teenager slept on the floor. The room was nice, but a little worn. The walls had scuff marks on them everywhere and the furniture is pretty banged up. Also, the room is pretty cramped. The pool and the pool bar were right out side of our window, so it was a little noisy. We went back downstairs and asked if there was anywhere to eat. The front desk employees were friendly and helpful and gave us a lot of options of places we could walk to for dinner. We returned and went to sleep and checked out the next morning at 5 AM. This hotel is nice, but definitely overpriced. Review #18:We stayed at this hotel for one night. We booked through travelocity. We were delayed one night and travelocity said the hotel would not refund us our money for the night, so oh well, live and learn. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The room itself was pretty clean except for some black marks on the walls. I didn't complain because I was so exhausted from sleeping at the (ATL)airport the night before. I would stay here again for one night but if I was planning a longer stay in San Juan, I would pay the extra money for a four or five star resort. Review #19:This hotel has to be a sleeper. We have stayed in San Juan on 4 previous occasions over the past 10 years prior to cruising and this is by far and away the best hotel we have experienced. Not only is it less expensive than where we stayed in the past, the rooms (suites?) are larger - about 500 sq ft if you choose a poolview room - the entire hotel is spotless, it's within walking distance from many restaurants, other hotels, car rental agencies, and the beach which incidentally we don't think is that good. The modest comp breakfast satisfies, the burgers at the pool bar are super and the airport noise is a non issue in the rooms due to excellent double paned windows. Forget the over pricing at the hotels with casinos on the beach, you can walk to 3 of them from the Hampton and it's more comfortable. Review #20:We stayed at this place for 2 days...really a nice place to stay and is very near to airport aswell Old san Juan...checked in real quick..and the receptionist was very helpful in giving the maps and directions to Old San Juan...there was WIFI in the room...room service was good ..the only issue was the noise from the AC was not sure was this the problem with all the rooms or only with that of ours..:( and served the continental breakfast.The area nearby was gud for wandering..all together a nice place to stay... Review #21:We stayed here last Sunday for one overnight after disembarking from a 7 day cruise. This was our second stay here and it met our needs perfectly. We arrived at the hotel at about 8:30am and no surprise, there was no room ready for us. That was okay because we then took a ride (we rented a car from Avis after getting off the ship) to El Yunque rain forest and explored for a couple of hours. When we returned, the room was ready and we hung out at the pool for a while. We did plan to take advantage of the poolside grill for dinner, but when I walked up and ordered two burgers I was told that it would be at least an hour wait. Hmmm...we went to plan \"B\" and walked down to the beach/pier and went to a nice little restaurant instead - \"La Playita.\" Our flight home was at 10:30am Monday so we had a leisurely morning to finish packing and have breakfast before the 5 minute ride to the airport. We had none of the problems listed in some of the prior reviews. I did not give it 5 stars because it is not a 5 star hotel. It's clean with a friendly staff and typical Hampton Inn amenities. We paid $190 US for this night. Staying that one extra night saved us about $400 on airfare, and twist my arm, I had to stay in Puerto Rico for one more night. It was a great addition to a wonderful vacation week. Review #22:Although this hotel costs more than I usually pay for Hampton, it is worth it. It is modern and clean as a pin. The location is excellent. It is a few steps from the beach and near many restaurants. The rooms have large flat screen tvs with adequate cable. There is free wifi and wired internet. They have a good breakfast with some hot items changing daily. What really makes this place special is the people running it. Although there is no conscierge, the front desk fills in admirably. They are anxious to make your stay pleasant and productive. Review #23:Perfect stop pre-approved by the flight crews! Stayed one night, Oct 6. Arrived early enough to enjoy the clean pool and tasty poolside grilled lunch of cheeseburgers and fries prepared to perfection, a bargain at $8. No South Beach diet, but we were on vacation. True, during the day the jets landing on the adjacent runway will momentarily shake your bones, but they don't fly at night. Took a cab to the fabulous (by any standard) Plaza las Americas Mall for the highest quality shops we've seen anywhere in the continental U.S., with better prices, too. The Hampton Inn rooms are spacious, safe and clean with very comfortable beds and all bedclothes are washed daily. Windows are double-paned to reduce noise, but I would request a room on the left wing as you face Reception farther from the runways if you want to nap during the day. Really, at night the noise is not a problem. The airlines would not put their crews there unless it was clean, safe and quiet and a good price close to the airport. Also, 2 blocks away is a fabulous, free, white powder sand beach with gentle waves, possibly the best beach we've ever enjoyed. This place could be a destination unto itself. Lots of good restaurants within safe walking distance. Prefer this to Old San Juan any day. Review #24:I have had several extended trips to San Juan this year, and I will only stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites on busy Isla Verde Avenue. It is close to the airport, where I was working, but also close to the beach and several restaurants, all within walking distance. There are also several other shops nearby for the everyday conveniences. Most nights I didn't even leave the hotel since there is a poolside bar and grill outside. Even though I was there on business, my evenings felt like a vacation. This hotel has all the Hampton Inn conveniences while maintaining the lad back Caribbean vibe. Review #25:Nice and clean, friendly staff, beautiful decor with a tropical theme through out the place. Pool was abit small and loud from the planes, but we wanted to be near the airport. The poolside bar and grill was fantastic thier burgers were nice and juicy with lots of flavor- only 6.50$( came with a side dish) No problems getting a reasonable cab to the airport. A short walk away you can go to the beach. Review #26:We had decided that we wanted to stay an extra night in Puerto Rico to visit more of the island after we completed our Carribean cruise. We found this hotel through hotels.com and carefully read the reviews before we left. Since the overall rating was good, we decided to book. And we were happy to see that we had made the right pick. Check in was fairly quick even though there was a long line-up upon arrival. Parking cost less than $6 tax in for guests.The room was beautifully furnished with top notch furniture and comfortable bedding. The business center had three computers with complimentary internet access (very slow though at times). Complimentary breakfast offered waffles, eggs, sausage, all types of breads, coffee cakes, cereals, fresh fruit, orange juice, and good coffee. Everything was delicious except for the sausage which looked really dry and not too apetizing. Great location, 5 minutes walk from beach and about 15 minutes from airport. Hotel has a beautiful jacuzzi and outdoor pool with pool bar. Pool towels are provided even when we went to the beach. The pool bar also prepared barbecued food and we absolutely LOVED their baby-back ribs made by Jay. Remember that name, cause he is the guy you want behind the grill and who will make the difference in your appreciation of this meal. He is such a pro at this and trust me you won't eat any other ones like these! Chicken burger was also very tasty and juicy as well as their hamburgers. Salad side dish was not very generous, so we ommitted the chips and asked for more greens, which they happily did. Drinks are very cheap. We stayed at a different hotel when we arrived in Puerto Rico the day before our cruise and we were very disappointed, even though the cost was very comparable. So this one is definitely a keeper! Review #27:Clean rooms, wonderful front desk staff, great breakfast buffets. I had one small problem with my phone and one of the maintenance personnel overhead my comment. Next thing I know, he's upstairs fixing the phone! What service! Very personable staff - always friendly and polite. I can't say enough about them. The Tuesday night buffets are okay - get there early because the food does run out! The food by the pool area is good. As with everything in Puerto Rico, make sure you allow plenty of time - it's definitely NOT fast food! Close to the airport, but you can't hear the noise unless you're by the pool. You really can't go wrong here! Review #28:My wife and I went on a cruise and stayed at the Hampton Inn for a few days beforehand so we could see San Juan. The inside of the hotel, especially the rooms, are beautiful. It is a nice looking place and service was good. The breakfast was so-so, not bad, but definitely not great either. My primary reservation with the hotel was the price: 1) Nothing says class like a cock fighting arena outside your window. 2) Going to the beach is a 10 minute walk and once you get there, it is not automatic that you will find a beach chair. 3) A taxi to Old San Juan is $20 each way. We took the public bus for $0.75 each, but it took roughly 50 minutes each way. 4) When at the pool, you could almost feel the wind from the jet engines. None of these are deal-breakers, but I thought the price of $200 a night was a little high (it felt like a $120 hotel). I talked with someone in a nearby restaurant who was at the Courtyard about 5 minutes away, and he paid $20 less a night and was on the beach. If I did this again, I think I would definitely try this next. Review #29:I stayed here for three nights, April 20th to 23rd, 2010. I stayed in room # 333. I paid $ 135 USD per night. This hotel belongs to the Hilton family of hotels. I really enjoyed my stay. My room was a one King bed room. Great bed, clean linen. The room was very clean. I had free WiFi internet in the room. Free breakfast was included in the price. I have read that other guest's paid $ 5 USD for parking. I had a rental car, and, the front desk always validated my parking ticket, everytime I wanted to depart the hotel. I don't think the front desk makes this function known, and, those other guest's probably never asked. The palapa bar out by the swimming pool, is a great place to un-wind every night. They do grill up some nice meals there for you, along with refreshing drinks. The only planes I ever heard taking off or landing, was when I was out at the palapa bar. When in my room, I never heard any jet noises at all. I definately recommend this hotel to everybody. On my future visits to Puerto Rico, I will be booking this hotel again. Review #30:Room is good. (King suite facing pool). Average condition, few amenities (no bar, restaurant, etc...except pool bar w/food outside). Quiet...except for some airport noise and loud voices from adjoining room through closed doors. Typical free Hampton breakfast buffet. However, lousy neighborhood. Run down, dirty streets and buildings. Nearby beach is dirty with piles of sea weed. Next time I would pay the extra for Condado area resort hotel or stay in Old San Juan. It's $50 round trip cab, incl tip to Old San Juan, where all the city's character is. Spend a day touring Old San Juan, impressive castles/forts, neat streets and shops. $19 plus tip to Pan American cruise ship dock from this hotel. Review #31:My wife and I spent a long weekend in Puerto Rico to visit with our son who had been working here for the last several months and to get a break from the cold. We chose the Hampton Inn after reading the reviews here. I have to say that this hotel exceeded my expectations. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast in the lobby each morning was just right, it saved time and money. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I don't know if I would recommend this someone who was looking for more of a resort stay. I think if you came to Puerto Rico and only stayed in the vicinity of the hotel, you would miss a lot of the charm and beauty of the island. We used this as a base to operate from and traveled all over the island. There is a lot at the hotel though; Walgreen's across the street and several restaurants in walking distance. A two block walk to the beach was not a problem. When we went to that beach I noticed a resort with umbrellas and lounge chairs approximately 100 yards from where we set up our towels. I walked over to get a better look and discovered that it was the Ritz-Carlton. I'm certain that none of the people there paid $179 a night to get to that beach. The pool, hot tub and swim up bar at the hotel were great. You could spend your vacation there and have a great time. On Monday we took the 75 cent bus trip to Old San Juan and explored. The desk clerk gave us excellent advise on which bus to take and also told us to take the free trolley to the farthest point out once we arrived at the bus station. That way we could work our way back through the city going downhill. That worked out great. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Review #32:We stayed here for just one night after a late arrival into San Juan. The cab ride from the airport to the hotel was $12-$15. The room was a little small for a Hampton Inn, but still very comfy. We had enough room with our baby's travel crib to use the desk and lounge chair all at the same time. Very comfy bed, great water pressure, & nice continental breakfast. The pool area with bar looked really nice, but we didn't stay long enough to try it. The price was reasonable compared to the other options in the area. Review #33:Stayed here mid Nov and loved it. The outside pool bar has great. The food is outstanding and the drinks were reasonably priced. Room was clean and quiet. Great location walk to beach, walgreens, restaurants. Safe neighborhood. Hotel parking $10 a night Review #34:We have stayed at the Hampton Inn a few times before, and it was always only for a night or two before a cruise. The hotel is nice, but I wouldn't want to stay for longer than a few nights, seeing as there's not a ton to do. The location is pretty good, there are some nice restaurants and a beach nearby. The pool is good. You can get food, like burgers and grilled cheese, from the bar near the pool. There's a hot tub too and lots of chairs to sit on. The rooms are pretty good. They have a good amount of space, we could fit our whole family of five in one room, which had two queen beds and we had a rollaway as well. The first time we stayed here we had a nice view of the pool, the second time we had an ugly view of the parking lot, but we didn't mind much. Breakfast is great. It's free and a buffet is set up so you can get your breakfast in the lobby. They have coffee, cereal and fruit as well as some hot food like sausage and eggs, as well as toast. For other meals you have to eat at the bar by the pool or go to a nearby restaurant. The location was good here, because it was just a short walk to the beach and many restaurants, however it was very close to the airport as well, which is both good and bad. Good because it doesn't take long to get to the hotel, but bad because there are always planes passing by so it's quite noisy. I would recommend this hotel if you need somewhere to stay for a short amount of time before a cruise, or if you don't plan to do much on your vacation. Review #35:Stayed here in March, 2006 The Good: Overall it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice hotel, although its far from a new property. The breakfast ins included and they do a nice job- choice of coffees and tea, fruit, a hot item, cereals, yogurt etc. The business center is a nice plus and offers free printing. The pool is on the small side- but never looked crowded. The people are friendly The not so good: The hotel has suites and standard rooms- I was in a standard room. The furniture is newer, but the rooms themselves are kind of beat up ( some mildew on the over calked bath tub, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd material coming from the piper in the tub, etc.). The hotel is very close to the airport and if you have the windows open you feel like you are sleeping on a run way. As with most Hamptons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this location offers no room service or restaurant- there is however a snack area at the pool- but it closes fairly early. Summary- stay there if the price is right but compare the Marriott Price and Availability first Review #36:I've stayed at dozens of properties throughout the Hilton family, ranging from high-end Waldorf Astoria properties in New York or the Conrad in the Maldives, to not-so-stellar places such as airport Hampton Inns. Because this property was so close to San Juan airport, I was assuming it'd be like your typical airport budget hotel...but was surprised and delighted to see it was not. This property is great --good location, great staff, and nice interiors/rooms --definitely the best Hampton Inn I've stayed at.... and generally nicer than more than 70% of Hilton Hotels I've stayed at. The lobby featured new/modern decor...as did the room. The bed/furnishings were high quality....and the materials in the bathroom (granites and beautiful tile) were too. The room was quiet and very clean --I remarked at how \"fresh\" the room smelled when I first walked in. They provided the typical Hampton Inn breakfast, which included fruits, cereals, carbs, and some hot options which included cheese omelets, bacon, and make-your-own waffles. There was plenty of self-dispensed juice to drink too in addition to coffee. You can eat at table seating, bartop seating, or outdoors by the pool. The pool was nice --large and clean, and featured a swim-up bar to a bar/grill in the rear of the property. The food at the pool bar/grill was top-notch; I was shocked I was eating in a Hampton Inn and shocked I was eating at a pool bar/grill with the type of quality I was enjoying. Bar/grill staff were very friendly. Front desk staff was cheery and helpful. There was an error on my folio at check-out that they promptly fixed. The location is good; a short 2-3 minute walk across the street brings you to the Ritz Carlton, other nearby casinos, or the beach. I felt safe in and around the hotel. Overall, a great stay in a great property with great service. So much so the hotel should bear a more upscale brand than \"Hampton Inn.\" Review #37:I travel to PR several times a year and always stay at the Hampton Inn in Isla Verde. I always have a wonderful experience - the staff are very friendly and helpful (will always point you to a great restaurant or book a local tour), the rooms are large and clean, and the location is excellent. You have a short walk to the beach, a ton of restaurants, and bars. There are several other large hotels nearby (on the beach) that are extremely overpriced and stuffy. I have stayed in a variety of these hotels as well and always have a poor experience. I highly recommend the Hampton Inn! Review #38:The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The whole hotel is clean and pleasant to be in. Parking is an extra $5 a day but that us fair compared to other locations in the area. Breakfast is included but if your kids like cereal ask for it. For those who keep kosher, Chabad is a five minute walk from the hotel. Review #39:Just returned from a quick trip to PR with mom to celebrate her 60th. Love the place and the people. We took a jr. suite facing the pool. We had 2 double cloud 9 beds and a large tv in the bedroom. A nice kitchen area with sink, coffee maker, microwave, and mini frig. We also had a living room with couch, chair, desk/table with 2 side chairs and a large tv. All was clean and very nice. Continental breakfasts w/ 2 hot items (eggs/sausage) were provided until 10 am and coffee/tea provided 24 hours. The breakfast made it easy to get our day started without figuring anything out. Pool and jacuzzi are nice with fluffy towels provided. Staff is friendly - recommending buses, restaurants and even having a few menus on hand. Location is very convenient to the airport and you can walk to the beach in a few minutes (ask staff where best beach is since access is limited due to private bldgs and homes). If you take public bus route A5 into Old San Jan as we did expect at least a 1/2 hour ride with a close up experience to PR and its wonderful and warm people. Great restaurant deli across the street - I know it looks like a diner but it is good. Metropol on the other side of the cockfighting arena next door had wonderful cuban fare and drums located in the Isle Verdre mall (2 o'clock from the Hampton front door) had a wonderful red snapper special as well as PR appetizers. Review #40:This hotel - I think - is supposed to be a business hotel. As a business hotel, it's got some very nice features: 2 minutes from the airport, decent internet bandwidth, a nice business center with 4 HP towers and a laser printer, quick dry-cleaning, in-house coin laundry, quick in-and-out parking, and very close to restaurants. However, the hotel is 2 blocks from the beach. As a result, the clientele is a bit skeevy. Small children in wet bathing suits running wild in the hallways, screaming to all hours. Teen baseball teams creating long lines, noise, and chaos at breakfast. To me, businessmen and vacationers do not make a good mix. But the hotel staff were perfectly bi-lingual (surprisingly rare in Puerto Rico), very cordial and helpful, and I would have to say overall my experience at this hotel was a good one. I think next time I will stay at the Doubletree, which is not near the beach and seems a bit more business-oriented. Review #41:I recently spent 30 days at this hotel. The staff was very accomodating to every need a long term client can have. Great rooms with essentials to survive away from home. Did not use most of the facilities but they all looked clean and inviting. Highly recommended and it is now part of the Hilton family for those of us that like to get points for our stays. Review #42:We had never been to the Isla Verde area but decided to stay there overnight so we would be close to the airport for an early morning flight. We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel's location which was within walking distance to upscale restaurants and casinos. The area felt very safe also. The hotel was very clean, staff very helpful and we chose a King suite overlooking the pool which was fantastic. We did not get a chance to use the pool but it looked very nice. They had a manager's reception in the early evening with drinks and opportunities to talk to the other guests and staff - very nice touch. The breakfast was good and as an added bonus we were at the airport within 15 minutes. Review #43:The staff is great. The rooms are clean and well kept. The breakfast is excellent. The swim up bar and grill is pretty awesome too! If you don't want to pay Old San Juan prices, but want to be close to all the activities this is a great option. The Isla Verde area is great! You are only a 5 minute walk to the beach, a 10 minute drive to the airport, and a 15 minute drive to Old San Juan, plus there are tons or shops and restaurants just a few steps from the hotel. We will certainly be back! Review #44:My wife and I stayed here for one night prior to boarding a cruise. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms spacious and well appointed, and there was plenty to keep us busy on site/nearby (pool, fitness center, beach nearby, plenty of restaurants within walking distance, casinos, shopping, etc). Pool and hot tub were both well maintained and there was a swim-up bar that served drinks and food. The free hot breakfast in the morning was stocked with everything you could imagine for breakfast. Free WiFi too. Only two negatives and both were minor. First, it was right next to the airport and so the noise of planes taking off during the day was a bit distracting. Also, we had no HOT water (lukewarm only) in the morning for showers. Review #45:I am a Hilton HHonors Diamond Member with more than 100 stays per year at the Hilton Hotels, this hotel was the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at, the place seemed like it was from the 1960's, the beds were horrible, the staff's attitude was very conflictive, this hotel should be priced at around $59 per night and not at $189. What a disgrace to Conrad Hilton; the pool, the carpet, the paint, the beds; were all dilapidated. My family and I decided that after a few days, it was time to move on, at which point we advised the hotel and they were insulting by saying \"Well, guess its time to go home, because Puerto Rico is expensive,\" and I responded with \"NO, we are moving to a real hotel, like the Embassy Suites; once we arrived at the Embassy Suites, the hotel manager personally took care of us and gave us the Diamond Member treatment. For a difference of only $20, our family was able to recuperate from the dreadful mistake of staying at the \"Worst Hampton in All of the America's.\" This hotel is probably ok for the flying crew; as they are only in for a night, but not for families. My kids had a wonderful time at the Embassy Suites with a Cascading Waterfall and water toys to pass several hours; also the breakfast and food was far superior to anything served at the Hampton. At the Hampton, the cafeteria or area serving food, closed at around 9p.m., what a disappointment. No more stays at Hampton Inns, neither in Puerto Rico nor anywhere else. Review #46:I chose this hotel because of the location - close to the airport and the beach area. We stayed after our cruise and really lucked out with this place. It was very clean, had friendly and helpful staff, and a great hot breakfast! The pool patio was very clean and inviting, with a hot tub and bar in the same area. Our room was large with two comfortable queen size beds, and the bathroom was also very large and clean. They also provide free internet from either your room or the computer room off the foyer. They are close to a number of restaurants and bars for either local cuisine or your standard North American chains. We two women felt quite safe walking around outside (however, I wouldn't venture down to the beach at night), with many police patrols visible. It's only a $20 taxi ride to downtown Old San Juan. Highly recommended! ! Review #47:We stayed here after our first hotel overbooked and sent us to a dump we refused to stay in- I called this hotel and asked if they had any availability. They had one room to offer and we snatched it up to get out of where we were. We only stayed one night but would stay again. Nice area, comfortable to walk around in at night- rooms were nice, breakfast was good. We didn't spend a lot of time here (late arrival and left San Juan the next morning for Luquillo) but it was a nice hotel. Review #48:We visited this hotel on May 9, 2009. We stayed there because we were taking the Royal Carribean cruise which left the next day. This hotel was beautiful!! It is very clean and the complimentary breakfast was excellent. The staff was very professional and helpful to us. We were very pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #49:I've stayed at the Hampton several times over the years on business, as well as some of the fancy hotels nearby on Isla Verde. For a clean and nice place to sleep, as well as a friendly staff, cheap parking and free internet this is the only place in the San Juan metro area that I can recommend. Sure other places are right on the beach, have a fancy pool with $7 cokes and bottles of water, so leave that to the tourists. Lots of flight crews stay here, as well as people coming in early or staying an extra day after a cruise or caribbean vacation while waiting on a flight at the airport (literally right behind the hotel). The staff is extremely friendly and the entire property is very clean, which is a luxury in and of itself in PR. If you are looking for the fancy hotel lobbys, restaurants and expensive restaurants they are all within a 5 minute (or less) walk from the front door. The beach is also 2 blocks away. Just take the side street next to the Walgreens and it drops you right on the same strech of sand used by the Ritz Carlton. This is one of the best Hampton Inns in North America. I'll be back. Review #50:My coworker/friend met me at this hotel to finish the last leg of my solo vacation so I was anxious to have some company. My coworker is a younger person who has limited finances so I was hoping that everything was up to par so that she can enjoy her vacation. We were not disappointed with this hotel. The location was very close to the airport, taxi to the hotel was $12. The hotel staff are very nice and helpful. The hotel, room and grounds are very clean and comfortable. Not on the beach but close enough. Free breakfast was acceptable and satisfying to start the day. Plenty of food places close by. I arrived at 9am and was immediately checked in - no waiting till 3pm. I sure didn't want to haul my luggage around until 3pm. The beds are comfortable and the pillows the best. Free wi-fi either in the hotel or your room Review #51:I was in San Juan for a week for business so I wasn't going to be spending a lot of time at the hotel. I just wanted a clean, comfortable room in a convenient location. The Hampton Inn was perfect. There's plenty of parking which was a big plus and for only $5 a day. The room has a nice big flat screen tv and a refrigerator which is nice as I like to keep cold water and some beer in the room. The desk staff was very helpful in recommending places to eat. The pool area is very nice and very clean. There is a swim-up bar and grill which has very good food. If I go back to Puerto Rico for busniness I'll definitely stay here again. Review #52:It's no 5 star resort if that's what you are looking for. It's intended purpose is that of a typical airport inn and you will find several pilots, flight attendants, and business people staying there. However, it was quite inpressive for the money. The prices are low and for that price the rooms are comfortable, clean and updated, the lobby is nice, nice pool, great location, and friendly staff. My 2 friends and I stayed there for a vacation trip and were very happy. It's a short walk to the beach, restaurants, bars, clubs and casino's. I would stay there again if returning to San Juan. Review #53:Would highly recommend this hotel. We stayed the last night our vacation to be near the airport. The rooms are wonderful, beds are very comfortable, pool area is great. The price was reasonable and the complimentary breakfast is very good. There are restaurants across the street. We only heard the airplanes when we were outside. Review #54:I stayed at the Hampton with my wife, my son and his wife the night before our cruise left port. Other than the double beds being a bit cozy, we had a good stay here. The breakfast in the morning was good and the front desk personel were very friendly and helpful. Review #55:We came in a couple days before a cruise and stayed here. Someone in our group had been there before and recommended it. The rooms were nice and our stay there was pleasant. There was free breakfast in the morning that was very sufficient. One night a neighboring room was having a fight in the middle of the night. We called security and it was taken care of very quickly. There is a Walgreen's within walking distance if you need to buy a few last minute items before cruising. Review #56:I recently stayed here with friends for a bachelorette party. THE GOOD: Rooms are clean, the hotel staff was nice (talk to Omar at the front desk). THE BAD: It is not a beachfront property, so you have to walk 2 blocks to the beach (not bad). The beach within walking distance is dirty (cigerette butts everywhere). I recommend researching where the cleaner beaches are on the island. Additionally, go early for breakfast (they stop replenshing the hot breakfast after 9). THE UGLY: The pool is absolutely disgusting. You cannot even see the bottom on the 3 foot side. There are things floating in there, that make you want to vomit. OTHER TIPS: Cabs are very expensive, so rent a car. You can rent one at the Ritz down the street. Go to El San Juan Hotel & Casino to party / drinks. Their lobby is very lively. Lupi's is the only 24/7 eatery around, its not good, but if you gotta eat, you gotta eat! Definitely go to Old San Juan - the restaurant \"Mira Buena\" is delicious! And also, for authentic local PR food, go check out the food Kiosks on the east tip of the island (30 min drive). I recommend Kiosk #38. Review #57:We stayed the last night of our vacation here. It was very clean and comfortable. A breakfast is included in your rate (cheese omelet ,sausage,bagels,cereal,yogurt,etc.). There was some airport noise due to how close the hotel is to it. Only a 5 min taxi ride away . Also, a 5 min walk to the Isla Verde beach. I would recommend this hotel. Review #58:Second time in 12 months at this hotel and another outstanding stay. Obviously many people want an \"on the beach\" resort, but if you are willing to walk across the street, your savings and satisfaction will be met here! Inexpensive parking, the most friendly front desk staff available, a fantastic poolside grill, clean rooms, linens and comfy beds. This is a fantastic hotel. Breakfast is unbeatable and they change it up daily. The pool grill has fantastic food at a very affordable price for families. Your walk across the street can take you to the Pine Grove area of Isla Verde....go right toward the Ritz resort or the western side near the El San Juan - you must try both sides.......so fun! We can't say enough positive about the Hampton and it's staff. Review #59:This hotel was perfect for what we needed for a pre-cruise stay of one night. After a very long day including 2 flights and lost luggage we were beat. The hotel is close to the airport, there is a pharmacy across the street and a great pool area. It was clean and safe and staff was friendly. The little grill by the pool was awesome and the burgers were delicious. We expected very limited choices but their menu was a lot broader than we expected, including chicken and even, I think, steak. Breakfast was larger than your usual continental type and more than what we needed. We would stay here again. Review #60:The best feature of this hotel is the pool and the breakfast. The pool has a swim up bar but was rarely seen being used during our 10 day stay. The pool area is clean but the lounge chair cushons could be taken better care. The hot breakfast was nice but could offer a few options. The fresh waffles that were offered daily were a nice addition. The fruit was quite sour and the eggs were a bit dry but can't complain too much as there is a larger variety than what Ive had at other hotels. The rooms were clean and housekeeping was there first thing in the morning. The staff was very courteous and professional. I would stay here again. Review #61:Very nice hotel, breakfast buffet included and only $5/day parking. Close to Pueblo supermarket, airport and various restaurants. Good service by the front desk: when I had a problem with the wifi internet, they brought me a regular wired modem. Can be busy at weekends: there was a very long queue at the front desk to check out when we were checking in early. Review #62:Before we were ready to take off on first cruise, we stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites in Isla Verde. It is well located, being about 15 minutes from the airport and in walking distance to key places in Isla Verde. The front desk staff was very friendly from the first point we arrived. I liked how they had free drinks all day. The interior of the property was nice, but the room was worn around the edges. It was obvious that the lobby and other areas of the hotel were refurbished while the rooms were a bit neglected. However, the room was spacious, and the beds were comfortable. We had a nice view of pool. The free breakfast was a plus and helped to save time since we had a tour of El Yunque rainforest the next morning. On our first day, I really wanted to try the infamous El Churry sandwich, which has three types of meats served from a food truck on Isla Verde street where we where staying. It was a long walk from the hotel through rain and way at the other end. Sadly, when we got there around 4 p.m., the truck was closed. However, that night we walked across the street to another Hilton property, El San Juan Resort & Casino, and caught a free concert featuring the Gypsy Kings. Overall, it was a nice stay at the Hampton Inn and in Puerto Rico. Review #63:Stayed here for a night while connecting flights. Friendly, nice pool where we hung out with the kids, breakfast was good, good pool food at the grill, took the family suite which was perfect for us (we're four). Convenient to get to the airport. Supermarket nearby (walking distance). Old San Juan is lovely to visit. Recommend Review #64:Went to the Heineken Jazz Fest and choose to stay here for the good price. Hotel is in a excellent location with Denny's and a CVS across the street. The food from the pool bar was grilled and great. The only complaint I have was that the maid came early in the morning twice and opened the door with a fast knock while we were sleeping. The 2nd time she came back I told her to come back in a half hour. When I left the room all of the clean ladies where in the hallway still working and said hi to us. When we came back to the room 4 hours later the room wasn't cleaned. We had to call the front desk for soap and clean towels. The next day was our check out day and the maid still came knocking on the door early in the morning. Other than that the staff was very friendly! The room we had (453) had water stains on the wall by the door from an apparent leak from the ceiling, but it didn't effect our stay at all. Review #65:We stayed at Hampton Inn for one night pre-cruise. After arriving on a \"red eye\" from the west coast, we were fairly tired and ready to relax a bit. Even though it was only 11AM, the hotel staff was kind enough to allow us to check in early and gave us our keys right away. The hotel was clean and while this is no \"resort\", it has everything you could need for a short stay of 1 or 2 nights. The pool is small but nice and even has a swim up bar at one end. The bar cooks burgers, hot dogs and few other local items. It's a great little area just just relax and enjoy the tropics after a long flight. The rooms are fairly well kept and the bedding was clean. Even though it's located pretty close to the airport, noise was not a factor while inside. While at the pool, the planes could still be heard, but it's a momentary distraction at best. The hotel has a couple of other nice features like a business center that had 5 computers (great for emailing friends/family and gloating that you have arrived in the Caribbean) and also a self-serve breakfast in the morning. Breakfast alone probably saved the three of us $40. While the hotel is not located very close to Old San Juan (about 15 minutes away), taxi service was easily available. Also, since Hampton is close to the airport, the taxi from the airport was not overly expensive. There are plenty of restaurants and casinos nearby. Our only wish would be that the hotel had an airport shuttle. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and it's perfect for pre or post cruise nights. Hampton Inn is a good choice for keeping your budget in check, but still getting a few perks. Review #66:Having stayed at this hotel a few years back and having a positive experience, we booked a pre-cruise overnight for this trip. Again, we were not disappointed. The hotel is clean, has a nice pool with a swim-up bar, free wi-fi, and a great complimentary breakfast. It is within walking distance of the beach, casinos, restaraunts, and various stores. It is about 5 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from the cruise port. Review #67:This is a very good hotel and an incredible value. Traveling with hungry teens, the breakfast bar was great for stretching our meal budget. We stayed in a two room suite which was great for a week long stay, so we would not tripping over one another. The beds were incredible... crisp and clean with two choices of pillows (soft & firm). The overall hotel (both interior and exterior)was nicely decorated and the pool area was lovely (especially at night). The hamburgers at the poolside grill were delicious ( a big hit with my teens) and convenient. The hotel is within walking distance of the beach, a Walgreens, a city bus stop, and literally dozens of resturants. We ate at several of the local ones, and never had a bad meal. Only a few details kept this hotel from getting a perfect mark...First, we had water leak from the room above us (in the shower) but someone came up right away to address it and clean up, but it was still a small annoyance and the plumbing needs to be addressed before it becomes a regular occurance....they could stand to vaccum the hallways/rooms and pool a little more often, and they should paint the interior room doors (they were off-white) and refinish the bathtubs. As these areas need some attention, overall though this is a solid establishment. Review #68:My husband and I just arrived home after a wonderful week at the Hampton Inn & Suites in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This hotel is absolutely the best we have stayed at. Its very cozy and has a home feeling. The customer service staff is the greatest! We miss it already and if you're looking for a nice place to stay, please try the Hampton Inn. Thank you to all the ladies in customer service. They are the best! Review #69:We stayed for one night pre-cruise and used points to pay for the room so the price was right. Otherwise it would have run us about $250 for the night. The front desk staff was very helpful, the room was nice and clean and there were many places to walk out for dinner. The pool area is attractive - decent sized pool, small hot tub, comfy loungers and a good bar/grill (I also agree the hamburger is excellent). You do hear noise from the airport when the planes take off (rendering conversation impossible for 30 seconds at a time), but it's no big deal. Review #70:This was our third stay at the Hampton Inn this year and my second review. I had to take one star off of the previous review due to a backslide in the housekeeping department. Upon first checking in for this stay we were assigned a room upstairs. The room looked like it had been cleaned and made up properly but upon inspection, I noticed that one of the beds had small black hairs all over it. I went downstairs and they immediately assigned me another room, this one being on the first floor. All was well the first night but again the housekeeping showed signs of weakness. Two of the four nights we were there we did not receive any washcloths. One of the nights our clean bath towels were draped over the toilet tank instead of on the rack...disgusting. It was also obvious that our sheets were never changed for our four night stay. I find that unacceptable as well. We leave tips every day and are very tidy in our room because we do not like to be a burden on the staff but this was obviously not appreciated. Other than those issues, the hotel is still a good bet. They are under renovation right now but travelers are not inconvenienced by it at all. I believe the renovation is supposed to be completed by the end of November. The free breakfast has been moved from the lobby to a conference room down the hall. Parking is still a bargain at $5 a day. (Other hotels charge between $15 - $20.) The Wifi signal also seemed stronger than on my previous visit in June. I did not have any trouble connecting with my mobile device. This hotel is frequented by many business travelers and airline staff as well. It is not a resort but a solid hotel in the Isla Verde area. I hope they address the housekeeping issues. Review #71:I would like to inform you of our recent stay at the Hampton Inn Suites Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I reserved 3 suites. We had one suite reserved for 5-28-10 the suite was ready and my sister could immediately check in. We had a connecting suite for 5-29-10. When my wife and I arrived we learned that one of our suites were accidentally booked the prior day. We spoke with the Manager, who apologized for the mishap and advised that she would do her best to accommodate us. Not only did she do her best she went above and beyond and we just wanted to let everyone know that we had a wonderful time at the hotel, we were very satisfied with the rooms, the staff was great, the free breakfast was an added treat, the food at pool side was fantastic. We look forward to our vacation there next year. I am so glad my wife booked reservations at this hotel. A few of our family and friends stayed at some of the pricier hotels and they informed us that the service was not that great. Again, I would like to thank the staff at the Hampton Inn & Suites for their exceptional hospitality. Review #72:We came into Peurto Rico late and had previously booked another hotel. The hotel we had chosen was not going to work so we called a travel agent and she booked us at the Hampton. The first three nights our air was not working and we had someone come and fix it however it did not work. The phone in our room was also out of order. They had attempted to fix it but that did not work. We had a wedding to attend and we called again about the air and someone from the front desk came up to see that it was very warm and went ahead and switched us to a new room. We were late to our wedding due to switching rooms 2 hours prior to the wedding. The pool was a beautiful place to be. The airplanes were loud but tollerable. However people were constantly having to ask for towels. The bar by the pool had wonderful burgers available all day. On our third day the bar ran out of Corona, Nanchos, limes, and Medalla. This to me was frusturating. Some people go on vacation to sight see and others go to lay pool side and soak up the sun and just be free of a schedule and with these luxuries missing that is not easliy accomplished. The hotel was a very nice place to stay and I would recommend it. I feel that they really need to be more orgainized and on top of things after all you are not spending $1900.00 for two beds and a nice shower. We were compt one night and a rollaway bed. To me that is just not right when they clearly say Hampton Inn 100% Gurantee. Review #73:We stayed here prior to a cruise as we had last year.Following our earlier stay I gave a generally positive review of this hotel (on February 13, 2006) except for the malfunctioning air conditioning unit for which we were given a suitable adjustment (we were compted). No such problem this time as every thing was fine, No airport noise in the room, the pool was great, the area has a lot to offer as far as restaurants etc. This is not a fancy hotel , but a Hampton INN and one of the better ones at that. One criticism I have is the price of ALL of the hotels in San Juan which have been creeping upward in each of the past 5 years I have been visiting San Juan. I believe an AARP rate of $200 is too expensive for this hotel just as the $300-$500 rates are too expensive for the fancier hotels nereby that were in the $200 plus range only a few years ago.. Review #74:Before I even begin to review this hotel, I have to commend the staff at this hotel. Let's be honest, we all well know that Hampton Inns are in the lower spectrum of the Hilton chain. That is no secret, and this hotel does not deviate from the obvious. So, what separates one chain from another is its staff and the little things that people do to make your stay memorable, comfortable and in this case (with hurricane Irene in tow) bearable. With more than a million people in Puerto Rico without electricity and some even without water, the Hampton Inn in San Juan, kept its composure and more importantly, electricity, water, food, entertainment and surprisingly enough, internet service as well. People were fed, attended to and serviced with a smile. Rooms were clean and everything in my room was in perfect order. Remember that the people who work at the hotel are residents of the island and them too, had no power or water. They showed up and displayed their best. The hotel offered a very nice breakfast, had DVD movies showing at the lobby and kept the small but adequate fitness room operating so that people would have a choice and avoid \"cabin fever\". The hotel is relatively a short walk to the beach which normally I would had checked out. I hope this comment gets to everyone at the hotel and most importantly, to the powers to be and recognize these wonderful people that pulled it together in the face of adversity. Review #75:We stayed here for 2 nights after a trip to Culebra before flying back to Florida. We found the hotel to be very helpful, allowing us to check in early and giving various directions when needed. The room was spotlessly clean and we paid $127 a night. We got a ground floor room which had TV with cable(BBC World News was nice for us Brits), huge bed, free WI FI, coffee maker but no fridge or microwave. The breakfast was very good and there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance. There's a bus stop opposite the hotel where 75 cents gets you to old San Juan and the beach is a 5 minute walk away. Overall, very nice with no problems encountered. Review #76:We stayed at the Hampton Inn on Isla Verde for 7 nights. The suite was a little smaller than Hampton Inns we've stayed at in the states, but they provided us with two cribs for our baby and toddler and everyone fit fine. The pool was great, we couldve spent our whole vacation there, and only crossed the street to go to the beach once. There is a lot of shopping in walking distance for the needs of a family- Walgreens, grocery stores. The free breakfast at the hotel was wonderful, the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms clean. The nearby airport was very loud though, and the hotel is located on a very busy street. Review #77:After reading many good reviews, we used Honors points for a free night before a flight back to Texas. This was the best decision we could have made. The front desk staff were all wonderful. When we checked in, we asked for a room with 2 beds rather than one. Not only were we given this change, but we were also upgraded to a suite. The room was immaculate and had every ammenity anyone could want. We used our room towels for the pool & upon heading back to our room, we asked for more towels. The towels arrived immediately after we got to our room. The pool was nice as was the pool swim up bar. We decided to go to Metrapol for dinner (good choice) but we were told by 3 other guests that the hamburgers were the best they had ever had....no exceptions. One guest said that he had been there 3 days and had eaten hamburgers at the pool bar 4 times! We heard a plane when we were in the pool. It did require that we stop our conversation for about 15 to 20 seconds. We did not consider this a major inconvenience. We never heard anything when we were in our room. Review #78:Stayed at the Hampton Inn one night pre-boarding Royal Caribbean. Quick $10 cab ride (+ $1/bag) to hotel. Then $19 cab ride to Pan American pier. Dropped our bags off at ship and took another cab to Old San Juan for $15. Wish we had more time in San Juan to visit more attractions. Cabs are zoned and accessible Review #79:My boyfriend and I booked the Hampton Inn for 2 nights pre-cruise. We were very happy with this hotel. The price was much cheaper than most other hotels in the area. Though the area is expensive as a whole. The hotel was clean, the bed was very comfortable, the breakfast was better than adequate, the pool bar area & grill were very nice also. The burgers are huge and juicy. We walked about a block or 2 to Isla Verde beach which was very nice. We also took the bus into Old San Juan. You catch it out front for .75 cents. I would not suggest it. Pay the extra money and take the cab. The bus was packed wall to wall people and the driver had people flying all over the place because he drove crazy. It also took triple the time as the cab ride home. We waited at least 30-40 minutes for the bus to pick us up also and the locals told us that is the norm because the drivers get paid either way so have no incentive to be on time. We did not have any problems with air conditioning in our room. Ours worked very well. It was freezing in the room. We also had no problems getting pool towels. They had an area at the pool whee u get get towels/dispose of towels. The grill outside does run out of things (certain beer,etc) but we just chose something else then. All in all we had a very good time here and would stay at the Hampton Inn again. Review #80:The location of this hotel is very good (assuming you have a car) and parking is $5.00/night which is very good. However, the rooms are worn down and not very clean. The sheets look old and with stains. It has a free breakfast, but it is clearly food that is tailored to the American tourist (e.g. Bagel with cheese/bacon/pizza souce on top, Muffins, etc... (thought it had fruits, which was good). In general, this hotel it's simply too expensive for what it is. Review #81:I have stayed at many Hilton-owned San Juan Hotels and I was so pleased to find that this Hilton run Hampton Inn has the same high Hilton standards. Wonderful staff, clean rooms, plentiful breakfast and most of all, a really nice crowd of people! I love that this is a non-Casino hotel, but there are many casino's nearby if that's your thing. I found it easy to take the bus to/from Old San Juan from here and it's literally across the street from the beach but their pool was a quiet beautiful spot. I will definitely return!!! Book a room here without hesitation, you'll be pleased! Thank you Front Desk, Bell staff, Housekeeping and Breakfast staff --you are really doing a great job!! ! Review #82:I stayed here several times. It is far the best hotel in the Isla Verde area. The airport is right behind the hotel. The only blemish. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is really good. I will absouletly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the San Juan Review #83:Would definitely stay here again. Great linens and bed! You can eat your complimentary (nice, large selection of items) breakfast outside by the pool if you like. Fairly expensive, but all the hotels are. A selection of restaurants within a few blocks that you can walk to. Good beach also within walking distance. You can walk to a bustop that will take you to Old San Juan (about 45 minutes) for $.75 exact change. Taxi to airport was about $16.00+ - seem to have a standard rate, same each way. Review #84:We were able to get a great rate on a king suite back in November. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The room had two HDTVs and separate sleeping and living/dining areas. Parking was free since the gate was malfunctioning. Breakfast was okay, but was for gringos. Our only real incident was that or toilet got backed up one afternoon, but maintenance and housekeeping dealt with it right away. Review #85:The staff at the hotel was great! Anytime we needed directions or suggestions they were happy to help. The room was clean and updated, more then we expected. The breakfast every morning was definitly a plus. Safe and fun. Will definitly stay agian. Review #86:Our room had a water leak and they moved us down the hall.The breakfast was OK but on the way back to room, a large roach crossed in front of me.The location was good but it rained and the water flooded the exit of parking lot.Pool was very small,no hot tub. Review #87:This is a nice hotel and is currently undergoing some renovation/improvements (as of 10/2011) so it should be even nicer, BUT that won't change the fact that this hotel is in a strange, cramped, and less than \"resort like\" neighborhood. Right next to a cock fighting arena, it is difficult to see unless you know exactly what you are looking for. I had gone to the Hampton website numerous times before our trip, but when driving in the neighborhood of the hotel I missed it twice while driving right past it. The hotel does not offer a shuttle so you will pay $10 for a taxi from the airport. The breakfast was great. The pool is nice but VERY busy. Review #88:Visited San Juan this past weekend and I must say that this hotel is awesome. It was very clean, affordable, attractive and the staff was professional. Room was nicely decorated, always filled with fresh towels and linen. The bed was sooooo comfy!!! The pool bar is the best. The price of food and drinks at the poolside bar is definetely affordable and great. (Try the grilled chicken breast and the prime ribs). The computer lab is clean, nice and free with internet. The staff was always attentive to every need, friendly and professional. It is centrally convienient to restarants, walgreens, a supermarket, casino's and most all 2 blocks away from the beach!!!! The breakfast was not the greatest, but was ok. Consider Dennys for breakfast which is located across the street on the second day of your stay or wait until lunch time and get food at the pool bar... The only thing i would recommend is The walls in the bedrooms just need a lil touch up with painting. Improve the breakfast choices. Review #89:Recently stayed here for a week, and had a very good time. We arrived early in the morning, and they were very accommodating, letting us check in early. We had a suite with a king bed, and it was very comfortable, had very good sleeps. Every time we went down to the front desk to ask about a restaurant or something, they were very helpful and sure to make sure we had everything we needed.The continental breakfast was good too. Overall we had an excellent stay! ! Review #90:We stayed at this Hotel after we came back from our cruise and this place was very nice. When we got there the rooms were not ready (2 rooms) but it wasn't a very long wait for our rooms. While we waited they stored our luggage for us and told us we could use all the facilities, pool etc. It has a beautiful pool area with a swim up pool bar & grill you can eat at. The prices were a bit high but the food was good. The rooms were nice, clean and fresh. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This Hotel is across the street from the beach but you just have to walk across the street to the beach and it is handy to the airport, just a few minutes away. There is a Walgreens across the street and just up the street of course is Chili's. Very good place to eat. The Hampton has a continental breakfast but we didn't get a chance to try it because our flight left early in the morning. All in all this was a nice place and I would definitly stay there again. Wish we had booked here before the cruise instead of the ESJ. Review #91:I stayed at the Hampton inn for 7 nights & I loved it! It was nice, quite, & relaxing. The hotel was VERY clean & the rooms were huge. The hotel is positioned in a good spot on the strip so you can walk to different local places. As for the airport noise, you only hear it by the pool & not in your room..BUT you will hear that same noise at any other hotel on that same strip! Trust me, I went visited other hotels. Bottom line, stay here! The food is good, the staff are nice & accomadating, & it's a lovely place. I will stay there again. Review #92:Stay at the Hampton Inn for 4 days and 3 nights. My husband and I went to PR for his 30th birthday. Arrived at the airport 1 hour before the Hotel staff kindly allowed us to check-in early. The Hotel is modern and I think the the atomosphere is very relaxing. The hallway on the floor that we stayed on was never loud it was quiet. Breakfast was excellent and the staff their made sure your needs were met at breakfast time. The pool and hot tub are clean and fun. Towel were provided in the pool area. The beach is a short walk away. DO NOT get a rental car because everything is nearby. The bus is safe and it cost $0.75 to get to Old San Juan and $0.75 back. Very cheap compared to $20 the taxi cost one way. The Casino was modest size and I got luck while there. The night club with the EL San Juan Hotel and Casino is upscale and very nice $20 to get in. Prefect location everything is withing walking distance. Will only stay at this Hampton Inn Next time I travel. Review #93:On arrival, we were warmly welcomed by Naomi at the Front Desk, who was very attentive and helpful. She quickly browsed the system and offered us two options for accommodation and gave a summary of an excellent special that was currently on for the King room which had a sitting area as well. Excellent upsell because the room was very spacious and clean for just an additional US$10. Naomi knew her stuff - in both English and Spanish! The facilities were very well kept and the Housekeeping was outstanding. The room was ready right away, which is always a plus. The complimentary breakfast was good and other bonuses like newspapers were readily available. It would be an excellent choice for business travellers, but is equally suitable for couples and families. Excellent surroundings, helpful and well-informed team members and good location make this hotel an excellent choice in Puerto Rico. Review #94:Three friends & myself stayed for 1 comfortable night prior to our Princess Cruise. The staff were very friendly & helpful. The location is excellent . Across the road is a pharmacy , grocery shop & a couple of blocks away is the beach although the pool was just fine. We enjoyed a typical Puerto Rican & reasonably priced meal restaurant in a strip mall across from the extremely expensive Intercontinental Hotel . Then we went next door to our restaurant for Ice Cream. The queen beds were definitely comfortable & we slept well . Review #95:Hotel stay was good till a storm came which knocked out the cable and forced me, my wife and 7 month old son to stay in the room and do nothing, not even internet, they say high speed online but your better off not even using it. Was forced to go to the hotel up the street were family was staying (by the way they had no problems during the 3 day storm, cough cough Embassy Suits), so we could actually keep track of the wether (found out a tornado had passed threw). On the 3rd day (today) with no cable or \"internet\" I asked if we could be compensated at all, their answer was they have dvd's. I know no one wants a storm to pass through and mess things up, but come on are you really not going to compensate me paying $130 a night for half a room, take some money off at lease. But thats ok I'll be calling the higher ups in the morning. Review #96:My family stayed overnight before our cruise the next day. This hotel is bigger than the usual Hampton Inns we have here in mainland. The lobby is spacious. And the staff were smiling and willing to help. The room I chose was the suite since there were 3 of us. I was suprised when we entered as the room looked like that of the Embassy Suites. It was just refreshing. The casinos, Walgreens, and restaurants are just across the street. The neighborhood was safe to walk around 9 pm. It is very close to the airport. But there is no shuttle service. I like this hotel and I don't mind coming back. Review #97:I was really surprised. This is not your ordinary Hampton Inn. For instance, there's a big pool, with a pool side bar and grill (open to at least 21:00). They serve real drinks, and grill big burgers, skirt steaks, and prepare other full meals. The place seemed more like a small resort than a \"room only\" hotel. This Hampton is located on a good street, with lots of outside restaurants and bars, all within walking distance. It's close to the airport as well. I would be happy using this hotel for a longer stay. Review #98:We flew from Vieques to San Juan the day before our flight home to the US and stayed in the Hampton Inn while in San Juan. The hotel was great!! The room was clean and comfy, the breakfast and dining area was lovely and the pool was fantastic! Also having the pool bar and grill was a nice relaxing end to our vacation before an early flight home the next day. It is close to SJU airport so you do hear the planes when outside but not from the rooms. I slept great! Also is very close to everything so we walked to dinner and around downtown. Will absolutely stay here again. Review #99:Our family stayed here pre-cruise and post-cruise. It was quite convenient and close to the airport and port. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast had a lot of choices, as are Hampton Inn breakfasts. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and well maintained. The pool area is nice. I used the business center, has updated computers and free use of the printers which I used to print boarding passes. However, I was very disappointed with the rooms, they were not clean, dark and had a musty odor. The bathrooms were not clean as one would expect. We stayed in a suite and the wet bar area was very unclean. The tiles on the bathroom had mold. I felt disgusted while showering. Both times I stayed there, I felt the same way. The airplane noise was not a problem, could not hear it in the rooms. I was very disappointed with this Hampton Inn solely due to the accommodations, after all that is the most important part of the stay. I will not stay there again. If you are looking for a pre-cruise stay I suggest you stay in Old Town San Juan. The beach across the hotel and down a street was nothing to write home about.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Our previous stay at the Wedgewood - just prior to them being awarded a rating as a place to stay by Conde Naste - was tremendous. Unfortunately the hotel seems to have lost its star status- or at least that was our experience. The lobby and the room were needing some care and attention. Obviously the hotel has recognized this as the major problem we experienced was due to renovation. Construction and painting were going on in the room next to ours. A strong smell of paint persisted in our room throughout our four day stay - even over a weekend. When a complaint was made after the first night the staff sent up a machine intended to clean the air, we were told not to be in the room while it was on. We needed to keep the window open when we were in the room resulting in a cold stay. Vancouver was not warm in February. We were not provided with an option of moving rooms - despite this being a four day stay. In addition there was noise throughout the day so a little nap in the afternoon during the holiday was out of the question. Guests should be advised that construction is taking place prior to booking. The prices of the Wedgewood have risen over the years as the hotel has been discovered. Our experience in 2006 does not support the reputation that the hotel now enjoys. Perhaps the renovations will help to keep the hotel at the top but in the meantime guests should be informed that the construction may impact on their comfort and enjoyment. Review #1:My husband and I were sadly disappointed in this hotel, after I read rave reviews about how fantastic this hotel was and there is none like it in B.C. I planned this trip for our fifth year anniversary and wanted to be pampered. The spa was excellent, but I truly could not understand how this hotel could be rated above 3-star. We paid for a suite, which was over $350/US nightly, so, we expected five star service, food and accommodations. The service was lack luster, the room was very clean but definitely not fancy. The food, which for dinner we paid over $100 to eat in our room, not including drinks, was so-so. One great aspect which stood out in my mind, was the housekeeping supervisor. Our bed was awful so when we called the following day, she switched out our bed with the only pillow top in the hotel. We were thankful for her consideration, but decided to cut our trip short. We left two days earlier than scheduled and ended up spending our last two days at our favorite hotel, Bellevue Club in Bellevue, WA. We spent half the money we did in Bellevue and received two times the service, food quality and comfortable night stay. If you are used to four+ star hotels, you may want to continue looking before plunking down the four-star money here! Review #2:Comfy and quiet. The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. I think this is the first time I've been to a hotel and couldn't find ANYTHING to complain about. Everything worked! and everything was nice and clean. The complimentary chocolates and cookies were a very nice touch and a BIG bathtub for two, not in the bathroom, but IN the room itself. The hotel restaurant, Bacchus, had delicious food and good staff. Can't say enough good about this hotel. Review #3:The Wedgewood is our hotel of choice whenever we come to Vancouver. The location is great - a five minute walk (or less) to Pacific Centre, Robson street, the Art Gallery and great restaurants. It is a gem in a busy city - always a pleasure to return to after a busy day of shopping and sightseeing. The lounge is fantastic - intimate and urban, with really good food and drink. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean. Extra touches, such as free bottled water and cookies are appreciated. The service is consistently good at the Wedgewood. Mark, who checked us in on this last visit, was great - friendly and attentive. He recommended a great restaurant to us (Coast). We look forward to our next stay at this wonderful hotel. Review #4:My family stayed at the Wedgewood in June, on the way to and from an Alaskan cruise. The hotel was beautiful and charming, and we really enjoyed our stay. We had an adjoining room for the kids- they slept on the pull-out couch. We did request an extra cot since the kids are teenagers and didn't relish sharing a bed, but there were not any cots or roll-away beds. The kids especially loved the turn down service with the cookies. The location of the hotel is excellent, we were able to access many activities easily. We had one breakfast and one dinner at the hotel's restaurant. The food was very good, presented well and the price was expensive but fair. We thought the decor of the room was very nice, comfortable and inviting. The front desk staff was generally great- although there was one woman that was exceptionally helpful, going out of her way to help us with all of our requests (even one request of finding a store to get a broken watch repaired was fulfilled within minutes). There was another woman that worked at the front desk who was a bit aloof and stern, but was professional. We would definitely stay here again if we visit this beautiful city in the future. Review #5:After reading many of the reviews for this hotel and others in Vancouver we decided to stay at the Wedgewood. It seemed that hands down it received the best over all reviews. Years ago we had stayed at Sutton Place and really liked it, but the reviews lead us to believe that it was not as nice as it was in the late 80's and 90's. I had gone on line to look at the rooms at the Wedgewood and did think they looked a little \"tired\" but decided to stay there anyway because we like small hotels and booked a junior suite. Needless to say, we were very disappointed with the tired, outdated rooms and bathroom. There were no towel racks to hang the towels on in the small bathroom and the cheap oversized plastic waste paper basket was wedged between the toilet and the toilet paper holder. The tv in the bedroom was situated high in the corner of the bedroom on the type of platform you would find in a hospital room. And the room safe was from another era altogether. Also when we were checking out of our room we dediced not to call the bellman as our two bags were on wheels. However we forgot that there are stairs leading down to reception from the eleavators (why they don't have a ramp, especially for a handicap person, makes no sense) and as we were going down the stairs (with a bellman just standing there) my husband's bag ended up falling down the stairs, breaking the handle. The hotel was clean and the bed comfortable, and I think that with a major renovation this could be a lovely hotel, but I know I will not stay there again in it's present condition. Review #6:We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Wedgewood. The staff were extremely friendly, courteous and professional - nothing was too much trouble. Our room was fabulous - wonderful big bed, amazing bath, and a lovely balcony with great views out over the city. A highlight was an amazing English Afternoon tea which was better than any I've had at the Ritz in London. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Vancouver. Review #7:Our room was beautiful and the housekeeping service was impeccable but I have to say I was not impressed with the rest of the staff and for this reason I will probably not stay there again. I would expect the staff of a hotel of this caliber to provide excellent customer service and I agree with another reviewer that the front of house staff seemed young and not polished. When we arrived by Taxi we carried our bags into the hotel while the kid working the valet stayed at his stand. Not once during our stay did the gentlemen working the valet open the door for us and greet us. All we received was a smile as they continued to talk to each other about there personal lives. The front desk/concierge staff were cordial but did not go out of there way to make us feel welcome. In contrast when we went to the Wickaninnish Inn in Torfino they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. When we arrived they met our taxi offloaded our luggage and brought it to the check in desk. The person who cehcked us in then escorted us to our room and informed us about the particulars of our room, the hotel, and the area. Every time we would leave or arrive they would open the door and would ask us how our day was and if there is anything we needed. When we would ask the concierge about an activity or restaurant she would offer to book a reservation. The morning we left they had coffee waiting for us at check out. That is what I would have expected from the Wedgewood. Review #8:From the moment that we walked in to the Wedgewood it was a fantastic experience. The valet was efficient and we were checked in very speedily. The room was lovely, clean and well furnished. The bathroom was great. No detail was too small, down to the nice toiletries and great quality coffee. In the evening, there was water and cookies and a turn down service. Dinner in Bacchus was a treat, the food was excellent with a relaxed ambience. Our stay included the continental breakfast which was nice. Looks like they have a pretty good gym and the spa looks lovely. The location is great and near to the heart of Vancouver with all its attractions and good shopping. The courtesy, professionalism and warmth exuded by all the staff was exemplary...loved the total attention to detail. Will certainly be coming back again...very, very highly recommended. Congratulations to the staff at the Wedgewood...awesome! Review #9:Picked the Wedgewood Hotel for a short Vancouver vacation based on reviews here as well as Yelp.com. The Wedgewood is a smaller boutique hotel nestled among some stiff competition. The location is very central to Vancouver, once you get your bearings it's very doable to walk most places. Our room was on the 12th floor with a larger than you might expect veranda. The veranda had several large potted plants, round glass table and 4 chairs. A nice place to have a coffee in the AM or a cocktail in the afternoon. The bed was comfortable, room was equipped with a flat screen TV, and wifi is provided. Room as well as the rest of the hotel are tastefully decorated. Evening turn down included two fresh cookies every evening. The highlight of the Wedgewood was the staff. Every single staff member we encountered was friendly and very helpful. This type of service really set the Wedgewood apart from the majority of hotels we've stayed in (at this price point). If you stay here you won't be disappointed. Review #10:We chose to stay here for our first few nights in Canada on our honeymoon. We could not have picked a better place. The service was incredible. Everyone is so friendly. My husband bought a baseball bat and ball and was even offered a game- it totally won him over!! The rooms were large, comfy and very clean. We had a large balcony and enjoyed looking down on the bustling street. We loved this place so much we came back two more times during our road trip!!! I would absolutely stay here again. Review #11:We stayed at this delightful hotel for 3 nights in September, 2006 just before boarding our cruise ship. It is in a wonderful position, close to all the shops and we were given a lovely front room. We had a weekend package with bed and breakfast which we felt was good value. The only downside was that we ate in their Bacchus Restaurant one night and we felt the meal was rushed. We were out within 45 minutes which to us was far too rapid. We do like to linger over a meal especially when we are paying top dollar. That is our only criticism of a great hotel. Review #12:Visiting family in Vancouver this year we decided to spend a few nights at the Wedgewood....what a delight! This hotel came highly recommended and we were not disappointed very friendly staff who always had a smile, lively bar & restaurant and just lovely rooms. We did not get a room overlooking Robson Square but it didn't matter this place is all about quality, bed linens, marble showers, soaker tubs, furniture and the most comfortable beds. One nice touch is the business center on the second floor, good speed computers are available for guests use at no extra charge, we could stay in touch with our family back in the UK daily without worrying about being charged a fortune. Very well done to everyone at the Wedgewood we will return. Review #13:The Wedgewood Hotel is one of my favourite places to be! When it comes to service, value, atmosphere, professional/friendly staff, large, well equipped rooms, you will not find a better hotel. From the moment you enter the front lobby you can feel the pressures of your day wash away. We always enjoy the service and food quality at The Bacchus lounge and restaurant. (The restaurant is on the higher end but for a special occasion it is the best!) The hotel is very central to all that Vancouver has to offer! Review #14:I stayed at the Wedgewood Hotel for 5 nights in February 2005 with my husband and my baby son. I have stayed in many great hotels before and I must say that the Wedgewood has been one of the best; I would not hesitate to go back. The room was perfect, with all the commodities but with an extra touch (we stayed in one of the Wedgewood Suites - greatly reduced rates in the winter months! ), the service was outstanding (the staff was great with our 18 months old son even though this was clearly not a place where many babies get taken) and the location couldn't be better (right in the middle of all the shops and restaurants in Downtown Vancouver). The little touches we appreciated: being given a private area in the Bacchus restaurant and bar lounge so that we could sip some cocktails while keeping our son with us (children are not admitted in the main bar), the amazing room service (great food from the Bacchus restaurant - the desserts are a pure delight - and the service is faultless), the unexpected baby toiletries in the room, the best blueberry pancakes I've ever tasted and the complementary Belgium chocolates and nightly freshly baked cookies. I did not get to try the spa which I regret and the gym room is a bit small but it does have all the usual required equipment. There is no swimming pool which is a shame but I really don't see where they could fit one anyway. I loved the Bacchus restaurant - for Breakfast, you get to sit in big comfortable armchairs by the fireplace (with a roaring fire in it in the winter!). Although we didn't get to eat there in the evenings because of our son's bedtimes, the restaurant certainly was very popular, always full, with live piano music every night. We had the opportunity to sample the food via Room Service and it was excellent. Review #15:The Wedgewood is a wonderful hotel in every respect. The rooms are lovely. The service is impeccable. The location is great. We arrived at the hotel before check-in time and our room was not ready. The woman at the desk suggested some places of interest nearby, and I asked some questions about some of the attractions we planned to visit during our stay. When we returned to the hotel a few hours later, this woman had taken the initiative during our absence to gather some information about the sights I'd asked about, and print the public transportation routes off the internet. That was a great service touch. Our room was beautiful and well appointed. Staff went out of their way during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. The bar area is wonderful-- a great place to start with breakfast in the morning and end the evening with a nightcap. For those who, like me, prefer an elegant boutique hotel to a sterile chain, the Wedgewood is the perfect spot in Vancouver. Review #16:Stayed at the Wedgewood for 5 nights on our recent holiday and whilst it was the most expensive accomodation of our hols it was well worth the money. As said by others the little touches such as cookies and the chocolates on arrival make the place stick in the memory. Great location just off Robson Street makes everywhere walkable in a city that is a joy to walk around. Also had a meal in the hotel restaraunt \"Bachus\" which was excellent, i'd recommend going for a meal even if your not staying at the hotel, great food in elegant surroundings. All in all a very enjoyable stay in a hotel that has the peresonal touch. On a previous visit we stayed in the Fairmont Waterfront which is another fantastic hotel but i think the Wedgewood pips it for it's little touches as well as it's great rooms. Review #17:My husband and I walked into the Wedgewood after leaving the hotel we had booked (the Opus, which was horrible). We were at the end of a long business travel swing, and wanted somewhere that would work for us both for business and for relaxing. The Wedgewood is definitely quirky--the decor is so dated it's new again (high late-sixties-to-early-seventies), the gym teeny, the bar so retro it's got a piano guy. I had seen pictures of the rooms online, and had my doubts about the in-room tubs. but the rooms were spotless, the service excellent, the location great. prices weren't bad, either. we booked a suite; it's been perfect, comfortable and cozy and spacious and very very very quiet and well-maintained. Staff members are friendly and professional, too. The phone lines are a bit crackly, and there's no ipod docking station (though there are flat-screen tvs) but there's a lot of thoughtfulness and comfort here. Review #18:Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Wedgewood, and was almost sad to leave the hotel. The bed was beautiful, big, and so comfortable. The room and the bathroom were roomy. The toiletries are wonderfully scented. I'd read all about the welcome box of truffles and the nightly cookies and water along with turndown service, but it still felt like a special treat. The location was ideal, truly in the heart of a great and very walk-able downtown. We had a great view from a 10th floor room. I must say that we don't generally stay at places that are this highly rated, so my expectations maybe aren't as high as people who frequently stay at places like this. We got such a GREAT rate as part of their winter discounts, that we almost felt guilty about it :) The staff was personable and very helpful the couple of times we needed directions, or help making reservations (but again we weren't very demanding people). One major thing I noted is that we very rarely heard other guests while in our room. We could hear a door close every now and then, but other than that it felt like we had the entire floor to ourselves. It was a nice surprise because often we feel like a lot of hotels have paper-thin walls. Oh if you stay here, do yourself a favor and book a dinner at the Bacchus restaurant (part of the hotel). It's an expensive restaurant but it is worth every penny. Superb service and even better food. Overall, a great experience and we hope they will run more off-season deals so that we have the opportunity to stay there again. Review #19:My husband and I have just returned from 3 nights at the Wedgewod hotel in Vancouver. It was pure luxury in the executive king suite with balcony. It even had a bar in the room with bar stools. The facilities were exceptional including a giant size soak tub for 2. Comfortable, clean, great service, excellent lounge bar for cocktails and good restaurant. My only comment is that the restaurant is quite formal but do go at least once - the food is excellent. Review #20:Based in the centre of Vancouver with the harbour 7 blocks to the left and the beach 7 blocks to the right of the main entrance. A perfect central location for exploring Vancouver. A very plush hotel. Specious elegant rooms. Excellent service. The staff were very courteous. Review #21:Over the years, I have stayed at the Wedgewood a few times for both business and pleasure. This past November, my husband and I stayed here for a long weekend, and we enjoyed this hotel a fair amount. The location is very good - near the art gallery, shopping, and walking distance (or a short cab ride) to many restaurants. However, we both felt the hotel is in need of some renovation. It's not changed in a decade (at least, possibly longer), and some of the fixtures and decore are dated. Also, our room was near the elevator, despite having asked for a quiet room. This was a disappointment. Still, the service was very good, and our room had a nice view of the park. We enjoyed our time, but would in the future likely choose a hotel that was either built for or updated as a result of the Olympics. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families. I did not use the gym, but my husband did. He said it that calling it a gym is a stretch - more of a work-out bathroom really. Review #22:stayed at the wedgewood for 5 nights and can not praise it enough from check in after a long flight to a very early morning check out everything was great,lovely suite with some nice touches(biscuits and sherry on arrival) homemade cookies and bottled water each night. room service was good and had a great meal in the bacchus restaurant quite pricey but not too expensive for a special treat, location was very central but vancouver is not an enormous city and we found it very walkable.All in all we would go again and be happy to stay at the wedgewood. Review #23:Three girlfriends and I spoiled ourselves with spa services and room service during our stay! What a treat to get out of town with great friends and then get treated like royalty at Wedgewood Hotel & Spa! Can't wait til our next getaway. I may even make reservations to take my husband back for a romantic weekend. Review #24:Tired and overpriced. We had a mid floor \u201csuite.\u201d Suite is a misnomer. The room was old and tired. The tv in the bedroom was bolted to the ceiling. The tv in the sitting area, was a beat-up old RCA. The bedroom part of the \u201csuite\u201d was cramped. Rather than a door separating the rooms, there was a stained thick tapestry/window curtain. The furniture was old and tired. The walls were dreary, dank and simply depressing. Service was not up to par for the price. The recommendation for a dinner was awful \u2013 don\u2019t rely on the concierge. Overall DEFINITLEY NOT at all worth the price charged. Also, the garbage trucks that frequent the ally are loud. Look elsewhere. Something good \u2013 the chocolates that they leave for you are delicious. Review #25:Well presented hotel. Rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. Good location for downtown Vancouver. Lots of positives. Make sure you get a room at the front (overlooking Hornby St) as a room to the rear has a terrible view and the noise from the alley below starts at 5:30am. Overall, would recommend for a short stay. Review #26:The Bacchus bar/lounge/restaurant is so civilized. I find this type of boutique hotel charming and as a single for the most part traveller I feel very safe here. It is a perfect location. The welcome box of chocolates are superb and the evening turndown with cookies and water is so nice. Review #27:This was our 5th stay at this hotel in the last 2 years. We always stay in the deluxe executive,and it is first class, (especially for romantic escapes). The hotel is perfectly located just off of robson street, which is perfect for shopping and checking out downtown restaurants. The executive room is spacious, well lit, and the bathtub for two in the corner of the room is spectacular. We try to book when the free valet parking and breakfast at Baccus. We have stayed at many downtown hotels (pan pacific, wall centre, sutton place) but this is the best of the lot, and we will continue to stay there. On one of our stays, the hotel didn't live up to the bar they had set for themselves. I contacted the manager, and he pleaded with us to let them make it up to us, and make it up they did, in a BIG way.. The whole Wedgewood experience starts when you walk into the warm, inviting lobby. As you get off the elevator, the hallways smell of spiced pot pouri. The hotel rooms are very clean, and I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a romantic getaway... Review #28:We recently stayed at the Wedgewood for four nights while visiting Vancouver. It's a wonderful and quiet place to come home to after a long day of hiking and sightseeing. A little bit older and more sedate than the larger hotels but that is part of its charm. The staff is very helpful and accomodating. A suggestion - if you are thinking of going to Whistler for the day, Avis is only one block away and it is an easy drive. They open at 7:00am and have late night drop off arrangements. You can stay at the Wedgewood and still have a full day in Whistler without changing hotels. Special rates are sometimes available for the Wedgewood and, if you can find one, you can stay in a nice luxury boutique hotel for about the same price or only a little more than the mass market ones the cruise lines use. Review #29:We spent time in Vancouver for the weekend. The hotel was amazing. Beautiful decor, clean, and tasteful. The staff were very hospitable and professional. The restaurant was amazing! Food was great! Have to try it. The room was very spacious and well appointed with high quality linens. Location was perfect. It was a quick walk to everything. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #30:Vancouver has so many great hotel options that it was difficult to choose. We chose the Wedgewood because it ranked high with Trip Advisor AND because it was recommended by two different couples we ran into while traveling who are Vancouver locals. From the moment you arrive at the entry untilnthe day you depart you are treated as a celebrity. We had a King Suite for a week as this was a special 25 th Anniversary celebration. Vancouver was our original honeymoon destination so we were excited to return. Wow! This is a boutique hotel. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. The bed pillows were awesome as were the linens. Fresh cookies were delivered every evening as was ice. Coffee was replenished twice a day if needed. The hotel bar is upscale but comfortable and inviting. Guests are treated to live piano music (Elton John/Billie Joel style) every evening. The Wedgewood is in the heart of downtown and not on the water so the views are more reminiscent of city culture vs. the harbor. It is an easy walk every where. The only cab ride we took was from and back to the airport. Vancouver offers many, many great restaurants sand many of them are in the downtown area near this restaurant. There is shopping all around the hotel. LV, Gucci, Hermes or head in another direction for China town and street vendors. Review #31:The hotel rooms and decor are super combined with a great location (if there is such a thing in downtown Vancouver). The location being very close to downtown Vcr gets busy in the small lounge/breakfast room with non residents. In our view this hotel is extremly pretentious, A Maitre`d that floats around whilst the hard working breakfast staff cant cope and need help, food that is pretty to look at and very adventourous but falls well short of haute cuisine. Whilst the rooms are comfortable and spacious and the cookies at night are a nice touch, there the most expensive cookies you will ever buy. Overall a very expensive hotel. Review #32:My wife and I just returned from spending a long winter weekend at the Wedgewood between Jan 4 and 8, 2006. After reading the near flawless reviews of the Wedgewood, with great anticipation we booked a junior suite. We found slightly lower pricing on the hotel's web site and ended up paying about $185 USD on average per night. We were assigned a room on 11th floor and, although close to the elevator, we couldn't hear a thing. Overall, the staff is fantastic and the hotel is well appointed but for those expecting a 'W' type room experience, the Wedgewood might be a little disappointing. While comfortable, the room had very small TVs and the bathroom, considering we were in a junior suite, was surprisingly small. While I still would rate the experience close to a 9 out of 10, we frankly thought the hotel room would have slightly better amenities. Bottom line, the Wedgewood with its top notch customer service and location will not disappoint, however, this likely won't be the best hotel experience in a major international city. Review #33:We stayed here for 2 nights in May 2010 and were very impressed with the service from all staff and also for small touches such as free bottled water provided every day (3 bottles due to triple share), 3 sets of towels etc. Not always the case at other hotels. Location was excellent, close to all attractions and transport. I would recommend booking here if you manage to get one of their special rates. Also staff were extremely prompt in answering queries. I booked with the hotel directly and noticed that all my email queries and requests were answered promptly- takes a day at most for replies, which when you consider that I communicated from Aust was great service, Sheldon in particular was very pleasant. A great hotel, thoroughly recommended. Review #34:A very well run hotel without some of the annoying \"cool\" factor that affects some of the newer properties in the City. Highly professional and pleasant service. Rooms are a bit frayed at the seams - carpet, upholstery, furniture all a bit dated and ready for an upgrade, but the location is superb, and overall experience very satisfactory. Review #35:I recently stayed at the Wedgewood twice over a span of two weekends. For the first visit I was in a one bedroom suite... generously large by Vancouver standards... with an excellent hideabed mattress for my daughter. The second visit found me in a standard room... also spacious and refined. Breakfast at Bacchus was included both times, along with free valet parking. Location downtown was unbeatably close to Robson St shopping (1/2 block), restaurants like Coast and Joe Fortes (2 blocks), Vancouver Art Gallery (2 blocks), and Rogers Arena (7 blocks). I got a deal through the hotels website that was excellent. We look forward to coming back. Review #36:We were excited about staying at a hotel belonging to the Relais & Chateaux chain since we had not stayed at one in a while. Many aspects of the experience met our expectations. We had a nicely decorated small suite, and we found the valets who park the cars to be exceptionally friendly and helpful. We have folding bikes that we need to have stored, so we are more of a bother than most people to that part of the staff. But these men were full of good advice and cheerfully helped us whenever we asked. Also the restaurant is beautiful with a pleasant staff and good food. Our only real complaint was about the toilet in the bathroom of our suite. It leaked. Water formed around the hinges of the seat and on the floor of the room. We were told at the desk that condensation is a problem in Vancouver and that caused a problem with toilets. It is strange that we have stayed in Vancouver a half dozen times and never had this problem before. Housekeeping did put towels around the base of the toilet and controlled the situation somewhat. But I think that when the client is paying well in excess of $300 per night, the bathroom should function correctly. They did half heartedly offer to move our room, but indicated that all of the toilets had this problem, some less than others. Because of this problem, we would not stay at this hotel again.l Review #37:My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Wedgewood for our honeymoon. They upgraded our room at no additional cost and gave a beautiful suite with an amazing bathroom and large balcony. Unfortunately, we were next to a couple of rooms being renovated and were awoken every morning (8 AM) to loud noises. However, it only mildly hampered our stay, as everything else was outstanding. Our first night there we ate at the hotel restaurant and were treated very well. They made us special vegetarian dishes that were definitely 5 star meals. We also received complimentary champagne and dessert once the pianist told them we were on our honeymoon! The room was luxurious and the entire staff was overwhelmingly helpful and friendly. I will definitely be staying there again the next time I'm in Vancouver. I'd recommend this to anyone who can afford a little pampering. Review #38:The Wedgewood was fantastic. My husband and I stayed during the weekend of the finale of the Celebration Of Light fireworks. The staff was amazing. Not only did they leave chocolates and wine in the room for us, the housekeeping staff was pleasant and well trained and the valet staff was polite and courteous. I would definitely recommend this hotel to ANYBODY and we'll definitely be going back when we have the time! ! Review #39:My fiance & I spent a few nights at the Wedgewood Hotel at the end of Oct 2005. We loved the hotel. Like others who've reviewed this hotel, we were upgraded to a suite. There were complimentary chocolates - such a treat! The hotel looked a little stuffy, but the staff certainly wasn't. The room was really spacious, and the bathroom was spectacular. It had a separate shower area with a glass door, along with a full bath. The cookies at turndown made us feel truly pampered. We ate one evening at Bacchus. The food was fantastic, but we were a bit unprepared wardrobe-wise for the elegance. Despite our being underdressed, we got the same special service as everybody else. My one complaint was that sometimes the water pressure was low, & there was little hot water. Aside from that, I LOVED my stay. The hotel is in a great location - easy to access the shopping & great restaurants that Vancouver has to offer. I can't wait to return! Review #40:I just returned from a stay at the Wedgewood. I love old-world, boutique hotels. The Wedgewood's lobby and restaurant were beautiful and lived up to my expectations. Also, the location is great. However, my room was dated and tired. Until the hotel refurbishes its rooms, I would choose to stay at another hotel in Vancouver. Review #41:I was just at the Wedgewood for one night and was not as impressed with it as I had expected to be, based on the website and reviews. The blousy Olde Englishe decor is fussy and overbearing, and not even well executed - the woodwork is cheaply done and the hallways narrow and dimly lit. This may have been a \"boutique\" hotel at one time, but nowadays, people expect something a little smarter, classier and more polished. On the plus side, a great location, and wonderful staff. Review #42:I was thrilled upon entering the gorgeous Wedgewood Hotel and Spa. I trust the Relais & Chateux brand, and it lived up to its luxurious standard. The room was large and included a terrace the length of the apartment-like suite. Comfortable amenities abounded, including full living room furniture, DVD players for the flat-screen televisions, large marble bathrooms, and delightful turndown service complete with cookies and spring water. Bacchus lounge and restaurant in the hotel's lobby was a fabulous place to enjoy a martini next to a roaring fire. Service was impeccable, and the location ideal. I'd absolutely go back to the Wedgewood. Review #43:We stayed here for 5 nights for part of our honeymoon and just thought it was wonderful. We really feel like we couldn't have picked a better hotel in Vancouver. The lobby, bar and restaurant are beautifully decorated - very opulent. We spent many an hour enjoying cocktails in the bar in the evening - it had a wonderful atmosphere. We enjoyed 2 evening meals in the restaurant which were superb, the food was out of this world. The breakfasts managed to better those that we had enjoyed in our hotel in Banff - an impressive achievement! We were lucky enough to be given an upgrade to our room, which was beautiful. It had a balcony with a great view of the Art Gallery and the city, and a spa bath in the corner of the room. The bathroom was lovely with a huge walk-in shower. It was a nice touch that someone left cookies for us each evening when they did the turn-down service. All the staff were extremely helpful and polite - we felt very at home even though it was obviously a big treat for us to be staying in a hotel of this quality. The bar and restaurant service was extremely organised and attentive - they seemed to anticipate things you need before you thought of them yourself! The location of the hotel couldn't have been better - it really is in the heart of downtown. We were very sad to leave and would love to travel back one day to stay again. Review #44:Stepping into the Wedgewood is to step into an oasis of calm, where staff remember who you are and greet you by name. You feel as if you are returning to a stately old, gracious home. The hotel is beautifully and tastefully refurbished. Bathrooms are modern and elegant. The \"mod cons\" are present, but ever so discreet. Suites and guest rooms are luxuriously comfortable. There is a suberb restaurant, with an award winning chef, where the food is always outstanding. The restaurant is decorated Victorian style, with comfortable sofas and armchairs. It provides both casual or intimate dining spaces, especially if one is lucky enough to be seated in front of the beautiful fireplace. And then there is the spa. To the weary traveller, there's no better place to relax! The Wedgewood is truly a gem, situated in the heart of Vancouver's shopping, business and entertainment areas. A beautiful hotel in a beautiful location for those lucky enough to experience it and its special ambience. Review #45:Not nearly a great value for the money. The staff smiles more than it performs and made some mistakes that embarassed us and the couple in the room to which they sent us. Lots of apologies, but clearly, practiced and symbolic politeness. The room itself was in fact no better than many others for much, much less in Vancouver, and not nearly the quality of niche hotels there and in Seattle. The bar was friendly and good, the continental breakfast average and it was nice to get the chocolates and cookies with turndown. But, it's not nearly the value of other niche hotels in the city, or even some of its nearby, traditional competitors. We were disappointed. Review #46:The 20 participants in our conference were unanimous in their praise of the service provided by each and every member of the hotel staff, from the first experience at check-in through to the incredibly attentive team that saw to our needs thoughout the day. The old world charm and general ambience of the hotel set the tone for our conference and certainly put the team in the right frame of mind for inventive and collaborative thinking. We would not hestitate to recommend the Wedgewood to customers, colleagues, friends , and family. Review #47:I second the reviews that were put up about this hotel. I managed to get a good rate for the three nights that three of us were at the hotel. No real view but well appointed rooms and good beds. Wi fi and tv worked, etc The staff is wonderful, people remember your name and what you like. I fell in love with one of the staff, Wanda, the Breakfast Goddess, she remembered what we like to eat and had it waiting for us when we went down in the morning. Lovely, kind lady, who deserves special mention. All of the staff were nice and seemed surprised and grateful to be tipped tho I saw others tipping them as well. A well trained group of people. Hotel is in the middle of a busy commercial section as are most of the hotels, no parking on the street and yes, everything, but everything, is expensive in Vancouver. Hotel is a nice choice. Review #48:We stayed at the Wedgewood Hotel in downtown Vancouver for our third anniversary and were not disappointed in the least! Our room was rather spacious and located on the east side overlooking the courthouses, art museum and gardens. I have never seen an oversized bathtub located not in the bathroom, but in the sleeping area itself! Made it quite unique and fun!! Location of the hotel is near most shopping and restaurants so it makes things quite accessible.Service was extremely prompt and courteous in everything that they did. We needed extra coffee....and there it was....in less than 5 minutes!! The front desk was always helpful and able to answer our every question about Vancouver. The lounge area was romantic, mysterious and comfortable for either drinks, dessert, or breakfast! When we come back to Vancouver in the future, we would definately stay at the Wedgewood again! Dinner at West again too!! ! Review #49:I stayed at the Wedgewood at the end of January when I was in Vancouver on a business trip. I enjoyed my stay. I was in an Executive room with two double beds and the room was very nice. Our room view was really only into the next building, but the weather wasn't the best so it didn't matter. I thought my bed was great. The bathroom was super clean - always a plus! I also had a facial at the Spa and loved every minute of that. The staff at the Spa were very gentle and my skin and I enjoyed the treatment very much. Review #50:We spent three wonderful days in this beautiful, stylish hotel. The room was appointed with a very comfortable sofa and wing chair and small bar at the one end. In the bedroom was an amazingly comfortable king bed with top end linens . Both living and bedroom had large windows overlooking Robson Square and both rooms featured large flat screen TVs. The big winner in this room was the gorgeous shower and separate deep bathtub, again with the high quality linens and amenities. Every person we encountered in the Wedgewood was both professional and very accommodating. Check in was a breeze and the elevators are both fast and secure. Each floor only has eight rooms, so you are never far from the elevator. Be aware that parking is by valet at additional cost but is quick and the service is as friendly as every other department in this property. We look forward to returning next spring for our thirtieth anniversary. Review #51:We stayed for two nights at the Wedgewood and found it delightful. Our room, 8th floor, was large and handsomely furnished and equipped. The staff was friendly and efficient. A fine continental breakfast was provided each morning. Our meals at the in-house lounge/restaurant - the Bacchus-- - were excellent. We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Vancouver and looking for a special place to spend some time enjoying. Review #52:We stayed for 3 nights in a jr. suite king room which had a living room and bedroom with drapery across the doorway between and a small balcony. We were on the back of the hotel so there was no view, but it was quiet. (Currently Robson Sq. across from the front of the hotel is under construction, so I doubt any \"views\" are great right now.) The service was excellent--understated, friendly and professional. Entire property was elegant and well maintained with top quality amenities throughout. This is a small, refined European style hotel with a quiet, reserved atmosphere decorated in muted colors and historical prints. It is centrally located in the downtown area and everything downtown is within walking distance. There are many small cafes and restaurants nearby. The hotel bar and restaurant is lovely with excellent food and cocktails (and pricey)--dark panelled wood, velvet drapes and a fireplace. We enjoyed cocktails and dessert one evening and breakfast one morning. The room included free internet; the wireless worked well, but was rather slow; the wired connection in our room worked intermittently which might be an issue if work was a prime activity. We were treated to cookies each evening in our room which was a nice touch. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Review #53:The best thing about the Wedgewood is the location. It is right across the street from the Vancouver Art Museum and one block from world class shopping. The hotel itself is small but inviting and has a very proper english vibe. It is luxurious without being too over the top. The rooms are small but very nice and the bathrooms seem newly updated. The restaurant/bar downstairs had good food and fun live music at night. The staff is very friendly and helpful, so much that you feel like they know you as soon as you check in. The workout facility was a bit small as it was tucked into one small area just past the spa and it only offered one treadmill, one bike, one eliptical machine and a small weight set. Overall a very nice hotel that has a great location downtown. Review #54:My husband and I stayed here for our wedding night after having our intimate reception dinner in Bacchus restaurant (part of Wedgewood Hotel). It's a beautiful hotel but I still feel as though it's overpriced. I paid about $350 or $400 (can't quite remember now as it was 8 months ago) for the one night and I thought because I was spending about $1500 having my wedding dinner at Bacchus and it was my wedding night they would have given me a discount but they didn't. I was able to negotiate a late check-out (2pm, not that great) and they gave us a bottle of sparkling wine but that's about it. The room was beautiful with a jacuzzi tub and a nice big bed but, the more I think about it, it still wasn't worth the price necessarily. The hotel is definitely clean and definitely in a nice area. I would say this hotel is a great place to stay for a splurge - wedding night, anniversary, one night of a longer trip but I can't imagine it would be worth the $300 or more a night to stay here for a full week. Other fancy hotels would have more amenities and maybe a kitchenette in the room or something. Review #55:The hotel is situated down town close to the art museum. Upon arrival, we were given a suite on the 8th floor. The hallway to the suite and the suite itself both smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. To the hotels credit we were quickly transferred to a suite on the 6th floor - where this problem did not exist. We had a nice balcony - that was a good length and spotlessly clean, and the bathroom was modern - and the shower had great water pressure, but the bedroom and living room both showed their age. The living room was narrow and the TV armoire crowded the room from one side and the oversized 1990's type couch from the other. In my opinion, the room furnishings need to be updated - while maintaining a classical look, and the wet bars - with drop ceilings definitely need \"work\". We had dinner at the hotel, our waiter was attentive and the dinner was very good, but nothing about it was truly memorable. (Nothing stood out as being unusual, creative, or the best ever) With all of that said, the service throughout the hotel was excellent. Review #56:We spent two nights at the Wedgewood during a recent holiday to Canada. We were extremely impressed with the hotel. It has a lovely atmosphere, it is small, personal, the staff are very friendly and it felt like a home from home. Our junior suite was lovely. Extremely spacious, and comfortable and it didn't feel like just another hotel room. The hotel also benefits from being in a fantastic location right in the center of downtown, which helped make exploring Vancouver very easy. P.S the cookies at turndown are super! Review #57:Trip Advisor has rarely given us bad advice in our travels and very definitely was spot on about the Wedgewood! This property was on par with such boutique wonders like the Rusty Parrot in Jackson Hole and the Covent Garden Hotel in London. In fact, when we walked in and were greeted by every member of the staff, and then saw the Bacchus restaurant/bar, we remarked how reminiscent of the Covent Garden it seemed. The only disappointment was the size of the spa which had few facilities besides some treatment rooms, but the treatments and technicians were SUPERB! Extremely convenient downtown location allowed us to walk to a lot of places and loved the energy and everything about it! Review #58:We stayed for three nights at the Wedgewood in a Deluxe Executive King under the 25 Anniversary Promotion. We received 25% off the room plus 25% off all meals in Bacchus. We ate breakfast everyday at the hotel and had one dinner at Bacchus as well. The staff accomodated every request and were very pleasant. We were addressed by name most of the time. During our stay on Saturday, the entire street in front of the hotel (Hornby) was closed for a city block due to a large crane loading glass into a building across the street. The hotel was very apologetic about the situation, but it had little bearing on anything other than trying to get a cab. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! Review #59:Thank goodness we were staying at The Wedgewood because it poured rain for the entire week. We found ourselves looking forward to returning to our hotel each day and night. The linens are lovely and the twice daily housekeeping visit was much appreciated. We decided to check out for two days for a quick visit to Whistler and the hotel offered to keep some or our luggage so that we could travel lightly. Oh yes and the location is just great. We will definitely stay there next time. Review #60:My wife and I stayed at the Wedgwood in April 2006 and paid about $200 per night. The rooms were very nice and we enjoyed the large tub in the bedroom. However, the service at this hotel is best described as indifferent. The front desk (more of a corner desk actually) was not helpful. The staff seemed young (I am 36) with very little insight into the local sights or how to even get around. They are not rude or even unpleasant but just don\u2019t seem to really care. I don\u2019t blame them but I also would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is not familiar with the city. Review #61:This is a very nice, cozy boutique hotel. I had a standard room and it was very spacious. The linens and the bed were absolutely luxurious! The balcony was not your usual step out...it was huge with room for a table and chairs -- would have been wonderful to sit outside in the summer. The hotel is close to Robson street so lots of shopping and restaurant choices -- really nice area. The lobby and lounge are beautiful with an old world feel. The chocolates in the room and the welcome note from the hotel owner were nice. The front desk and restaurant staff were nice and helpful...and so was the doorman who worked there in the morning. The younger staff who were at the door in the afternoon could brush up a bit on customer service...no offer of assistance with my luggage, no eye contact or greeting as i reached the door--basically it seemed that they did not want to be there...it was a little annoying. Review #62:Several friends and I stopped by the Bacchus lounge on Friday night and had a fantastic time. Great atmosphere, wide array of late evening drinks (e.g., single malts, port, martinis, etc) and amazing desserts. We sampled three of their dessert options and were blown away. We've stayed at the Wedgewood before and marvelled at the service and the restaurant was no different. We were seated quickly and the wait staff was attentive but not intrusive. To top it off, we were brought (free of charge) a basket of seasonal fruit and nuts to graze on as we finished our drinks... Definitely one of the best rooms in the city, with service to match. Review #63:This review is long overdue. My husband and I stayed at the Wedgewood for four nights while on vacation in June 2007. We had a lovely stay, and everyone on staff was wonderful. The rooms were elegantly appointed and comfortable, the bar has to be one of the best hotel bars in North America, and the location near Robson Street is excellent. Great attention to every detail. I have to single out the folks in the kitchen at Bacchus, however, for they truly went the extra mile for us. During our first full day in Vancouver we pulled up several tasty-looking Dungeness crabs while salmon fishing near the Fraser River. Lee Parsons and his talented sous chef graciously agreed to prepare some of the crabs for us for dinner that night, and what a feast! The tarragon beurre blanc was divine, and the accompaniments were perfect. It will easily be one of the more memorable meals my husband and I have had together. If you want an extra-indulgent stay in Vancouver, this is the place. Review #64:I had our top clients in Vancouver from the U.K. One of them is well traveled and a gourmet fiend. I was hosting a dinner and chose Bacchus Restaurant at the Wedgewood Hotel because I trusted them completely to make the evening a success - and they did, in spades. Our waiter helped me negotiate through the wine list so I didn't bankrupt our company but didn't embarass ourselves in front of our clients. The service throughout the dinner was superb and lacked nothing. The food presentation was terrific and everyone enjoyed their choice. Most importantly, the service was sincere and not put-on - the team clearly wanted to ensure our dinner was perfect. Prior to dinner, we had cocktails in the bar - Christine, our server, was super attentive and adapted to the various \"styles\" of our guests - some were serious , some were more relaxed - she \"read\" each perfectly. Our clients have entered into a long term partnership with our company because they value the commitment to high quality and service we think our company delivers. When asked why I chose to bring them to Bacchus at the Wedgewood - I said for the same reason - I value them and more importantly, trust them to do the right thing - all the time. Review #65:An expensive hotel, but each room with balcony (good for smoking in a non-smoking city), half the balconies overlook beautiful Federal Court square. Good location right downtown. Quiet, with accomodating and professional service. You're paying for what you get. Make sure your room overlooks the square - the other side overlooks office buildings. Review #66:I just got married over the July 4th weekend and spent a few absolutely wonderful days and nights at the Wedgewood Hotel. My new husband and I decided to pamper ourselves in town at the Wedgewood before we set forth on our honeymoon. The room we were provided was luxurious and the service was top notch. We both relaxed in the expert hands of the masseurs at the spa and enjoyed sumptious dinners at Bacchus Restaurant in the hotel. By the way, Bacchus has the best martinis in town! I can't wait to book us in for our first anniversary celebration. Review #67:Our first trip to Vancouver and we lucked out with the Wedgewood recommendation. The room amenities are first class. The staff is friendly and well informed. The location is great for seeing the city and after a long day you feel at home once you come through the doors. The restaurant is excellent. We highly recommend this hotel. Review #68:The Wedgewood hosted our Wedding ceremony in early September. We are living in Florida but traveled to Vancouver to share our celebration with family. The staff at the Wedgewood made the entire event, from planning to post-event, a remarkable experience. They epitomize \"outstanding service\". We were so pleased with the experience that we chose the hotel to pamper mom with an afternoon at their spa for her birthday. The look on her face afterwards was \"priceless\". Thanks!! Brian and Cynthia Review #69:We just stayed in one of the newly rennovated penthouse suites at the Wedgewood, and it was AMAZING!!!! We had a gorgeous, spacious living room with a fireplace and a big bathroom with a double size jacuzzi tub that opened into the bedroom. It was beautiful and truly first class. The bellman told us that Pierce Brosnan had just vacated our room after finishing his lastest movie! We had room service for dinner one night, and our waiter fussed over us to make sure everything was perfect! The food was delicious and in the mornings we had breakfast in our bathrobes on our private terrace - it felt like a scene out of Pretty Woman! I had a facial in the Spa that was the best I've ever had, and a fabulous massage. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!! This a great hotel. It has a very cosy, personal feel about it and the staff really make you feel like they care. There is a very hip crowd at the bar downstairs too, which is fun. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Vancouver with excellent service and a prime location - look no further! Book one of the new penhouse suites if you can - they are worth it! ! Review #70:OK we didn't like Vancouver, but loved this Hotel, which was the saving grace really. If shopping is your thing, this place is perfect as it's just around the corner from the main shopping street in Vancouver. The staff are very nice and attentive. The rooms are excellent, we stayed here for 2 nights before doing a Grizzly bear tour up the coast, then returned for a 3rd night before leaving Vancouver. We were upgraded on the 3rd night to a suite which was fantastic. I think Vancouver is one of those places you either love or hate, either way, this Hotel is well recommended. Review #71:From the moment you stand on the pavement outside the Wedgewood you are treated like royalty. The staff cannot do enough for you. We went there on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a gorgeous room with a complimentary bottle on the first night and chocolates on the second. Each night we also had fresh cookies left in the room when the staff did the turn down service :-) The room was spacious and comfortable with free wi-fi (something a lot of the hotels we stayed in did not offer). We did not eat in the restaurant but did go to the bar. Once again the service was excellent and the staff very friendly. The reception staff were also incredibly friendly and helpful when it came to ordering taxi's and suggesting things for us to do. I filled out a questionnaire about the hotel before we left and when we got back home there was a lovely letter from the hotel saying how much they appreciated the feedback. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Vancouver. We also stayed in the Pan Pacific which was nice but a lot more business like and given the choice again I would definitely choose the Wedgewood. Review #72:When we arrived (my 27 year old son and I) we found the valet parking available immediately. Staff were quick to gather out equipment and suitcases. Check in was a breeze...they welcomed me back again. Quick again for check-in. Room was very nice with two large beds (as planned and expected) but there were cookies and candies (unexpected) which made it a very welcoming impression. Staff asked if we needed information on where to eat, but we already had an idea of where to go. The room was quiet, on the back side of the hotel which was nice also. We had a good sleep. Despite our early checkout (5:45 am) staff had the car waiting out front and checkout took almost a minute. All in all another great stay at the Wedgewood. Review #73:My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. The hotel was beatifully presented and our room was spacious and included a very large bath tub which was accessed directly from the bedroom area - very original! The service was fine although one of the receptionists (long blonde hair) always struggled to raise a smile! The hotel is situated in a very good place, right in the heart of Vancouver and within walking distance of pretty much anything. No complaints at all and the cookies were a nice little extra. It makes you wonder why other hotels don't do a similar thing. Its funny how something that costs a hotel so little is the one thing most people remember.... Review #74:We had a large suite that was lovely but the furniture was not that comfortable.Depending on who was at the front desk the service could be excellen to poor. Breakfast and lunch in the restaurant were delicious and I did not think it was outrageously expensive. I just wish my check in process had been more pleasant and that the manager had actually called me when I asked for that to occur. I thought the assistant managet was very inefficient.. I think that this hotel can be wonderful when things go smoothly which did occur after the first day. For the price paid I expected top notch service in every regard on a regular basis. The location is fabulous. Review #75:This hotel is in a very noisy area - a hospital is close by and I believe a fire station. We heard sirens until midnight, then fell asleep. At 7 am, there was street construction noise. Besides that, the rooms were nice. I'd recommend the better suites to the minimal one bc it only has a drape to separate the rooms and the bathroom is in the sitting room (doesn't work well with kids). Also, the bedroom was small as was the sitting room. The staff is very friendly. Review #76:Very nice hotel. Good sized room, which seemed to have been recently refurbished. Bathroom looked new. Good location, close to the main shopping area and walkable to everything. Good restaurant recommendations from the staff. Nice bar and restaurant in the hotel, too. Seemed more intimate and friendly than the other top-end hotels in Vancouver. Review #77:My family surprised me by coming to Vancouver to visit and putting me up at the Wedgewood with them. So first I was lucky to have my family come for a visit, and second I was lucky to stay at the Wedgewood. The hotel is really beautiful. Definitely upscale but very unpretentious. I'm a casual person and don't like to go somewhere where I feel uncomfortable. I'd just written a week's worth of exams so didn't feel or look my best when I arrived. But no matter how I looked or felt, I was made to feel at home and very welcome by the staff at The Wedgewood. The rooms are beautiful and have a European feel to them. We didn't get a chance to use the big soaker tub in the room, but with more time I definitely would've indulged. We did, however, book deep tissue massages at the Spa located inside the hotel and I couldn't be more glad that we did because they were AMAZING. The massage was very necessary after the stress of exams and the using the steam room beforehand was invigorating, to say the very least. We had dinner at Bacchus Lounge on our first night and the food & service were impeccable. I'm on a very restrictive diet at the moment and the chef was more than accommodating when I had to make numerous adjustments to the menu items. Everything tasted fantastic and was beautifully prepared. Our entire party of seven were very pleased with their meals. I cannot wait to stay at the Wedgewood again! Look no further when deciding where to stay in our beautiful city of Vancouver! Review #78:We were so pleasantly surprised by the Wedgewood Hotel. We visited Vancouver during all-time-record-breaking heat and the Wedgewood was like a sanctuary in the middle of the hot city. Every time we came back to the room we were able to slip between the cold sheets and refresh and rejuvenate. Within 30 minutes of checking in, everyone on the staff knew our names and they went out of their way to make our stay just wonderful. The restaurant is just delicious and the room (we had a suite) was just right, luxurious and elegant, without being over the top. Review #79:We booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews for a last minute night away, and were very happy with the choice. The hotel is lovely, well appointed, and the rooms were beautiful. We had a great view of downtown Vancouver, and really enjoyed the room. The only small problem was that our room was not ready at check in, but they switched our floors and brought us to a room as quickly as possible. We had lunch and drinks in the attached restaurant which also has a great atmosphere. We were able to walk throughout downtown very easily. Great choice, and we'll be back. Review #80:I wanted to try this hotel because of the location to shopping - I normally stay at the Pan Pacific. I was not disappointed. We tried out the sauna in the spa and the amenities were excellent - great on a cold and rainy day. They have computers in the business center which are free - with small screens and slow access but better than nothing! Every single hotel staff that we encountered asked if they could do anything for us - every one was friendly and kind. The bathroom was my favorite - oversized tub and gorgeous tile. Hand held shower head - both the towels and the sheets were of the highest quality. I will definitely stay at this hotel again. We didn't try the bar or restaurant instead went down the street to the restaurant at the Blue Horizon hotel. Review #81:WE loved this hotel. The people were quite nice and helpful at the desk. Service was impeccable and our rooms were quite large with a balcony. Great location and the bar restaurant is awesome with the windows opened up onto the street- felt like a quaint French hotel. It earns it's Relais Chateau rating. Review #82:From the minute the valet staff greeted us we were made to feel at home. The room (one king and a separate area pullout) was immaculate with a beautiful, updated bathroom. We decided to eat at the inhouse restaurant, Bacchus, the food was delicious, the service was pleasing. Due to the piano bar being right next to the restaurant it was a tad difficult to have an easy conversation, it seemed, however, there were tables further from the bar area. The location couldn't have been better just a few steps from Robson Street. We would definitely go back. Review #83:When we arrived we were greeted by an exceptionally friendly valet - this was a pattern as all of the valets we interacted with were friendly and helpful, as were the reception staff. This was useful during our stay, as the concierge seemed to have little knowledge of the city. We were upgraded to a 2 room, 2 bathroom suite on check-in and the room did, as requested, overlook the square. Unfortunately there was a lot of building work going on, so it was not an attractive or quiet view, but not the hotel's fault. The suite was large, although with a slightly awkward layout, and the ensuite had a large spa bath with a large hatch through to the bedroom so that someone in the bath could watch the bedroom TV or converse with their partner in the bedroom. Overall I would say that the hotel is very luxurious (and priced accordingly), but good value compared to some hotels we stayed in BC and AB. Review #84:Elegant yet friendly. Great location in downtown. Super staff. They had the answers to our every question. Cookies and Chococolates to die for . In addition, we spent a fabulous evening in the Bacchus Restaurant celebrating our anniversary. We'd go back in a flash. Review #85:I surprised my husband with a birthday weekend at the Wedgewood. I booked on the special occasion package that they offer and we weren't disappointed at all. We were in a deluxe executive room on the 9th floor. The bed was really confortable and the shower was great. We got a voucher for the Bacchus restaurant which was fantastic. Well worth it even without the voucher. The continental breakfast was included with the package and started our mornings off on the right foot. My husband enjoyed a pot of coffee and I enjoyed a hot chocolate with our yogurt parfaits and two pasteries each. We sat and slowly had our breakfast as we people watched from comfy leather chairs and read the complimentary newspaper. The service was first rate and everyone greeted us with a smile. Thanks to everyone at the Wedgewood for making my husband's birthday a truly special occasion. Review #86:We stayed here during our trip to Canada and Alaska for just 2 nights before going on our cruise. We had a great room with balcony and hugh tub in the bedroom! The bar had a great atmosphere and the restaurant was fantastic. Staff very helpful and friendly. All round a very classy place to stay and although not cheap it was a bargin compared to our other hotel The Westin Bayshore!! The only thing missing for us was a nice outdoor terrace to relax with a glass of wine and catch some sun. Stay here and you wont be disappointed Review #87:This is an excellent European-style hotel in Vancouver. It was a repeat visit and the positive views we formed on our previous visits were enhanced. Front desk staff were more than helpful, especially when we left some clothing behind which was found and sent to us very efficiently. The location is excellent, sufficiently away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk everywhere in the centre. The room, a junior suite, was large and very comfortable with separate living and sleeping areas. The biscuits at turndown are a small sign of the delicate touches that the hotel provides. All-in-all another good visit. Review #88:We stayed at the Wedgewood for two nights in July and were very impressed. The rooms are very big for a city centre hotel and well appointed. Beds wonderful! We did not eat at the restaurant but only because the hotel is so centrally placed that we ate out all of the time. A special mention should go to the front desk staff who were really friendly, helpful and smartly turned out. Would definately stay there again. Review #89:We stayed at the Wedgewood after spending a weekend in Whistler and immediately wished we had more than just one night in town. Wedgewood is a charming boutique hotel in a nice area of Vancouver. There were so many extras, from the sunken tub, turn down service, fresh cookies and chocolates. Our room had a great portable map for suggested walks/runs and we took the four mile loop through Stanley park, which was great. We really felt like the staff was looking out for us. We can't wait to come back! Review #90:A very classy hotel. A box of high quality chocolates and a personalized hand written welcome note were already in the room. We stayed in one of the large suites with 2 separate bathrooms (not one of the penthouses). One has a roman marble shower and the other has a huge Jacuzzi tub with shutters that open up into the bedroom. An array of high-end toiletries in both bathrooms. The luxury bed was huge with top quality bedding. This is the cleanest hotel room we have ever stayed in. As soon as we pulled up and were greeted properly we new we had made a good choice. We visited the lively (even on a weekday) bar and stayed late, obviously popular with the rich, hip and unusual. If you enjoy requested birthday wishes from complete strangers and an oompa band announcing your arrival, stay somewhere else (please). This is a discreet hotel, there\u2019s a reason it is popular with movie stars! Everything was handled efficiently and pleasantly, the staff are all pros. Lots of attention to detail such as the doorman ensuring that my wife got into the car with out getting her hair wet when it was raining. We are looking forward to our next stay here. Review #91:This is a superb \"boutique\" hotel well located in the center of the city. It is right in the shopping and business district and close to tourist attractions. The staff are first rate. The Bacchus Restaurant in the hotel is over the top; the food is top notch and the setting is romantic. Cookies and chocolates were provided in the room at the end of the day and a newspaper was hung on the door in the morning. There was free in room WiFi. This was our second visit. The room was a delux King that was exceptionally well appointed. We plan to go back. Review #92:I travelled to Vancouver on business for many years and this hotel was my favorite. When making my reservations for my trips to Vancouver if no rooms were available at the Wedgewood I would change the date of my trip. The location is ideal just next to Robson street and a short walk from the bay. This boutique hotel pampers the guests. By far the best 5 star hotel in Vancouver. Review #93:We stayed at the Wedgewood Hotel and Spa over President's Day Weekend. We chose the hotel because of the reviews written and the Wedgewood Hotel and staff did not disapoint. We arrived a bit early but a suite was available and we were quickly checked in. The room was lovely and very comfortable with a large sofa/chaise combo in the living room that fit the two of us wonderfully. The bedroom had a very comfortable king bed with wonderful linens and pillows. There were little thoughtful touches such as a throw blanket, chocolates upon our arrival, bathrobes and slippers, ice bucket filled daily, nightly turn down service with cookies, etc.. Through out our stay we would find notes in our room thanking us for choosing the Wedgewood and letting us know if we needed anything from reservations at restaurants to recommendations for sight seeing to please let one of the staff know and they would arrange it for us. We did take advantage of the spa and LOVED it. We both had the exfoliation scrubs and then a 90 minute massages that were fabulous! The bar and restaurant were delightful. The bartender made great Ceasar's and the food was lovely; especially the Eggs Benedict. Additionally, the staff was wonderful. They always remembered us as we came and went and always had smiles for us and again asked us at every turn if needed anything or if they could assist us with anything. The only negative that we found was the drainage in the shower, very slow and the 4:00 am Monday morning wakeup by the trash pickup. Other than that we loved our stay and will return when we stay in Vancouver in the future. Review #94:Stayed here only 1 night on our way back from Whistler. We had to get up at 4am, so we went to bed early. We didn't hear another guest the entire time! The hotel is in an older building, however all of the rooms are very well appointed. There was even a bar in the room. Nice views of the city from our balcony (in a standard room). Valet is the only parking option, however it is much cheaper than some of the other hotels in the same area. (I think about $18 a day). Walking distance to quite a few things. The valet attendant was very friendly and willing to help. Would love to come back and stay longer than 1 night! Review #95:My husband and I checked into the hotel late in the evening. We were given a lovely suite, very well appointed on the 8th floor of the front side of the hotel and settled in for a 4 night stay. The first morning was quiet and we enjoyed our day in Vancouver. The hotel is near a nice market, movie theater, Robson street shopping and plenty of good restaurants. Unfortunately, the second morning, I awoke at 7am due to jackhammer noise along with the beep beep beep that construction equipment makes when backing up and general construction noise. There is a large construction project across the street from the hotel so be aware of that. When asked if we could move to something quieter, we were told they get complaints about garbage trucks coming at 5am at the back of the hotel but they would show us another room higher up on the front side. We tried the 11th floor, but the noise was not any better so checked out and went to another hotel down the street. To their credit, they did not penalize us for checking out early due to the problem with the noise. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are very nice, but I do wish they had told us about the construction. I would recommend this hotel to anyone once construction is complete so check first. My ratings of value and sleep quality are due entirely on the basis of the construction noise, otherwise they would have been higher. Review #96:So I went to the amazing Sara Bareilles concert in Vancouver and was fortunate to find this hotel on my iPhone via Google Maps! It was my first time and I will definitively go back! First Amazing thing: They upgraded me to a king suite! The room was awesome and the bed was unbelievable! Second Amazing Thing: The room had a big jacuzzi tub... Third Amazing Thing: The bed...OMG! Sunk in and had a tremendous sleep! Fourth Amazing Thing: WIthin minutes of arriving in my room they delivered a box of edible chocolates! Fifth Amazing Thing: The hotel is within walking distance to everything!! Sixth Amazing Thing: The staff were super friendly! Seventh Amazing Thing: The hotel has a warm and inviting feel.... Wow, I'm going back! Review #97:My wife and I were celebrating a special anniversary so we decided to go to the most talked about hotel in our city and we were certainly not disappointed. We had such a great weekend at the Wedgewood, that we've decided to make it a yearly tradition. The location is amazing, steps away from all the stores, restaurants and theatres and the service couldn't have been more professional and friendly at the same time. We stayed at a Wedgewood Suite beautifully decorated in cool brown and gold tones, silk fabrics and two luxurious spa bathrooms complete with pillar candles and bath salts for the double jetted tub - very romantic!! Breakfast in bed was wholesome and elegantly served, but their Spa was the highlight of our stay. We had to make reservations way in advance because it's so popular and we saw why. They offer a variety of interesting treatments, some for couples. a great eucalyptus steam room and the aestheticians were some of the best we've ever tried. My wife has already made a second appointment. Their Lounge and Restaurant, Bacchus is definitely the place to see and be seen by the elite of Vancouver. We had a great dinner the first evening and just dessert and drinks late the second evening. We will return often. Ken Clark Review #98:We stayed here at the start of our honeymoon in a Wedgewood suite which was fantastic. Nice and large and very comfortable. The room overlooked Robson Square and is only a few minutes walk to Robson street. Very friendly / helpful staff. The cookies at night were gorgeous and a nice touch as was the free net access to check weather / update on lost luggage etc... Jeff. Review #99:I discovered the Wedgewood here on TripAdvisor around three months ago and have since stayed there four times for a variety of reasons and with a different mix of rooms. This hotel has quickly become my preferred Hotel when I visit Vancouver, knocking Sutton Place, The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver and Hyatt out of my top preferred Hotels in the area. The location is perfect! With some of my favourite restaurants all around (The Bellagio or Cactus club for casual and quick, Don Francesco's for a Risotto, Starbucks or Tim's for Coffee...the list goes on!) and Pacific Centre, chapters, and other Robson street shopping just a block away. The Skytrain is your link to everything entertainment and is just a block in either direction. The staff is exceptional. Friendly, bright, chatty, helpful, and genuinely pleasant to talk to. Above all the staff at the Wedgewood is what makes this hotel so very different from others in the area. Most hotels you just want to get through the lobby and to your room with maybe the odd exception to the rule; here at the Wedgewood we find ourselves linger in the lobby to chat with the Valet, Concierge, or desk staff for a moment or two. When you return from an outing they want to know how it was? What did you find at the shops or how was the hockey game? With the Wedgewood I always feel like I'm visiting family, and the box of chocolates at check-in and nightly turn down service with a bottle of water and some cookies sure does help that along! If I could change one thing about the Wedgewood I would take two of their fabulous beds and make a two bedroom suite!", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The staff were really friendly and helpful with all our requests . The local area is fabulous with great food and drinks just yards away . Would definitely visit again. Review #1:We had a superior room that was beautifully decorated. The bathroom had a reasonable shower, although the screen didn't keep water from the floor. The service was excellent - they couldn't do enough to help (Reception/breakfast/night staff). It's in a quieter area, which was good, with easy access from/to the nearest Vaporetto (waterbus) stop (S.Stae - 5 mins walk), or walkable to Rialto etc. Print a detailed map for arrival - without one it's not that easy to find! Would definitely recommend this hotel, and use it again. Review #2:We stayed at this hotel for one week. The hotel staff at the reception (Carlo & Christina) were more than willing to help us enjoy our visit to Venice. Apparently the building was originally built in the 15th century and was just renovated this year (2010). Our room was spacious and very clean, and our bed was quite comfortable. It is one stop vaporetto ride from the train station. Breakfast was simple but sufficient. MLOttawa Review #3:Booked after reading Tripadvisor reviews. This hotel has the \"wow\" factor. It is beautifully decorated and is immaculately clean. The location is so quiet that a good night's sleep is easy . Staff were very warm and welcoming. Our deal had free internet and breakfast - excellent. We were not at all surprised to see the Tripadvisor award on the reception desk. The hotel has not been opened long, but they could give lessons to some on the meaning of \"hospitality\". We caught the Alilaguna ferry from the airport to \"Guglie\". We did not see one Traghetto the whole time we were there - there is a crossing near the hotel. For this reason we walked from the ferry stop. When we arrived at the Scalzi bridge (near the railway station) we just had to follow the mustard coloured signs painted high on the walls to the hotel. The first we saw when were atop the Scalzi bridge - look at the wall in front of you and the sign is to the right of the street. Follow the arrows to MUSEU CIVICO di STORIA, Fontego dei Turchi and you will find yourself at the hotel. Look for the red banner. Once there, you will not be disappointed. Congratulations to everyone at the hotel for making our stay in magnificent Venice so memorable! Review #4:As pictured on the internet, the \"red room\" is a true indication of spaciousness. Huge and luxurious bedroom and bathroom (both very clean), with deep bath and good water pressure on the shower! Room bright when needed, and dark when necessary. Quiet location, away from the hustle and bustle. Easy to find as it is next to the Natural History Museum. Vaporetto stop on Riva di Biasio approximately 250m from hotel and only one stop from Ferrovia train station. Majer bakery on Calle Larga 100m from hotel - cheap, delicious food, friendly staff. La Zucca, scrumptious vegetarian food approximately 100m from hotel. Fair distance from major sights, though vaporetti are useful for getting around. Breakfast not served until 8am, which is not helpful if you would like an early start to your sightseeing day. Review #5:The room was sensational, the staff absolutely wonderful. It was within walking distance to everything. Close to a ferry station and had great little restaurants nearby. It is slightly away from the mad tourist central, thank goodness. I am definitely going back. We were celebrating my sisters 50th birthday and the staff sent us to a lovely restaurant, I felt safe and secure everywhere and the hotel certainly helped. It is a little hard to find, but if you pay attention to the directions,its not hard. Review #6:We stayed for 2 nights in a room for 4. It was cosy but very comfortable in a newly refurbished room. The bathroom was spacious and well accomodated. Staff were friendly. An adequate breakfast was included. The area is quite but only 2 minutes away from a campo with a patisserie, supermarkets and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel in this fantastic city. Review #7:Just spent the weekend in Venice with my now fiancee and stayed at this hotel. The staff helped me to find a brilliant resturuant (Bistro De Venise), organized flowers and champagne for our room and took care of a gondola booking. They were friendly, attentive and generally amazing. The supreme room I booked was great, the bed super comfortable and the bathrooms very good! The hotel is not that hard to find from the \"Riva de Basio\" stop on the Grand Canal, at most its a 10 min walk. Staying here made our special weekend away even more special. Highly reccommended!! *Only fault I can think of is my MacBook didn't work with internet in the room, something to do with Bootcamp and their firewall software. But they have a laptop in reception where you can access the internet. Review #8:Location, location, location is also important for hotels! This hotel offers very spacey rooms ( unlike most in Venice) and is situated only 2 minutes walk from the hussle and bussle of the Rialto part of Venice, but at the same time situated in a very calm and relaxed area. In other words: the nights are quiet, but access to the high life is instant. On top of that, this hotel offers very spacey rooms in the classic Venezian style. Service is superb, good knowleable staff with a wonderful command of the English language. Tremendous service, good solid breakfast, wireless internet and very good coffee. What more does one want? One tip: to reach the hotel from the parking, you can walk or take the waterbus. Don't consider walking!! Take the waterbus. 6 euro p.p but well spent money. This hotel will go onto my shortlist and when I'm in Venice, I will stay here. No question about it. Review #9:This small, friendly and beautifully appointed hotel proved to be a marvellous base for a relaxing long weekend of fun, great food and hours and hours of incredible sightseeing in the magical city of Venice! Situated almost on the banks of the Grand Canal adjacent to the National History Museum (follow the signs if youever feel lost) this 22 room hotel is really special. The service at the hotel Reception Desk and in the breakfast room is polite, professional, knowlegeable and friendly at all times. The bedrooms are spotlessly clean, spacious and elegantly furnished - even to the extent of having fine glass chandeliers. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Review #10:Elegant, warm, excellent service - we were more than pleased with this hotel. The rooms were beautiful (we had a cream and gold decorated room), comfortable bed, excellent bath room, breakfast was lovely, internet in room (LAN not wireless, but it was good service). Please note, the hotel is set approximately 20-30 minutes walk from St. Mark's but that was fine with us! It allowed us to 'wander' the walkways and get a real feel for Venice. Walking to the Rialto and the fish market was a delight. Caterina and her staff are most gracious, very helpful with maps and suggestions. It is approximately 20-25 minutes walk from the train station. Note: we brought our GPS and were grateful for it as when we arrived, we promptly were lost! But it brought us directly to the hotel. If you use a GPS, note that you must set it for walking or stop frequently to update your exact position. Also, if you are walking, keep your luggage to a minimum. There are many many bridges with steps that may prove too daunting for some with luggage. Review #11:spent 3 night there a few days ago. went with a friend for a birthday get away. booked hotel after looking at the reviews and were not disappointed.Slightly off the beaten track but that\"s what we liked. As you walk everywhere it really makes no difference anyway and it was quiet and very real venice. 5 mins to station 15 or so to Rialto.Very good bar 1 mins walk away where the locals go and a great trattoria again 1 min. walk with fab. venezian food very well done. I lived in Italy for 20years so I have a pretty good idea. we ate there every night. it\"s called La trattoria al ponte. Staff all very helpful all the time and we had tea and coffee in our room - to get us up - for a small charge.Rooms clean comfortable nicely decorated, all new. we were given maps and they helped with directions. I was looking for a paritcular shop and they googled it for me and wrote down the address, all with great friendliness. would tell my friends. Gilly sussex Review #12:It's not a bad hotel, but there's no way this is the 11th best hotel in Venice (according to TripAdvisor's current rankings). Our room was one of two on the top floor, which sadly the elevator doesn't go to. Being on the top floor also means a slanted roof that can be a tad tight for tall people (especially the shower). There were also no windows in the room -- just two skylights that were obviously installed so they could legally rent out the room at full price. (Note: a skylight might sound nice, but unless you like looking clouds, there isn't much of a view). The complimentary breakfast was nice, too, just be aware that if like your eggs any way but hard-boiled, it's not quite so complimentary anymore. Now, Venice is a small city where everything is within walking distance, therefore every hotel in Venice has a good location, but the location needs to be mentioned nonetheless. It's a quiet neighborhood, which is great during the day if you hate crowds, but at night, the lack of foot traffic was actually a little unsettling, especially on our first couple nights, before we learned our way around. The walk back to the hotel goes through many very dark, very cramped, and very disorientating alleyways. I'm sure Venice is a very safe city, but it's still a city. Next time we're in Venice, we going to try staying somewhere closer to the busy spots. All that said, it's close to the train station, so that was nice. Again, we didn't hate the place, but the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor (and the lofty ranking) definitely boosted our expectations a little too high. Oh, and it should also probably be noted that our room looked nothing like any of the pictures. Review #13:This room was beautiful. It looked just like the professional photos, was very clean, and had a great bathroom... with a very deep tub. We found it easily enough (follow the instructions on the website!) and the service was very good. The breakfast was AMAZING, especially for italy. I kept expecting them to charge us for it. You have to leave the room key with the front desk when you all leave but really its for the best. Its kind of far from the super touristy sites but nothing is really that far in Venice and it feels nice to be a little more isolated. It is very close to the main entrance to the island so that is very convient. And the neighborhood is good. It was by far the most expensive hotel we stayed at in Italy but we found that everything is more expensive in Venice compared with the rest of Italy.... and when we were looking we found that in Venice you either stay somewhere nice or somewhere bad... not a lot of middle ground. At least with this place you will be happy with what you get for your money. Review #14:Very convenient to train station, off the beaten path quiet area, room were great, reception staff was very helpful and nice. Location was great for us, about 20 minute walk to San Marco, 10 minutes to Rialto bridge. Overall very nice experience to end honeymoon trip to Italy on. Review #15:This fantastic little hotel is the perfect place to stay for a romantic getaway that is away from many of the tourist areas. While you might get a little lost trying to find it, but get use to that experience in Venice, it's not difficult to find the hotel. There is a friendly and helpful staff waiting for you. We stayed in a superior golden room on the ground floor and even though it is behind the lobby it is still a quiet stay. The room is large with a typical Italian bed, slightly harder then most but still comfortable, and a large bathroom which is set up for people with special needs. The breakfast was a cold breakfast with plenty of options to eat in morning. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay here again on my next visit to Venice. Review #16:If you want a five star experience in a three star hotel, go there. Fantastic staff, high class materials in classic design, the hotel situated in a calm area away from the busy parts of the city but still in comfortable walking distance to everything. Review #17:My girlfriend and I had booked this hotel for 2 nights and arrived about Midday. We found the hotel easily following signs for the History Museum. On arrival our room was ready, having booked a Superior room - our expectations were high (judging by reviews and photos!). We were led to a ground floor room which was - literally - next to the reception and lift. The room was customised in traditional Venesian decor, and was spotless. On entering the bathroom it was clear the room is designed for a disabled guest with pull cords, seat in the shower, no bath and adjusted toilet fittings. Despite this we were happy with our room although it was slightly smaller than we imagined. The hotel is situated in a lovely, quaint neighbourhood outside of the busy St Mark's area which is VERY touristy. We spent many an hour wandering the beautiful streets near to the hotel and sitting by the canals. There are several nice restaurants and cafe's nearby to waste the day. Breakfast at the hotel is adequate, although hot food is at an additional charge, so pastries, cereals etc available. Rooms are air conditioned and equipped with free safety deposit box, mini bar, free wifi but no tea or coffee facilities or room in the fridge for water etc. Hotel staff friendly, advised us on main sights and Gondola rides. This hotel is not cheap, but just what we were after. Would definitely visit again. Review #18:Stayed here for 1 night on a romantic break with my boyfriend, we got upgraded to a superior room which was huge all decked out in red drapes and gold mirrors. Staff very really friendly and helpful and had the best nights sleep in ages. Would definitely recommend this hotel Review #19:We loved the location and the fact that you can follow the \"street\" signs to the Museum of Natural History if you prefer walking to water transportation. It's away from the hustle and bustle of tourist areas and especially convenient if you need to be near the train station (about a 10 minute walk). There's a wonderful neighborhood piazza (San Giacomo) just around the corner that gave us easy access to gelato, pastries, sandwiches and restaurants. The hotel itself is lovely and well-maintained with comfortable rooms; breakfast was the standard European variety and well done. Michele and Caterina are extremely helpful and friendly. This was our favorite hotel during our travels by far! Review #20:This hotel grew on me. It is not luxurious, but it is certainly comfortable, even cozy. It is in a quiet neighborhood but close to water transportation and some lovely restaurants and shops. The woman at the desk during the day was an exceptionally comptetent and courteous person. You can't help but like her. The hotel is safe, clean, reasonable priced and user friendly. I would return and also recommend to others. Review #21:not the easiest place to fine, even in Venice. If you arrive after dark, you had better have a very good idea of how to find this spot, even if you have been to Venice. Rooms very small, prices are fair and you do get breakfast. I dont think I would stay there again. Staff was very helpfull however. Not a bad experience, just too many choices in the world today and would go somewhere else. Location is very centralized however. Review #22:Stayed 2 nights after getting off a cruise in Venice. Charming hotel that has only been open a year with 14 rooms. Our room was very large with a lovely bathroom. WIFI and continental breakfast was included. Michelle at the front desk always had a smile on her face and was very helpful with directions and our luggage when we arrived. Although we arrived early and our room was not yet ready, we were able to leave our luggage and go off touring. Handy location for the water bus stop and close to a local square that had a grocery store and several restaurants. Review #23:This hotel should be 5 star. It made our trip all the more special... The decor and cleanliness of the room was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly. They couldnt do enough for you.. The breakfast was very nice, even though there wasn't a huge selection, there was enough choice to suit everyone. I would definatly recommend this hotel, and if I were to go back to venice would definatly stay here. Added extras were that they provided you with a detailed map on your arrival, pointing out all the must see places, recommended resturants (although we didn't try them) and there is free internet access in the hotel with a pass code they provide you with at reception. Review #24:This was a lovely hotel in an excellent location - a quiet little road, but walkable to the train station and all the sights of Venice. It is only a 3-star hotel, but possible the nicest 3-star hotel we've ever stayed in. Very large room, decorated in a wonderfully over-the-top, Italian style. Breakfast is adequate - fruit, cereal, bread, ham/cheese, basic cake/pastries. There are hot options available for an extra charge. Efficient, friendly service from the front desk. This hotel was good value, when you consider that Venice is an expensive city. Review #25:As others have said - lovely little hotel, gorgeous, comfortable rooms. Breakfast small but adequate. Conveniently located in Santa Croce, which is close to the train station while still being fairly close to San Marco/Rialto without too much hustle-and-bustle. Warnings: owner/manager, though nice, does try to steer you in a much more expensive direction than you might be expecting, recommending very expensive/touristy restaurant in San Marco (which, once I actually checked the place out, did not seem to be as good as the more local/authentic restaurants nearby in Santa Croce), also trying to sell little ceramic things to us from the hotel lobby (at inflated prices). So all in all, as long as you graciously decline all the recommendations and go with Tripadvisor or just your gut by walking around, you'll love this place. It's gorgeous, it's a good value, and well-located. Review #26:This medium sized hotel, a former Dukes Palace or Merchant house, is just behind the Natural History Museum in Venice, about two stops along the grand canal form the railway station. It is close to a little square where local families and tourists both eat and mingle in the evening, which was something I didn't expect to see in Venice, and very much added to the character of our visit. The hotel was spotless, recently refurbished with limestone scrolled details retained within the pristine modern bathroom, and the decor in the room was opulent with silks, venetian glass, and chenilles everywhere - which didn't seem contrived at all given the setting. The breakfast room was small, and the choice at breakfast was limited, but otherwise, this hotel was perfect. Review #27:We spent the 1st 3 nights of our Italian honeymoon here and had a fantastic time. Slightly difficult to find as you have to navigate down a couple of narrow lanes before it opens up to a wider street. Not far from San Stae vaporetto stop.We arrived at night too, so was much easier to locate in the daylight! Welcoming reception staff who showed us our room which was right behind reception. A fairly big room by Venice standard and beautifully decorated. Great big bathroom although i think our room catered for disabled visitors with more of a wet room shower and disabled toilet facilities. Our room was right at the front entrance to the hotel, and even though it was off season, the location of the hotel on a quiet street gave a great undisturbed sleep. the breakfast facilities were good with friendly helpful staff offering fresh made cappuccinos. After hours of sightseeing, it was great to head back to the hotel, and continue to the end of the street, where we would sit on the Grand Canal and watch the continual buzz of Venice life. loved it, and would definately return. Review #28:Hotel is ok for the price. It's a place to sleep and have some breakfast. Location is ok. 10-15 min walk from piazzale roma if you don't get lost. Whereever you go in venice you will get lost. Take vaporetto to Riva del Biasio or the next stop. Once you have the hotel's map, it makes things easier. Our room was small. We had a window. The bathroom had a shower in the corner with a curtain. No tub. Breakfast was ok. Nothing special in my opinion. The hotel is about 10 min walk to Rialto market. About double or so to San Marco. The traghetto across to the Ghetto area was never operating so don't rely on it on your map. Overall, we loved Venice but not because of the hotel. Review #29:We arrived in Venice and reached the hotel (through flooded street) safely. The hotel was not big from its external appearance but fantastic once we were inside: warm welcome by hotel staff, great room arrangement, spontaneous tour guide and above all the surrounding was so quiet! We were allocated rooms at the top level. There were only TWO rooms there. And they were superb! The hotel is far better than what we perceived on the photos, and deserve to be promoted better. It is not close from the hotspots for tourists. But being a small city, it took us less than 30 minutes to reach Piazza San Marco. And along the way, there were so many small boutiques which were so unique to Venice, so no time lost. All in all, please book your next stay in Venice with this hotel. Review #30:One of the highlights of our trip to Italy was the Al Duca Hotel and their staff...all were very pleasent and so helpful with any request we had, especially the breakfast staff. I would highly recommand this hotel when visiting Venice, even if it is hard to find.... Review #31:We had a great stay at this lovely little hotel. It's only small but it's full of charm and character and very easy to find being the first stop off the water taxi - directly out of the train station. We were greeted by very friendly staff and offered a glass of Prosecco before being shown to our room which was a very nice touch. Our room was one of the \"red\" ones and had a comfy bed and our only disappointment was that it didn't have a bath but because there was so much to do in a short time this wasn't a huge problem as showering was quicker! The walk into the main area of Venice was very pleasant and we took a different route in and back each time, never finding the same alleyways and lots of photo opportunites. I fell in love with Venice and want to go back and would stay at the same hotel as it was nice to have the walk in and out each day which only took 15 minutes to get to St Marks Square, if that. Yes, Venice is expensive but there are places to eat that are off the beaten track that are well worth the visit as we found the food in the main areas to be expensive and just not worth the money - drinks in St Marks Square are very expensive so avoid at all costs - it's just not worth it as you can soak up the atmosphere just as nicely by sitting on the side and taking it all in and then find yourself a place to eat that will be worth the money a little away from the main hubbub! Review #32:Lovely quaint hotel in a peaceful part of city next to Venetian Museum of Natural History (Museo di Storia Naturale). 15 mins walk from Ferrovia (railway station). Recommend taking Vaporetta (water bus) Route 1 to Riva de Biasio stop for those with luggage in tow. Warmly received by exceptionally friendly reception staff who spoke good english, armed with ready smile to greet render assistance on directions, food, places of visits etc. Room was clean, beautifully decorated Venezian style. Exceededed expectations for 3* hotel. Has free wi-fi, in-room safe and delicious continental breakfast (variety of food not great but sufficient). Airconditioning worked flawlessly - a good respite from scorching summer heat. Location is not near major Venice attractions but reachable via Vaporetta or walking as Venice is a relatively small city. Review #33:My husband and I stayed here for the first stop of our Italian Honeymoon. We had the \"Red Room\" which was very authentic and romantic. Great location, great room, great service...great choice! The breakfast was yummy and included fresh cappuccino. The hotel recommended 2 restaurants: Ca'Leon which we LOVED and Bistrot de Venise which was good but a bit over priced. All in all a wonderful hotel and a perfect trip to Venice. Review #34:Though we got off to a little bit of a rocky start (our VISA credit card did not work abroad for some reason, & they tried contacting us several times, but gmail automatically put all of their emails into a spam folder - didn't even know it existed! ), we ended up having a great stay here in Venice. We loved the location & the manager there was wonderful. Also, the breakfast was top notch, I definitely had the best cappuccino of our stay at this hotel. And the dramatic, incredibly romantic rooms couldn't have been beat for the first nights of our honeymoon. There is no view of the canal, true, but we didn't miss it - you're on or next to the water all day. Even the water taxi is beautiful & thrilling. One of the people at the desk wasn't particularly friendly, he seemed annoyed to help my husband with his phone, but otherwise everyone was very friendly! Oh, and it was great having a computer free to use in the lobby. Thank you! Review #35:Due to our own stupid mistake, we showed up at this hotel one day before our reservation. The staff were so accomodating. They put us into a spare room (which was amazing) and took great care of us. This hotel is in a great location. It is not right on top of the main tourist haunts so it gives you a chance to explore different lane ways every time you venture out. The breakfasts were great and staff were always on hand to help. We opted to book a room with an external bathroom. This unfortunatley was actually up on another level and through a canvas covered walkway on the roof - which was not the greatest seeing as it was winter, but all in all, we would go back to Al Duca di Venezia if we have the good fortune to return to Venice. Review #36:We chose this hotel based on the reviews of other guests. We were not disappointed! The hotel is easy to find if you take the directions given on the hotel website. The hotel is situated in a very quiet part of the town which becomes a very welcome change from the crowds in the other parts of Venice. It is about 15 minutes walk to the Rialto Bridge and another 10 minutes onto St Marks Square. We were given a Superior room at the front of the hotel which was tastefully decorated in cream and gold and made to resemble a vintage style. The breakfast was adequate but became a bit monotonous after a couple of days. The service was great and the reception staff were very willing to give recommendations for sight seeing and where to eat. Eating by the major sights in Venice can prove to be very expensive. We found some great restaurants by the hotel which served great food and had a more local atmosphere. We would recommend La Zucca ( you have to book beforehand for both evening meal and lunch) and Capitan Uncino. Both are very close to the Hotel. We would definitely recommend staying here and can't wait to go back! Review #37:Just returned from our italian journey celebrating our 10 yr anniversary. Had the pleasure of staying six nights - three nights to begin our trip and three nights to end. The overall hotel experience was outstanding. Despite getting one of the smaller superior rooms upon arrival we were surprised with a beautiful and spacious superior room when we returned, although we reserved a classic room. The hotel is beautifully restored palace. The renovations and finishes are top of the line. The staff was kind, helpful and accomodating (this is not a given when travelling in Italy). The breakfast was typical, but we really enjoyed the freshly baked brioche. This was our third trip to Venice. When we return we will be staying at this hotel. There is no better value in Venice! Review #38:Good location in the quieter, residential part of Venice. Follow the directions on the website and you can't go wrong. Very appealing reception and very helpful staff on reception. Be prepared for a detailed explanation on why you will have to pay 3 Euros per person, per night and why it has to be paid in cash only. Very interesting! The room we had was a superior on the first floor opposite the gorgeous red rooms. It was beautifully decorated in the Venetian style. There was a safe and TV. En suite was excellent with a selection of toiletries. The bed was divine. Very comfortable. All in all, very good. Breakfasts are very good with good coffee made to order, fresh pastries, cake, biscotti etc. La Duca is an excellent base for exploring Venice and the hotel provides maps and will help you with directions and general help. I needed a pharmacy and the directions given to me helped me find it very quickly when otherwise it might have taken me ages. There are some excellent places to eat nearby and if you look around, some of them are fairly reasonably priced. If you can speak any Italian, it will go a long way with the Venetians. They appreciate you trying. They are very friendly and love a laugh and joke. If you've never been to Venice and are thinking about going. What are you waiting for? Go! Stay at this hotel and you can't go wrong. It's away from the crazy tourist hustle and bustle and you'll be glad of the peace and quiet after a day of sightseeing. If there was a minus point, it was that there was no room service (and if there was, we were not made aware of it) and no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. I know that this is the norm in Italy but it makes this hotel a good Bed and Breakfast when it is just a step away from being a wonderful hotel. Review #39:This is a small, lovely, cozy hotel opened in March 2010. The staff, lead by Caterina - the hotel manager - is very pleasant and competent. Reservations were easy to be done through email, Carlo and Pratik answered all the infos we needed. We travelled with our teen age son and stayed in room 101. The hotel has an elevator for carrying up the lugage. The room was spacious, very nice decorated in Venezian style, exactly as shown in the hotel website. Nice and clean bathroom. From our room we could see the street and the Museum of Natural History The location was close to all the main tourist attractions in a nice and peaceful neighborhood. Our rate included continental breakfast which was delicious. Wireless internet was included in the rate and worked with no problems. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would certainly stay there again on our next visit Review #40:I could not have been more pleased with Hotel Al Duca. The hotel is small, and located about 100 feet from the Grand Canal, and is easily reached from the airport ( I splurged with a private water taxi ). As my luggage did not arrive, I cannot say enough good things about the staff. Michelle, at the front desk, was incredible! She helped me to try and track down my bag, and as we worked two phones for 2 hours, she was professional and very sweet! The hotel was clean and had a nice breakfast.....my room had a deep and fab bathtub....but the location was just FANTASTIC! I easily walked to the Rialto Market and then to San Marco Piazza.....but I stayed in the lovely square just a two minute walk from the hotel in the evenings. There was a cafe with wines, a wonderful restaurant with delicious pizza, and the best people watching. The square was full of families in the early evening, children running off energy, moms watching, older people strolling arm in arm. There is also a \"supermarket\" in the square, perfect for nibbles and a bottle of wine....Do NOT miss the little bakery you will pass on your walk from the hotel, it's on the left right before the square......the most delicious \"Italian\" style cannoli! Review #41:We arrived in Venice by train, a bit hard to maneuver our suitcases over the cobbled paths, up the stairs and over the bridge... But when we arrived 10 mins later at Al Duca di Venezia it was WELL worth the walk! We got to the hotel and found out we were upgraded! The room was absolutely beautiful. The best hotel we stayed in while we traveled around Italy. The staff were super friendly and helpful! They gave us advice about food, shopping and sight seeing - with a very handy map included! Would recommend this place to absolutely everyone!!!! ! Review #42:Hotel Al Duca is a wonderful small bed and breakfast located in a very quiet neighborhood in the Santa Croce district. The hotel is well appointed and the rooms although small are beautifully decorated with lavishly colored wallpaper, draperies and bedspreads. The Murano glass chandelier in our room was a true work of art. Continental breakfast was served every morning with warm croissants, bagels, a selection of cold cut meats and cheese, fresh fruit and juices.Just a short walk to nearby vaporetto stops makes getting aroud Venice a breeze. The staff was attentive and very helpful with suggestions for sightseeing and recommended restaurants nearby. Overall a very good value for the moderate room rate. Review #43:My wife and I stayed 3 nights in October 2011 for our honeymoon and were amazed by the beauty of the rooms. The hotel is located within a 5 minute walking distance from the Vaporetto and you can make the trip to from the car parking / bus stations within 15. When we arrived, we found out that our room had a water plumbing problem so we had to stay in a temporary B&B apartment nearby. While we were a bit disappointed (especially since it was our honeymoon) we were not notified earlier of the situation, Catherine (the general manager) made the right amends the next day by upgrading our room for the last two nights and forgoing payment on the first night. It was a very nice gesture that really makes you feel like the staff cares about its guests. The rooms themselves are as beautiful as they look in the photographs. For any honeymooners, the red rooms were absolutely romantic and the way to go. Overall, great location, friendly and caring staff, and beautiful rooms. Review #44:Everything about this hotel was brilliant. I loved this hotel. It's the perfect place for a romantic getaway. The room, esp. the red superior room was stupendous. I will go back there for sure. P.S - If you're loaded, then go by the hotel staff's recommendations for places to eat, visit, etc. If you're not, then do your own homework cause their recommendations all but drove me to poverty :) Review #45:My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights in October 2011. We arrived by train around noon, and it only took us about 12 or so minutes to walk to the hotel from the station carrying all of our bags. The directions they gave were easy to follow, however I imagine that it could be difficult to find for the first time in the evening. Our room was the only room without an in-room bathroom - when booking this was not a problem for us. We were surprised by how large this room actually was. You have to take the steps to go to the private bathroom, which again was no problem and made clear when booking. However, you technically have to go outside on the roof to get to the bathroom. This was a little unexpected. They have some white tarps arranged in a way to make a hallway, but there is no mistaking that you are on a roof. Also, there is no external lock on the bathroom to guarantee that no one wanders in. You can lock the bathroom once you are inside, but for me, this seems like a security issue. Not to mention, since we were told that the room was private we left a few bathroom items in there (face wash, loofah and conditioner) - only to find out that they had been thrown away. Luckily this was at the end of our trip, or it would have been a little more of an issue. Other than this, the bathroom itself was very nice. The hotel staff was friendly and their breakfast was great. If it wasn't for the minor bathroom issue (throwing away our stuff) and the safety concerns, I would have given the hotel a 5 rating. Review #46:Me and my wife stayed in Al Duca di Venezia for 5 nights. We had a superior double room. Hotel is located in a quite place, but short walking distance from Rialto anf from Piazzale Roma. Room was great. A big room (much bigger than what you typically get in euroean hotels), very nicely decorated, and very nice bathroom. Everything is new and looks very nice and clean. Breakfast was typical (you can order any type of eggs for extra cost). Hotel manager (I think that her name is Caterina) was so nice and helpfull. She gave us very good advices, and was very very friendly. We will come again Review #47:My Mother and I had an amazing time!! The service was very good!! The manager, Catherina was very nice and helpful. We stayed in a room with external bathroom but it was not a problem at all!! We strong recommend Al Duca Di Venezia hotel for you next trip to Venice! ! Review #48:I had booked 2 nights at this hotel via booking.com, however could not make it to Venice on time due to Italian transportation strike, I informed booking.com about my predicament and rightfuly so changed my booking to only 1 night. As a courtesy I informed the hotel about the change and was told insistingly that I will have to pay the full 2 nights which I believe was unfair so I cancelled my booking altogether via booking.com. I was quite distraught to find out when I was back that the hotel charged me full 2 nights despite me not even having spent 1 night at the hotel. Review #49:We stayed in the Al Duca Hotel for four nights, and really enjoyed our stay. Location: Although not located in the touristy centre (more relaxed and quiet! ), Venice is very small and you can walk from the hotel to all the hotspots in about 10 minutes. Rooms: The hotel is expectionally well build and decorated - I have seldomly seen such eye for detail. The rooms are really 'Venetian styled' (the cheaper ones are a bit small though, but that is inherent to Venice I guess). Service: the people at reception are really very kind and truly genuine. All in all, I can really recommend this place. Review #50:We stayed here for three nights in July and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms are alot smaller then I thought, but beautifully decorated and well looked after. The bed was a little hard for my liking but still managed to sleep ok after a long day in Venice. Breakfast was sufficient but the simply addition of a toaster would help, I don't drink coffee but it did look really good!. In room facilities are great like the free safe, Wifi and hair dryer all good touches. Location is fantastic, not to far from the attractions and easy enough to find from the airport. Staff are very friendly and helpful and the price we paid was pretty good for the standard and location of the hotel. We would recommend and return to this hotel if we returned to Venice. Review #51:We were disappointed in Venice overall and rejoiced that vicissitudes reduced our visit from two days to one--it's smelly, congested, and overpriced, and most of the shops sell Carnival kitsch and other such merchandise. The Casino is pretty vulgar. But this hotel stands out for us as the best part of our visit--secluded, very friendly, over-the-top decor, nice breakfast, plenty of advice and assistance (especially from Caterina and her son). And we remain grateful for such an oasis in a desert of taste. Review #52:We stayed at Al Duca the beginning of November 2011. It is the best 3 star hotel we've stayed at in Venice. Our Superior room was 102 and it is a very, very red room (photos are on their website), large for European standards, high ceilings, with a step up to the beige/tan marble bathroom. The bed was a little hard for me but my husband loved it. Our child slept on a roll-away that they loved because it was so comfortable. Bathroom was very clean. Free use of lobby computer with free printing of boarding passes was a wonderful addition. The lift/elevator is very small. This hotel is in a quiet section (San Crose) away from the chaos of Pizza San Marco (St. Mark's Square). .It is located about a 15 minute stroll including about 6 small bridges from Rialto bridge The hotel is tricky to find, especially at midnight, so if you have GPS bring it and use it. The Hotel is between the San Biascio and S. Stae vaporetto stops and really does back up to the Natural History Museum.Bring a detailed map and folowwing the signs on the sides of the walls and sometimes on the pavement can direct in what direction you need to go, Station = toward P. Roma, or Rialto = toward the bridge and tourist town The church at the S.Stae vaporetto stop is impressive. Typical continental breakfast but the coffee and hot chocolate were wonderful. No pan au chocolat for the kid but the multigrain/nut roll with sunflower seeds is good (usually found with pistachio) and cooked eggs are offered for extra. There is some noise, not too bad, in the mornings from people going up and down the stairs to the breakfast areas. Review #53:We stayed at this hotel having booked two superior rooms. It is quite close to the Piazzza Roma and railway station. We found our way easily to the hotel having got instructions from their web site and checked on Google maps. The area of the hotel is fairly quiet and has a local feel. If is not far to walk to the main atractions (Venice is a small place which can easily be covered on foot by anyone of reasonable fitness). The hotel is smart and clean and the bedrooms exceptionally nice. The public areas are small but adiquate. The staff were very friendly and helpful, going out of their way to try to make the best of our stay. Breakfast was a good continental with planty of choice. Cooked food was extra but not really required so we didn't bother with that. On the down side a garden or terrace would be nice to site out in, but we knew they didn't have one when we booked so weren't didapointed. Hotels with these facilities appear to be very expensive in Venice as open space is at a premium in this city. The hotel was expensive however everything in Venice appears expensive so don't be put off by the price. Overall this was a very nice hotel with very good room standards. Location we found excellent, allowing us easy access to the busier parts of the city but a quiet retreat at night and in the evening. Review #54:The hotel was a bit hard to find on foot after the boat from the airport dropped us off at the vaporetti stop of San Stae. However, when we finally found the hotel, it turned out to be within an easy 5 minute walk of the vaporetti stop. It has large, clean, extravagantly decorated rooms. The people at the front desk were helpful but beware of being steered by them to overpriced tourist restaurants. Breakfast is adequate but is served in stuffy rooms. The location near two vaporetti stops makes it easy to access many of the major attractions. Review #55:We absolutely were pleased with our room. We had the Classic Room. (Gold) Bathroom- The cleanest, spacious, with stand up shower, fan and nice window and hair dryer was a plus. Bedroom- LOVED LOVED LOVED the bed! I booked this room because of their beds and cleanliness. I don't stay in hotels with hard smelly beds.. This bed was so comfortable that we had the best sleep EVER! Loved the decor and colors- i took pictures of the bed, i loved the headboard!!! Nice big windows- air the room out!! Overall the room- Smelled good, clean, enough room for two, comfortable clean beds, free WIFI with code at front desk- has anything you need! Free breakfast! Proximity to Rialto, Train- We WALKED everywhere!! It is close to everything. About 5 minutes from the Rialto Bridge. It is very close to the train but we had to take a water taxi to our hotel. That was the only time we took public transportation. Breakfast- European breakfast. We had a few pastries and cappuccino. We ate cereal and fruit. Save the calories for dinner! ! Review #56:We found the hotel easily after getting off the water taxi, it was very lovely. Very clean, very helpful staff and I would definately stay there again. The only thing that would have made it better was if it was slightly cheaper, but you get what you pay for. Great hotel would absolutely recommend this one if you can afford it. Review #57:This hotel is a delight--absolutely gorgeous. My room was shades of cream and gold. Rich but not overpowering. It was a good size with a large bed and a large closet. I looked out on a little courtyard. The bathroom was marble with a bidet and heated rails for the towels which were in the same colors as the rest of the room. Everything was immaculate and in excellent condition. Breakfast was fine and the service was impeccable.The staff went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable and it really was an outstanding experience. Molto bene! Review #58:We made our reservation 6 months in advance, based on the TA reviews, and are glad we did. The hotel is new/newly renovated, with beautiful decor, marble bathrooms, elegant linens and Venetian chandeliers in all of the rooms. The location was excellent for us - near a vaporetto stop and the train station, in a quiet area of Santa Croce not too near the San Marco tourist mayhem. The hotel staff accommodated without a fuss a special request we made (our daughters weren't comfortable sleeping in the same king size bed, so the hotel re-made the bed as two single beds). We arrived at the hotel before check-in time, but they held our bags and had moved them to our room by the time we returned from a walk in Venice. The free wifi worked great in our 2nd floor (European 1st floor) room. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking an elegant stay and attentive service in Venice. Review #59:We stayed in Venice in early September, for the first time, as part of our Silver Wedding Anniversary holiday. The hotel is in a perfect location, just two stops on the water bus, then a short walk. All the staff at the hotel made us very welcome, the service was exceptional. We stayed in a \"red room\", overlooking the museum at the side, and it was very luxurious, comfortable and very quiet. Breakfast was very good. For us, the location was the key, as it is away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy St Marks etc. but close-by is a lovely square with some excellent restaurants, supermarket, etc. Everywhere is very accessible from the hotel, we walked everywhere, you can walk very easily to the busy tourist places if you want to but then have the lovely option to go back to the quieter area of the Al Duca. A memorable place to stay in Venice. Review #60:I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault anything about this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the staff are friendly and helpful; the room (101) is dramatically decorated, clean, comfortable and very quiet, with a nice view of the museum next door; the breakfast is fine and plentiful; and the location is great if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be in the middle of all the hub-bub but do want easy access to everywhere. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 30 seconds from San Stae vaporetto stop, just straight up the road, which is handy for the airport (we got one of those semi-private water taxi thingys, not sure what they call them but it dropped us right at San Stae stop) and for everywhere else. About one minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s walk away is a nice little square with a few restaurants and bars on it where you can watch the locals go about their daily lives. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to use the vaporetto it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also easy to walk everywhere else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even if a particular area is a little bit far away, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to take \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphotos of along the way, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a hassle! \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 I would definitely stay here again. I am just so happy to find a hotel where there is nothing to disappoint! \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 Review #61:My husband and I have just been to this most beautiful little hidden treasure of a hotel for the 3rd time in 13 months. We`ve celebrated a wedding anniversary and my birthday there...its just that sort of stunning secret place you want to go to when you`ve got something (anything) to celebrate. The staff are always extremely friendly, and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms, well the one room we`ve stayed in each time (201), and others we`ve poked our head into when the doors have been ajar, are so sumptuous and nicely spacious. Everything is spotlessly clean..someone mentioned rusty mirrors...thats the antique finish effect sweetie !!! The only thing we find lets it down just a very small tad is that the breakfast isn`t particularly inspiring, or much of a choice. This just means you get to stop off for a little extra something on the walk thru the mesmerising little alleyways into town !!! I`m actually quite sad we`ve got other things planned for the next year, and won`t be going back there for a while. Many thanks to Caterina and all her staff. Review #62:my girlfriend and i are here on our last night unfortunately. We love this hotel. Room 101 is beautiful. Has a view of the musuem and is really quiet. Staff are friendly and the breakfast was delicious if you like the typical European breakfast. This hotel is an awesome value. It's a few hundred feet from the grand canal. I would honestly not need to spend the extra money for a hotel that faces it anyways. We'll definitely be staying here again. Ciao David P Review #63:We booked here for a hotel in the heart of Venetian Venice after finding it on Google Earth. An inspired choice - wonderfully modernised and refurbished old building, very accessible from the waterbuses (an essential for getting around in Venice, and one of the nearby stops is on the express airport run) and only a miunute away from oustanding local restaurants with excellent quality and prices. The rooms are superb - we had luxury in red with fabric coated walls and a very comfortable bed. Good breakfast, and the staff could not be friendlier or more welcoming. This will certainly be a hotel we will revisit. Review #64:Not only was our room beautiful and spacious. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They were willing to book tours, dinner, and attractions for us and did a lovely job. The location was a bit hard to find lugging our suitcases through the winding streets, and the gondola crossing closest to the hotel seemed to be closed. However, once we made it there, we appreciated the location away from the heavy tourist traffic and there was a small market near by. The decor of the hotel was quite lovely, and included many murano glass chandeliers and sconces. Review #65:Venice is certainly not an easy city to deal with -- but this hotel goes out of its way to alleviate some of the challenges. Our room was charming and spacious; the bathroom was a bit small -- but convenient. Breakfast was ample and good! The staff -- although a bit harried -- took time to deal with individual traveller concerns. (The hotel had a lot of guests!) The location -- beside the Natural History museum -- is a short walk from a dock at the end of the street. A taxi from the station is 40 euros -- and, therefore, getting to the hotel is relatively easy. The San Toma vaporetto station is not the far away either -- and taking the vaporetto is much easier than navigating through Venice's complicated streets -- just walk \"inland\" from the vaporetto station nearest to where you are going. The hotel arranged to have a boat meet us at the dock at the end of the street for a transfer to the airport; so I can say that this hotel has service down to a science! Review #66:My husband and I stayed for two nights over New Years Eve and had chosen the hotel due to the excellent reviews here. The place was very clean and well appointed, lovely decor in our tiny standard room (the bathroom was huge and very nice). But the service really let it down. When we arrived (early) they were too busy to check us in properly so we were told to leave our bags in the (unsecured) dining room and come back later). No map, no guidance, no attention. Then when we did come back our bags were still downstairs, forgotten about. By this time there was one staff member, a man, who made smarty-pants remarks to everything we said. He was helpful enough, but only after making smarmy comments. When we enquired about wi-fi my husband was told it was only reliable in the small lobby and he was left waiting for half an hour for a password (she'd said to wait and then forgotten that he was over on the couch in plain view, waiting). The bed was very hard (but better than some we'd stayed in like th el cheapo backpackers in Naples). Mr Smarmy did deliver some excellent help at this stage and found me a cot mattress to pad the bed with. The room was very dark with the blinds closed, so much so that we overslept and didn't realise that it was morning when it was (set your alarms). For how the hotel looked and its rating, the breakfast was surprisingly supermarket-ish. Not particularly enticing at all - just supermarket pre-packaged baked goods. Then to top it off as we checked out we watched in amazement as a couple checking in were given a map and detailed directions for getting around and all their service came with a smile and no smarm from Mr Smarmy. Review #67:The hotel is lovely, the rooms beautifully decorated, spacious and very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was great for us, as it was quiet, but at the same time an easy walk to St Mark's Sq, or the Vaporetto, and there are a couple of nice restaurants in the area (avoid Captains Cabin though!). The only negative aspect of our stay was that on arrival we were told that there had been a \"problem with the system\" and that despite booking in May, we would be in a downstairs room next to reception for the first two nights, then move to a better room for the last two nights. We were assured that the room downstairs was a superior double, but having been moved upstairs to Room 104, I'm pretty sure Room 01 is a classic double. It was a shame to put a dampener on what was a lovely trip. Review #68:We love the people at this hotel . we came to venice at the tail end of a trip to italy to indulge in the romance of the city . unfortunately we made 2 huge mistakes upon arriving . first to avoid the high cost of water taxis we attempted to walk from the parking area to the hotel . this was a huge mistake as we got lost ,and had to navigate steps and bridges with our bags. when we finally made it to the hotel which was very hard to find ,we could not find our wallets or passports . the desk clerk was very sweet and allowed us to go to our room and collect our thoughts . we found our stuff back in the car , and finally checked in officially 4 hours later . the hotel was a great value, very clean ,very comfortable, and staff couldn't have been nicer. so even though venice was a huge disappointment , dirty expensive and unfriendly , the hotel was exactly opposite. we would recommend this hotel as long as you don't mind being out of the area where all of the major attractions are . it is quiet and lovely . Review #69:Great hotel central to everything but in a quiet area, staff were fantastic and Caterina welcomed us with open arms. Very clean and spacious rooms. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. My sisters and I will definitely be back. 5 star hotel for sure. Thanks Caterina Review #70:My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. We reached Venice train station late in the night and decided to walk to the hotel. But even with a very detailed map, we had some trouble finding the location. The guy at the reception was pretty friendly and suggested many must-see places in the area and even took the pains to mark them on the map. The room was nice (even had a small provision for skylight). It is also equipped with all required amenities. Internet is also available in the room. The breakfast was very basic but filling. One has to walk some distance to get to the main centres. But overall, i give a thumbs-up! Review #71:Lovely, quiet hotel in (slightly) less touristy area of the city. Front desk was accommodating at all times. Breakfast was very good and generous. Despite the fact we were on a ground floor room, I slept like a baby and felt very secure. For older travellers getting to other parts of the city may be a bit arduous; we were fine with taking the public boats, for which we bought a three day pass, very much needed. All in all, a positive experience in a city overrun by tourists. Review #72:We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Al Duca and it's an easy call to give it a rating of 5. Our triple room was perfect, with a very roomy bathroom (which we have found rare in Europe). The room itself was very spacious. It's somewhat hard to find in the maze of Venetian streets, but it's a short walk and only a few steps on one bridge from the Riva Biasio vaporetto stop. The adventure of finding it and navigating the \"streets\" is part of the fun. The hotel staff was very helpful, the breakfast was fine (but why wouldn't you wander the streets sampling the other foods available?) and the bed was comfortable. The A/C worked very well, and the windows with shutters added to the charm. We'd go back in a heartbeat. Review #73:We were only in Venice to acclimate (flew from Seattle) as our ultimate destiny was Dubrovnik, but we ended up staying three nights to see if our luggage would show up. The staff at Al Duca was very accommodating; they had to move us one night since our initial reservation was one night and we were upgraded for the same price. The hotel itself was lovely, the rooms were a nice size, the shower pressure was great, the heat was respondent, the breakfast was tasty, the hotel was quiet. All in all, a nice experience and aside from the missing luggage, a perfect kick-off to a wonderful vacation. Review #74:My two friends and I stayed for only one night.....we had previously stayed in Venice for seven nights at a different hotel and were now on our way home after visiting the Veneto. The location of Al Duca di Venezia is excellent if you are leaving Venice as it is only one stop on the vaporatto after the train station and two beyond the Tronchetto parking lot. It is easily walkable from either but be mindful that if walking from the train you must cross over a large bridge with many stairs. When we arrived we were greeted by a woman who was just mildly pleasant. She seemed only to have pat answers for sightseeing questions I had and I left the desk feeling like I knew more about the area than she did. The room to which we were assigned was the red room....truly a lovely room, but only if there are two people sharing it. The extra bed, and I am being generous here, was just a small cot with an extremely thin mattress. It was suitable for a small child under 10. We three have been traveling for years and never have we been given an extra bed of this quality. I would have very much appreciated it if they said they were not equipped to handle three adults in one room and we would have booked elsewhere. Review #75:Venice is such a beautiful and wondrous location to begin with and then staying here was just a finishing touch to the start of our holiday. From the Vaporetto stop you only have to cross one bridge in the 5 min walk. The red room with high ceilings were better than the website shows. Katherine at the front desk during the day was so friendly and helpful. I just loved the kitschy look of the lobby and the breakfast was plenty to tide us over until way past noon. Great quiet neighborhood away from the tourist locations and actually near a square where the local children play after school. Will stay here again when we return. Review #76:We had difficulty finding the hotel walking from the train station. The brochure shows the hotel as being situated \"on the canal\" when in actuality it is located a little further down from the canal. Once we were checked in, we found our room to be very nice,clean and the staff were eager to accomodate. I liked the location and like everywhere in Venice, well within walking distance to the Rialto bridge and San Marco square. Despite that the hotel is on the pricey side, I would recommend it to friends. Review #77:The hotel is well situated for frequent trains into Venice which are priced at just 1.80euro each way per person. The room we had was plenty large enough, had air conditioning, (a must in summer months), and was generally very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and the staff extremely friendly. Having been told how expensive Venice is, I thought at first that the rate quoted for 4 nights was the night rate and was very pleasantly surprised to find it was the rate for bed and breakfast for the 4 nights. Excellent value for money, I would recommend this hotel. BUT, ask for one of the quiet rooms on the side of the hotel. The rooms adjacent to the Square to the front of the hotel are affected by noise from the bar in the same Square. Review #78:This hotel is on the north side of the island and right off the main canal. It is directly behind the Museum of Natural History. The water taxi dropped us off from the airport and it was less than 1/2 a block to the front door. We took the Red Family room that is pictured on their site and it was really lovely. Our girls (11 and 14) thought it was magical. The bathroom is newly renovated and very clean and functional. The hotel is very quiet and it is easy to get where you want to go either by Vaparetto or walking. Breakfast included freshly baked pastries that hit you by nose before you are fully awake......YUM! Good service, helpful staff and free internet. Loved our stay here and loved Venice! Review #79:We spent 4 nights in this hotels. we arrived from Milan on 7Nov, a lousy day :the water bus was on strike and raining heavily, St Marco was flooded. We walk about 10 min following the instruction on the web, up and down the bridge with 3 pieces of luggages in the rain. and it was easily located and the reception was warm and friendly. We have booked a superior room and was given a superior room just behind the reception on ground floor, what a relief. though it may look a bit different from the picture. But it is spacious and well equipped. we even do our laundry everyday and clothing were dry the next morning because of the heater in the bathroom. Though this is a small hotel, but easily access to all places, and away from the bustle and hustle and the crowd. Staff were very friendly and helpful to show us the direction to places of interest and restaurants. Overall, great hotel and service. Review #80:The hotel was beautiful, just like the pictures. The service was fantastic. The family room was perfect and accommodated a family consisting of 2 adults and 2 young adults. We fell in love with Venice and cannot wait to return. The city did not smell during our visit and was cleaner than Rome or Florence. Review #81:The hotel is located in a very quiet part of Venice, about a 15-minute walk from the train station and a 15 to 20 minute walk to Plaza San Marco. We were given a room on the ground floor behind the reception desk. The room had a small window facing the street, and being at ground level, the view was not very good. You may want to inquire if this is the only standard room available. The people working at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Upon check-in, the person at the reception desk gave us a map and really took the time to instruct us on the location of the hotel, how to get to various sites of interest, and how to take the water bus. This guy deserves a pay raise. I can confirm the reviews on this website about the quality of the rooms. Our room was clean and richly decorated. The bathroom is large and for the price, I was pleasantly surprised to find free disposable bath products, unlike other hotels in Europe. The shiny marble tiles add to the aesthetic appeal. For a wonderful stay in lovely Venice, book your room at this cozy hotel now. Review #82:Hotel is modern and well appointed with free wi-fi and computer (great for downloading photos from camera memory card to our external hard drive). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say the hotel is more 4 stars than 3. DELUXE FAMILY ROOM - Very large modern and luxurious bathroom, massive bedroom with couch and small writing table. Beautiful d\u00c3\u00a9cor. BREAKFAST \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Very generous choices and all tasted great - cold meats, cheeses, cereals, different pastries/sweets, yogurt, tea/coffee, juices.. LOCATION \u00e2\u20ac\u201c From train station - 10min walk (with luggage), including steps at 1 main bridge plus 2 small bridges. No hassle for us (30 years old). From St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square \u00e2\u20ac\u201c They say its 30mins but it feels less and we strolled it and looked at lots of shops and scenery on the way. We felt the hotel recommendations for restaurants, gondola, and glass blowing, where because the hotel receives commission/kick-backs. although having said that, we had a good experiences at them all. The only thing we would mention to be mindful of is that if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one for sales people and sales situation, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to their glass blowing experience on Murano island. The glass blowing demonstration was max. 10mins long then we spent the rest of the time trying to politely escape their sales people who really wanted to sell us a vase for 1,000 euro because I was silly enough to ask a question about it. It was a funny experience and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t regret doing it (especially because we got a private water taxi out to the Island, all included in the 8 euro price). Overall, definitely recommend this hotel. Review #83:My daughter & I stayed here for one night in July 2011. We arrived by train and found the hotel without getting lost. It was very clean and well appointed. Room was very large. The only thing was, our bathroom was up two flights of stairs and down a service corridor. It was clean and well equipped etc., just not as convenient as having the bathroom adjoining your room. If I were to stay here again, I would make sure I had an ensuited room. Otherwise, vaporetto stop fairly close by and well located. We were leaving for Venice on the overnight train which didn't leave till 9pm, and the hotel allowed us to leave our bags there all day after we had checked out, which was appreciated. Review #84:This is a pleasant, clean and well run hotel, within 10 minutes walk of St Lucia station, with some good sized rooms, and some very small ones. The small ones are really only just enough to fit the bed in. It is close to a pontoon on the grand canal for private water taxis. It is not in a noisy part of the city, but convenient enough to vaporetto stops to get about easily. Prices are alright (for Venice), but I would not take their recommendations for restaurants too seriously. The one we tried was only average quality and very expensive. Review #85:After reading lots of reviews of this hotel i deceided to book it as i wanted something special for my wedding anniversary. On the day of departure we went to pay for our bill but for some unknown reason the travel card i had wasn't working. I kept putting my pin in but it kept refusing. The manager there was not helpful. She was rude & just kept talking over me. Because of her rudeness i had to walk away & so i deceided to phone the card people up to find out why it wasn't working. They informed me that i only had \u00e2\u201a\u00ac415 instead of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac545. I knew what was wrong. The hotel had blocked \u00e2\u201a\u00ac125 from the card as a cancellation fee in case we didn't turn up so the amount i thought was on there wasn't & this was down to the hotel. The manager tried to hide it from us trying to steal money from us. As a manager they should know this & it's there duty to inform the customers of this which the manager of this hotel never. I will not be returning to this hotel again. If you go all i can say is watch your pennies! Review #86:Hotel has such attention to detail. We stayed in a Superior Room and it was fantastic. Clean and lovely, just a little dark though, but otherwise we couldn't fault it. There are also beautiful chandeliers all over the hotel. Service was great, especially the coffee & milk jugs at breakfast! Loved it, deserves much more than 3 stars. Review #87:We stayed in one of the 'red premium' rooms for one night in early July. It was one of the nicest hotel rooms we ever stayed in, complete with upholstered walls! The bathroom was very nice as well. The air conditioning was excellent, and while the wi-fi connection was inconsistent at times (they turn the wi-fi off at 8am on the day of checkout), this wasn't a major issue. The staff is very helpful and the breakfast was amazing. If you're familiar with Venice, you'll appreciate that this hotel is closer to the train station, and if you're willing to walk to San Marco (approx. 25 minutes) or pay a few bucks and travel on the water, you'll appreciate not lugging your bags all around Venice. Great hotel overall! Highly recommended! Review #88:Pretty little boutique hotel. Situated very close to the train station (1 waterbus stop away). A fantastic restaurant right around the corner from it as well. The furnishing are a bit weathered, mirrors were rusty but that wasn't a problem for us. The bed was comfortable and we had a good night sleep. Review #89:We loved this hotel. In a two-week trip through Italy which included some very pretty places, this was absolutely our favorite. It is a renovated duke's palace, open since May 2010 & they did an outstanding job of it, with upholstered walls, spacious glamorous bathroom, a marvelously comfortable bed, Venetian chandelier, and large rooms. Ours had a sofa, a desk, a king bed, & another table. Service was excellent; we got tips on where to go & how to get there. It was in a neighborhood, out of the way of the Rialto/St Mark's bustle, so it was very quiet at night. We ate one breakfast there, which was good but not included in price of stay & wasn't anything out of the ordinary. We were able to order an omelette though. Wonderful places to eat right around there, or take a water taxi anywhere. Can't say enough about this hotel, it was just incredibly beautiful & in the perfect location for us. We didn't do any business things so not sure if there is a computer for our use. I don't recall if they have wi-fi. Parking not an issue since cars are not allowed in Venice. Review #90:Beautiful hotel with beautiful rooms! We stayed at this hotel after seeing the great tripadvisor reviews, and were not disappointed! We had one of the gold rooms and it was very classy and clean. The hotel is not near the touristy areas, but since Venice is so small, it is so easy to walk everywhere. The staff were very nice, helpful, and always answered our questions. The service at breakfast was prompt and the food was good. We were in Venice during a heatwave, and the air conditioning was so good that we turned it off often! There are small restaurants steps away, and a grocery store just around the corner for essentials. My husband and I highly recommend. Review #91:My husband and I went to Venice after finishing a cruise. We stayed at this hotel and the staff were so friendly and helpful, especially Michelle. I have attached photos of the wheelchair accessible room and though not the standard we are used to in North America, it was pretty good after our experience in Barcelona. The hotel is very clean and in a good location by the Museum of Natural History (Museaodi Storia Nautrale) and very quiet. They offer a delicious breakfast in the morning, which is a great way to start your day before riding around on the water taxis (free if you are in a wheelchair). Of course our room on Holland America's Nieuw Amsterdam gave us much comfort to see parts of Europe, it was welcoming to have a hotel like this to finish our trip. Venice is VERY difficult in a wheelchair because of all the bridges being steep and staired. It was a real challenge to get around and we would not return to here because of those issues. The most accessible place we found in Venice was the Island of Lace (Burano) as it was very flat with many options of getting around and not so many staired bridges. Review #92:I cannot say enough about this small boutique hotel....and Katerina and the efficient staff that maintain this hotel. The location is outstanding.....in a real neighborhood, close to the first vaparetto stop, near the train station, but away from all the tourists. The hotel is newly renovated and has every ammenity. I originally tried to book a room in a hotel near the San Marco Plaza, but believe me you will love the quiet neighborhood, away from all the throngs and tourist action. All the tour books told us to get lost in the back streets, and that is exactly what we did...just headed generally for the main Rialto bridge....you will find your way, and a beautiful surprise around every corner. Do not even think of any other accomodation. Review #93:An 8 minute walk from the train station (P. Roma) following the \"yellow signs\" for the Natural History Museum gets you easily to this beautiful 300+ year old hotel. It's small (22 rooms) but elegant. We stayed in the very roomy Gold Tone Superior room with a shower. It had a very comfortable King Bed with a Murano Chandelier and very old wood parquait floors. The bathroom was recently remodelled with new fixtures and marble counters. It was very quiet since it's in the middle of a neighborhood. It's steps away from both a Vaporetto stop and a Traghetto and a 8 minute walk to the Rialto Bridge. You can walk anywhere in Venice from this hotel in 30 minutes or less! The breakfasts were good (especially the blood oranges, the prosciutto, and the pastries) . There is a great restaurant that is 1-2 minutes away (La Zucca) and a wonderful little grocery store with good inexpensive wines, gelato, and a great tiramisu for only 2.5 euro (It's called Majer). Highly Recommended! Review #94:There's a reason this is one of the top hotels on TripAdvisor - it deserves to be there. We stayed here for 2 nights early January, the first night in a Superior room, the second in the Classic room. Both were nice, but if you can, I would pay the extra and get the more spacious, lavishly decorated Superior room (pictured). Pros: EXCELLENT SERVICE! New, clean and elegantly decorated rooms. Free internet in your room (Ethernet cable provided). Very spacious in the Superior room. The continental breakfast was great - pastries, croissants, cereal, cheese, individual jars of jam ect. Excellent value for money. Cons: The hotel is small so there is no room service but that's about all I can fault. We would like to thank Caterina for being such an accommodating and helpful host. We had such a wonderful stay and will definitely be returning. Review #95:This is the hotel you are searching for. Very nice personel, very pretty hotel and so a very nice stay. We were here with two children (8) en (14) in a familyroom. Wifi worked very well. Left a big tip for the cleaninglady. Review #96:A group of 10 adults traveling together and we were all able to get rooms at this wonderful hotel; reserve early or it will be sold out! The hotel is beautifully decorated as well as the individual rooms. We asked that all our rooms were in the hotel and not in the adjoining building where they have an apartment. We all thought the location was perfect and enjoyed walking and getting lost (it's Venice!). It is near the train station and was an easy walk with luggage (only 1 or 2 bridges to get over). The breakfast was also nice and they made it especially for us since we were all leaving on an early train. Great service! Review #97:really great place for family, couples, friends, business everything. very good value for price, really pretty rooms. clean n staff was always very friendly and helpful. good location. good amenities except only 2/3 tv channels n like all hotels we stayed at in italy the tvs were like 8 inches! breakfast was ok. no fitness center or spa. its highlights were mainly its decorations n great staff n location. Review #98:Just a quick note to thank all the staff there for a very enjoyable stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly the young woman on reception who gave us much valuable information regarding things to do and where to eat. We stayed for 4 nights and the staff could not be more helpful. We stayed on one of the 3rd floor rooms, and whilst I would agree that the slanted ceiling in the bathroom could be challenging for taller guests, it posed fewer problems for us shorter people! Room was very comfortable and the air-conditioning was most welcome !! All in all I would recommend it for anyone wanting a \"venice-reasonable\" priced hotel, in a good location for exploring Venice on foot or via the waterboat. Review #99:Lovely small newly renovated hotel with clean room in a quiet neighborhood which suited us perfectly. The rooms had a classic decorations made it felt very special comparing to standard hotel room. The hotel can be easily accessed by 15min walk from Rialto bridge (airport link) or 5min from the St. Stae stop.There is a Traghetto (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac 0.5) crossing just next to the hotel, which we recommend to try.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The gourmet food is above-average and well-priced, with a nice wine bar next door worth trying out"], "input": "Review #0:When returning to Vancouver after a side trip to Victoria, we chose the Moda Hotel for three reasons: its proximity to the Skytrain to the airport, the good price, and our desire to explore a different part of Vancouver: up-and-coming Yaletown. Based on Tripadvisor reviews, we had contacted the reception and asked to be put in a quiet room that had already undergone their soundproofing renovation. The hotel did indeed put us into a quiet room; we could hear neither our neighbors nor too much of the traffic outside. So ask for a soundproof-renovated room when making your reservation. Our room was very bright and had an interesting color scheme, but showed a bit of wear and tear. We noticed the slightly slanted floor in this old building, but considered it an interesting feature. Yaletown was fascinating to explore, and it was hard to pick a restaurant given all the great choices. Review #1:Convenient location close to the city center. The hotel appears to be renovated and very modern, but it looks nicer on the pictures. The room has a cheap touch to it. There is no ability to stop in front of the hotel to check in and the staff was rather unmotivated - they never even looked up when we passed by. Review #2:We stayed at the Moda before and after our cruise to Alaska. Our ship left from Ballantyne Pier so wanted a hotel that was centrally located in the downtown area with access to Stanley Park, Chinatown, Granville Island. The front desk staff was extremely helpful even offering us a Moda umbrella since it was raining and we didn't bring one. During our stay on the front half, we were in an outside room overlooking Smithe St. Since they are in the midst of building a massive building across the street, it was fairly noisy but once we closed the windows, the noise was muted. They have those great tower fans (Sharper Image type) that really circulate the air well. I imagine that if it hit 80 degrees outside, then it might be too warm but we were fine. They were also installing a second set of windows to help reduce the noise which would certainly help. The rooms were very clean and highly functional with flat screens TVs that were mounted to the wall. We took taxis most places since we had five in our party and that seemed to work pretty well. There were plenty of coffee shops (Starbucks in every direction), restaurants - we liked Crepe Cafe (block and a half) and Salathai (three blocks) and a neat market (Nesters) and a liquor store next to the hotel. We saw a fair bit of rain so didn't enjoy being out and about as much as we'd hoped but still go to see most of the key sights. I'd stay at the Moda again as it really met our needs. Review #3:We stayed at the Moda Hotel for 3 nights in October. We chose it because it was reasonably priced, and the location was great. Our group had 2 rooms - one was a Deluxe Queen, the other a Deluxe King. The king room was a corner room with two walls of windows. It faced the busy Seymour intersection, but with the windows closed the noise wasn't bothersome to us. The queen room had a larger / better arranged bathroom. However, the view was of an alley (not as pretty obviously, but much quieter). The beds were comfortable and the space was good in both rooms. We very much appreciated the free wi-fi, and we used it quite often. We also made use of the breakfast vouchers that came with our rooms. We had breakfast every morning at UVA. It was never crowded and the service was friendly. Our rooms also came with discount cards for the properties restaurants. We had dinner at Red Card one night. I wasn't a huge fan of the soup I had, but the pizza was great. Our waitress noticed I didn't love the soup, and took it off our bill. That was really nice of her! The parking for the hotel is actually 1 block down. After checking in, we were directed to the parking ramp and we were able to find it without a problem. We were happy to have in/out privileges. The location of the Moda is perfect! Everything is within walking distance - including a grocery store, coffee shops, Robson Street, fancy restaurants, fast-food restaurants, etc. We would 100% stay at the Moda again. It's a very beautiful, European-style hotel with wonderful staff. Review #4:Twin rooms have 2 double beds. Hotel is an old building, and not very easy to find - it is part of a wine bar and restaurant. The rooms are nicely refurbished, although there was an unusual smell in the landing on our floor, but it didn't affect the room. Nevertheless, I would recommend for the price and location. Review #5:Moda Hotel is a very accessible and chic hotel.. Loved the decor and the hotels room and its essential amenities as well... It was just what I needed for a visit in Vancouver.. Based on the other reviews, yes the walls are thick and you can really hear your neighbors talking but it didn't disturb our sleep after a full day of exploring Vancouver... if you are a very light sleeper, then the noise might keep you up at night. Overall, I would go back regardless of the noise. The hotel met my requirements: I needed a nice, chic and safe place to sleep in downtown Vancouver. Also, the staff were ALL very helpful with our queries, requests, etc... Overall a very nice experience! Review #6:Probably one of my overall favorite boutique hotels to stay in! The hotel is clean. The staff is incredibly nice, helpful, friendly and went out of their way to be accommodating! The location is perfect for downtown Vancouver -- within walking distance of several theatres and a block away from the bars, restaurants, Robson, shopping and clubs of Granville Avenue. The hotel is within several city blocks of most of the major downtown attractions, including Yaletown, Gastown, the arena and Chinatown. The bus service in downtown is a bit pricey, but runs everywhere and often. Moda Hotel doesn't have WiFi, but has great free high speed internet by ethernet. The hotel has been recently renovated and I love the new decor! The rooms are stark, modern and clean. Some might find them a little small, but this is an old building. The beds were firm and very comfortable. Even the pillows were better than average. Previous comments have mentioned the noise from the pub that used to be downstairs. For our stay in Oct 2007, the pub had been closed for a while and club noise wasn't an issue. Unfortunately, there is A LOT of construction in Downtown Vancouver, which is fairly loud starting around 8:00 am (except Sundays) or so. Not a problem for us as it made an excellent alarm clock.... I suspect this is a problem all over downtown. The price was among the lower of the hotels we looked at, but this hotel was by far the best value within any price range. I'll be recommending this hotel to my friends and it will definitely be our first hotel of choice when we return to Vancouver. Can you tell that we liked this place? Review #7:We were just doing an overnight and did not have much time. Arrived in the later afternoon. You have to park across the street after you get a pass from the hotel. I had to drop off my fiance and drive around while he got the pass. Then we parked and rolled our luggage to the hotel. It was pleasant, priced well and close walking to everything. We walked to shopping, walked to the restaurant we had dinner at, back to the hotel and then to breakfast in the morning. That was great. The room was very nice and large. The only two negatives were the TV in the bedroom did not work. There is another TV in the sitting area. And the placement of the hair dryer is inconvenient. On a wall where the toilet is in the way, so it was hard to dry my hair. Other than that....no complaints. It was priced well and great location. I would stay here again. There are two places to dine right there and that is great if you want to relax and hang around. For the money, it was a nice place and friendly people. Review #8:My husband and I spent two nights for our Anniversary Weekend in Vancouver. We drove up to Vancouver from Seattle. I brought a dozen cupcakes from a popular cupcakery in Seattle called Trophy. The box was placed on the desk. To my dismay, when we got back to the hotel, the maid threw the box on the floor ruining the cupcakes! She did not even write a note or put the box back on the desk. I went downstairs and showed the Manager the ruined cupcakes and they promptly refunded my purchase. Put a damper on my trip and we ended up checking out a day early. The front desk staff was nice so was the breakfast at the bar next door. Review #9:I have stayed here twice. I find it excellent value. Location is very convenient and walking distance to shopping, restaurants and downtown core of Vancouver. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful..it feels like home away from home. The service is very good and the food is above average. It has a boutique - type feel to it..the decor is very funky. On my next business trip or on my next leisure trip with my family I will certainly stay here again. Review #10:This hotel is in a great location to everything. The staff was friendly. Our stay was in August and yes even Vancouver gets hot weather the hotel nor any restaurant etc... have air conditioning so yes it was hot. They provide a fan in the room but being very spoiled by air conditioning it was still HOT - not their fault. Also because it is near to many areas it is noisey - bring ear plugs if you want to sleep or can't sleep in a busy city. Good clean motel in a city blighted with homeless. Recomend highly - great price! Review #11:The hotel was a great location in downtown Vancouver. We could walk to all the attractions, and were able to leave the car safely parked most of the time. The decoration was tasteful and modern and the staff was very helpful. The bed was a little hard for my taste. Overall a good value. Review #12:My boyfriend and I decided to stay over night in Vancouver after our flight back from San Franscisco before we headed home to Langley. He was suffering from really bad allergies on the night we stayed, Philipe from the front desk was amazing. He went from room to room with us to so we could have a room that didn't have fumes from the recent renovation he gave us the perfect room, brought up new keys and an usb cable for our laptop!! Amazing I have stayed at 5star hotels and I had the best experience here, even if the hotel was 3 star!! WOW! ! Review #13:I was traveling with my husband and good male friend. We got the room via Priceline and got it for $99 plus tax. When the conformation via Priceline arrived we found out it was reservations for two. My friend called to ask for two double beds. They said they would try but no promises. When we arrived, the room was one king. We explained our situation. They told us they could put us in the double room but it was above the bar and it would be very noisy. We said that would not work and was there another hotel close by so our male traveling compainon could stay there. They said hold on and might have something. After a bit of discussion, they offered us the king room with a rollaway bed. We took it. The room was a bit small compared to a US room but was very much like a Europian room. The room was on the corner with lots of windows and no air conditioning. We opened the windows which brought in the city noise. If you are light sleeper, it might bother you. But really liked it. The rollaway bed was fine for the night. Review #14:My husband and I were visiting Vancouver with family and while other family members stayed with friends, we decided to stay at The Moda Hotel. First, the promotion rate we received was great! We reserved our room directly through the hotel website and pricing was more than reasonable! In addition, we received $10 a day for breakfast at UVA, a wine bar next to the hotel. This breakfast voucher was enough to get my husband a Cafe Americano and myself a Oolong tea every morning, along with large chocolate croissants to share. The room we reserved was a Deluxe King Standard Room, and the room we received was the exact room to one of the pictures on their website. It had red walls, a king bed, bathroom. It was on the 3rd floor, and I asked upon checking in for a \"quiet\" room, so it wouldn't be as noisy. The bathroom was updated, and while the room overall was small, I didn't expect more given it was a \"boutique\" hotel. Most boutique hotels I have stayed at, usually has character, amenities and great customer service, but rooms can be on the smaller side. Either way, we enjoyed the room, it served it's purpose! Front desk was AWESOME - Phillipe and Samir were so friendly and accommodating on our stay, helping us out with places to go, and visit, restaurants to eat at. Location was awesome - located in the arts and entertainment district, still considered Downtown Vancouver, and close to restaurants, shopping on Robson St. We were literally 1.5 blocks away from the famous Japadog! Review #15:I've stayed at the m MODA a few times now and every experience has been fantastic. great staff, very clean and a perfect location if you want to explore downtown Vancouver. The price is always reasonable and we love the Symphony suite in particular. The wine bar is pleasant and relaxing. We've also travelled with our pooch and he loves the neighborhood for walks. Review #16:This boutique hotel is in a very convenient location in downtown Vancouver. The first time I stayed there, I was in the outside corner room (just luck) and it was great, windows on two sides, lots of light, big room, very nice! The second time I stayed there, it was the inside corner room, so much smaller, only one window and less light. Fine, just a disappointment compared to the other room. Otherwise a great place, charming feel, great little wine bar in the basement with great cocktails and small plates. Overall a great spot to stay. Good value. Review #17:I found my way to the Hotel Moda via a price-based internet search. In town for a conference and only needing a comfortable, downtown place to drop my head, my expectations were not very high but the Hotel Moda is my new, favourite Vancouver Hotel. Freshly done up it is clean, fresh and charming and even has comfortable beds. It was only a lack of room service that prevented me from giving it an EXCELLENT review but you won't be disappointed if you want great value - Hotel Moda has it! Review #18:My husband and I stayed in a Junior room - tiny room + bathroom with full size bed. For us, it was similar to what we have had in Europe so the size didn't bother us. (We also didn't spend much time in our room). We really enjoyed the location, and the hotel itself was clean. I wasn't impressed with the bed linens or pillows, but it wasn't bad by any means. Overall, I think the value was good as we were able to stay downtown in a good location. I would stay here again, but I would also check other hotel deals before committing. Review #19:Got a special rate to stay in the Moda and it was good value for money. A central location not far from the main shopping area and local attractions. The room was recently refurbished with colourful decoration and was quiet, spacious and clean. There is a bus stop just outside and the train station is a short walk away. There is a business room with a computer and free use of the internet. The staff were friendly and willing to assist. Review #20:Sure it's not a Corporate Multinational hotel - but that's what makes it awesome! Very much a european style hotel with modest rooms in a totally renovated older building. Location can't be better, the caf\u00e9 downstairs has excellent coffee. Unless you're elderly/disabled what's wrong with taking a flight of stairs? C'mon are we that lazy these days! Slept great, nice that they use natural laundry products so you dont wake up feeling like you've slept next to a chemical factory. Showers had plenty of water. Review #21:The Moda is a nice change from chain hotels and has a personality of its own. As an older building that has been refurbished, it has good character. We had a room facing away from the street, so there was minimal traffic noise. The staff were friendly. I would stay again. Review #22:Hotel moda is a older hotel that has been updated. The price points are un-beatable for downtown and it is clean. The hotel tends to be louder as it is so old, so if you are a light sleeper its better to stay elsewhere. The Skoah products in the bathroom are great! Review #23:I recently stayed in the Moda Hotel and I was very happy with my stay. With the hotel being right downtown, I was close to all of the shopping. The staff was very friendly, making sure I was comfortable and had everything I need. The rooms there are beautiful and the designs were all very modern. I had a great stay and I highly reccommend this hotel for anyone who needs a nice place to stay in the Vancouver downtown area. Review #24:This was the 3rd time I've stayed at the Moda Hotel. They never disappoint. The location is perfect, close to downtown and Robson St and only a half hour walk to all the great shopping over at W 4th. Staff are friendly and helpful and always let me store my bags for the day after checkout before the midnight flight home. Great breakfast in Uva with a free $10 voucher. I will continue to stay at Moda each year on my way home from the slopes. Review #25:The thing I remember the most about this hotel is the extreme temperature in the room. I stayed there for 3 nights in December. My first night there, the room was freezing. After looking for the nonexistent thermostat in the room, I decided to call it a loss and hoped for the night to pass quickly. After mentioning this to reception the following morning, they turned up the heat on the entire 3rd floor (apparently, the temperature control works for all the rooms on specific floors -- there are no controls in individual rooms!). The result: I slept with no blankets on for the remaining two nights. It felt like a warm summer's evening in the room. Despite that, the bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of channels offered on tv. As for the room size: they are considerably smaller than the pics on the websites -- they're taken with wide-lens cameras. Don't be shocked if your room is smaller than what the pics show. For breakfast, try Subeez Cafe at the corner of Homer & Smithe Streets. Review #26:I went to stay at Moda for a week and it was my first time to Vancouver. The location was PERFECT ! downtown Van was only a few blocks away, a good walk to gastown too. Overall, my stay was great. Everyday I came back to my hotel room and it looked brand new ! Now, I do admit the walls are a bit thin so you can hear a little bit of hallway noise but nothing that was enough to bother us. Ohh and a greattt bed too ! Nice linens and clean bathroom. Uva bar has greatttt drinks ! The Hotel was a great price and a good stay. I would def stay again Review #27:This is a fun hotel near all the tourist areas. We loved the hip decor and the bright colors inside made up for a couple of grey days outside. The service was good with a couple of hiccups, but nothing that would prevent us from going back. The rooms are very comfortable and the free wifi was very helpful in not running up iPhone roaming charges when we wanted to do a little research on our siteseeing plans for the day. Only ate in the restaurant once and it was one of the \"hiccups\" we encountered. The food was delicious, but the service could have been a little more attentive. Overall grade B+! Review #28:My boyfriend and I enjoyed our short stay at the Moda Hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful, nothing I requested was too big of an ask. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was very convenient. We would definitely stay here again. Review #29:I travel very frequently for business; and, I typically stay in either Hilton chain, Sheraton, or sometimes Best Western hotels. I booked this hotel because this was my first trip to Vancouver and I didn't want to stay in a chain hotel. I liked the photos I saw on Trip Advisor of the rooms' decor. The reviews I read were correct about the noise level. The walls were very thin, and I could hear people in the next room talking clearly. I also heard people walking through the halls often. The decor throughout the hotel and the rooms was very nice; however, my room was not very clean. I found hair on three of the 5 pillows on the bed, as well as on the sheets. The bed was the firmest, most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel. I also found mold on the tile in the shower, and a stain on the wall. Despite all of this, the staff was extremely helpful and kind. Unfortunately, I wouldn't stay here again due to the noise and lack of cleanliness. Review #30:Although we had a great stay in Vancouver and loved the location of this hotel - and the wine bar Uva which we went to almost every night when we returned from dinner out - the rooms were very small and very average - the bed wasn't that comfortable, the bedding seemed a bit tattered and the room smelled a bit musty. It was fine for what we paid for it, but it is certainly not plush by any means - the pictures on the website make the rooms look nicer and more modern than they are. It's a very old hotel that has been refurbished only by making cosmetic changes - so the walls are very very thin and the elevator is tiny, etc. But the wine bar and the sports bar (as well as the Italian restaurant which we didn't get a chance to go to but was always busy) seem to keep this place hopping. The sports bar was pretty cool - large, comfortable with a lot of flatscreens everywhere! Review #31:We really enjoyed our stay at the Moda Hotel. if you are looking for a retro room, this is it! The staff was excellent and courteous. Breakfast at the restaurant was excellent as well and the food was delicious. Thank you for the expresso coffee and taking care of our luggage. We will certainly stay at Moda again when we are in Vancouver. Review #32:Becarful when renting this hotel... especially if you have a pet allergy and do not want smoke filled hallway odours that waft through the vents! I travel to Vancouver almost weekly and we decided on this personal trip to do a boutique hotel... BAD IDEA!\" - Only 1 Elevator (long wait times) - Thin walls you will hear the people above you and next to you - Not great for those who have allergies... - Management lacks the customer service skills to deal with today's educated traveller - they try and belittle you with any requsts - I would recommed the larger hotels within viscinity who are business minded and are concerned with bad experiences... Review #33:This property, we're it in the Czech Republic ( or any European town) would be considered \"quaint\" but in downtown Vancouver it's old and outdated. But struggling to be modern...new furniture may be around but it's old and frumpy. The walls are terribly thin between rooms and even the floors. And you don't want a room that faces Seymour Street...it's unbearable. Staff are super friendly and understand the predicament they are in but there's not much they can do. It's relatively cheap and it is in a good location but those are the only pluses. Look elsewhere if you can...try Le Soleil it's my fav. Review #34:This was only a one night stay while waiting to head out on an Alaskan cruise, but it was definately enough to form an opinion. The hotel is a in a old building that is in pretty good shape. The staff was friendly and helpful. No bellman so it is a do it yourself chore to bring up the luggage. No problem with the elevator. This in the heart of downtown Vancouver. This is a beautiful city. We took a walk down to the pier and watched a cruise ship leave the day before our's left. Two museums close by. If you want there is a hop on - hop off bus system that will take you for a day of exploring. Tim Hortons restaurands abound for those on a budget. Or, splurge and try a great restaurant. Hotel has air conditioning in the lobby and the hallway, but rooms are cooled by opening the window to the Vancouver air and turining on the oscillating desk fan. During our stay, there was construction noise from a new building going up on the other side of the street. The medical center is a couple of blocks a way, so the sound of the siren of a passing ambulance provided an unwanted alarm clock at 4:00AM thru the open fourth story window. But, for this minor drawback, I still would certainly go back. Great location--About a five dollar - five minute ride to the cruise port. Enjoy your stay!!! ! Review #35:i'm often in Vancouver for work. this hotel is the perfect hotel for me. Welcoming and friendly team, simple and nice looking rooms, good beds, weel located. and.... a good restaurant and bar accessible from the lobby. What could be better than that? oh yes... good price too. david Review #36:Stayed here because of price and location. Rooms are small though good value. $10 coupon was included for breakfast. Restaurant was closed first morning because of staffing issues. The discount was honored for lunch with an apology. Would have been a five if more was offered. Staff were polite and helpful. Will be back. Review #37:My girlfriend and I stayed here over New Year's weekend. While this was my first time in Vancouver, I can imagine that this hotel would be extremely difficult to find even for those who visit the city every so often, as it's signage is small and it blends in with the other storefronts in the building. When you finally do find it, you can park curbside to check-in. Leave your bags in the lobby or bring them up to your room, as you'll be parking your car in a garage across the street. The garage is gated (entry by room key only) and will cost you ~$14 a night to park there. The room was not big, but it was clean, had nice decor and provided amenities like wi-fi, an LCD TV (with cable and channels from Seattle, but no HD programming) and the most amazing-smelling bath soaps and shampoos I've ever used. It is NOT the best place to sleep, as the walls are quite thin and you could hear chatter from the hallways as well as traffic noise from the street. The location of the hotel is a huge plus. There are plenty of places to shop and eat within walking distance. Review #38:Stayed at this hotel with girlfriends for a weekend away. Loved the modern room, clean, comfortable beds, and friendly staff. I was a little in awe of the great price considering the downtown location. Well worth the deal! I have stayed at many downtown hotels, this one stands ahead of the rest. We had an alley view, not much to look at, but quieter than the street view my other friends had. Review #39:There really was nothing good about this hotel, and I'm not generally one to write reviews or negative reviews for that matter. The hotel staff were rude and unaccommodating, the lobby was tiny, walls were PAPER THIN, very noisy, The beds were super uncomfortable, rooms tiny....was just a terrible stay. We had been travelling throughout Canada and the US, and this was the ONLY BAD hotel we stayed at. There are MUCH nicer places for LESS! Do not stay here if you are expecting a lot. You wont even get a good nights sleep, you can hear the TV through the room next door. Review #40:Hi, It was a girl's night out in town so we booked an affordable, clean room to get ready for some late night dancing. It's newly renovated, so, it's clean. However, there's no air conditioning. So, we find the room very warm and it's difficult to look pretty when your make up is melting away and hair keep getting flat. The hotel is next to a brand new construction...and I didn't know they also dig on a saturday morning ! However, i think it's a ideal location if you want to be in heart of all entertainment, dining and dancing and shopping. It's probably better to go there during early spring / fall when it's not too warm out and you can sleep with the windows closed. or bring ear plugs with you. Review #41:The deciding factors for choosing this hotel were the price, the location and the reviews. Price: Great price (at the time Orbitz had the best rate) Location: 30 minutes from the airport by taxi ~30 CDN. (the bus is 13.50 CDN per person) In walking distance to shopping street and Yaletown. 10 minute taxi to Greyhound Bus Depot (bus to Whistler). Reviews: Bang on. A boutique hotel with minimalist and classy decor. Ultra clean. Coffee maker in room with Numi green tea. Standard hotel room blanket..that icky fuzzy one, but nice bedspread and sheets. The Queen room is very small, but the decor and cleanliness compensate. It is indeed noisy, and the view is not a plus, but that will only bother some. I couldn't quite figure out if the room has a heating system. Our heat was not on and it was a bit cold. For the summer they seem to have a fan... For a short stay, it's just right. Good location, great price, clean and stylish. If you're looking to stay longer you may run into some issues concerning space and environment. Review #42:I knew this hotel before it was the Moda. It was a colourful dive called the Dufferin. Well the Moda is way better now. I really enjoyed the business' attached to the hotel more than the actual hotel. The lobby was nice but I found the rooms pretty small & plain. Too much plain white paint. It was a bit noisy on the Smithe side but not as bad as staying on Granville. The $10 off breakfast at Uva was a nice little perk & the breakfast was quite tasty. I enjoyed my visit as it was a stroll down memory lane! :) Review #43:I have stayed here many times and I am always pleased. The rooms are good, I love the bathrooms, great location and I like the bar downstairs for a night cap. Service is always nice but not over the top. A relaxed hotel in the heart of Vancouver. The only down side is it can be a little noisy on occasion, like once in the 8 times I have stayed there. Review #44:My boyfriend and I headed to Vancouver one night for a concert. I wanted a place to stay that was loated close to Rogers Arena (Where the concert was located) and was a decent price. While online I found this place and did some research on it. I booked for an amazing rice of 108$ for a night in a Deluxe King Suite!! I was very excited about the hotel because it looked so great in the web page. When we got there they let us check in early and we were not disappointed. the location was prime downtown and within about 11 blocks from the concert that night and a block away from the skytrain. The hotel was small with some great resturants and had a very homey feel. We went out to eat that night at the Red Card Sports Pub, a mistake being a Canuks game night, it was loud and crazy in there but the food was decent (esp. the portabello mushroom fires!) The only complaint was that our room was small for being considerded a \"Deluxe Suite\". , but clean and very modern and fun. No complaints from either of us, especially considering the price the room! Review #45:I liked the Moda Hotel, I liked it's location, I liked the attention to detail. It was a little pricey for what I got. I kind of expect breakfast included for what I paid. I had not been to Vancouver in roughly a decade and so I was not aware of the area's reputation and when I told a friend where I would be staying she blanched. But, it has all be regenerated and gentrified and if you want to be in the center of things, look no further than this comfortable hotel. Given its name obviously it wants to fashionable and so it tries hard on this level. I don't know fashion and so this is inevitably lost one me! Review #46:I booked a room in September and wanted to surprise my girlfriend with something. I emailed the hotel to ask what kind of things we could do and they shopped around to give me pricing options on wine, chocolates, flowers and more. We corresponded for a couple of weeks, and when we arrived, everything was perfect and she loved it. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile and it was a wonderful stay. Review #47:Moda Hotel was a perfect little spot to stay in Vancouver. Easy access to Stanley Park, downtown museums, highways, and the rest of the city. The hotel was well appointed, and comfortable. Downside? not enough power-outlets in convenient places. The hotel is exactly what is claims to be: a modern update of an old building. The result is a cute and quirkly modern hotel with some retro touches. A couple of the front desk guys could be a little friendlier, and the hotel is a little hard to find (the name of the hotel is hidden behind a tree). I recommend UVA for breakfasts.... delish!!!! (this is the little restaurant/winebar next door). Review #48:Ideal location on Seymour Street. Hotel staff friendly and helpful... Melanie was very helpful and smiley, I could've chatted to her all day. Chris was lovely too, complementary bubbly for my 40th birthday -- this was very welcome after a 9 hour flight. Very comfortable bed/pillows. Rooms cleaned daily. Good bathroom with hairdryer, bath and shower. If you are a light sleeper you may need ear-plugs as windows single glazed. We had room on 4th floor -- with ear-plugs the noise was not a problem and I would not let it put you off. Air-con is being fitted Autumn 2008, complimentary water provided daily. I would use this hotel again and feel that is worth the money. Robson street shopping area 2 mins walk. \"Whitespot\" diner was great for breakfast 2 short blocks away (4 mins walk) Gas-town & Yaletown within walking distance. BIg BUS tour was very good and I would recommend this in order to get a feel of the area - ticket is valid for two days. Review #49:The Moda hotel exceeded our expectations. Trendy room interior, tasteful and clean. Bathroom was clean, nice decorated, obviously newly renovated. Amenities fresh and we were generously provided with enough everyday. Location was great, but still quiet for a good nights sleep. The hotel is a good boutique hotel with an eye for details. Almost everhing was good.. beside: That the complimentary WiFi access was crap. We had to stand in our door opening to get connection. Thing the Moda guys need to install like 2 or 3 more WiFi outposts. The room has a majorlack or power outlets. Problem if u want to charge phone, iPad and Camera. The house might be 100 years old, but come on, bring us some power for our next stay ;-) Last thing was the carpet in the room, not hygenic and smelled strange as ever. We could see dark wooden floors in a near future! BUT as mentioned, over expectations... Good pricing, friendly staff AND we LOVED the breakfast at UVA! And the Trattoria Restaurant, WOW... a must if you like fresh trendy organic italian food. Yummy! A special thank you to Lars, very helpful and made his best to sort out our power outlet and WiFi problems. We left the hotel with a smile and will be back soon again! Vancouver and Canada is just great! Thank you for this time! Review #50:The Moda is in a convenient location for a visit to Vancouver. We parked the rental car on arrival and walked or took public transportation throughout our trip. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful in all dealings. We had a party of three and were accommodated in two adjoining rooms - one with a full bath and one with a half bath. That was an ideal arrangement. The rooms are very comfortable, but are small. We heard some street noise, but no more or less than one would hear in most larger cities. We will stay at the Moda again when we return to Vancouver. Review #51:So deciding to stay at the Moda was a very Hasty decision. I planned my trip very quickly and basically googled ' boutique hotels+ vancouver'. The Moda immediately stood out for me. The interior design was fantastic, and the history of the hotel sounded very unique. How did it live up to my expectations? The Place - The Hotel itself is smaller than the site, but i think that in itself created the intimate feeling i was looking for. I felt like i was valued as a guest, and that the entire hotel had time for my personal needs. The noise around the hotel was quite loud, but it is in the dowtown core of Vancouver and the crowds and construction are merely the experience. ( I don't see people complaining when they go to New york or other huge cities.) The People- I absolutely loved the staff at the Moda. I can't remember the last time i have gone to a hotel and had a personal conversation and remember the names of the entire staff. Chris, Ivanah, Andrea, and the latest hire Ryan were amazing. Their knowledge of the city and the 'in's and out's' of Vancouver amazed me. They really made me feel like i was staying in good hands, and removed the feeling of being a tourist ( that is something i dread so much) The location- AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.. Right in the heart of downtown and the accessibility is ridiculous ( Ryan gives a good breakdown of the transit system) In the END - I would stay at the Moda in a heartbeat, and i would reccommend it to anyone who is looking to feel young, fresh, and edgy. I can tell the hotel is going to evolve in the next couple of years, but i really hope it keeps it's independent and unpretencious vibe. LOVED IT! Review #52:My boyfriend and I stayed at the Moda while we were in Vancouver for a Canucks game. The staff were very friendly and helpful; our room was ready early and they were quick to greet us. The location was perfect. Walking distance to Rogers Arena, Pacific Mall, and everything else we like to visit when we're in Downtown Vancouver. The hotel itself is very nice, and the rooms are quite interesting (in a good way! ), and very clean. Some reviews complained the bed was too firm, but for us it was perfect. Uva, the cafe/bar downstairs made a cappuccino as good as any I had in Italy, and the best Americano my boyfriend has ever had. All paid for by the $10 credit included with the room. The drawbacks were few, but noticeable. First and foremost, the parking is across the street. It's a bit confusing when checking in (but again, the staff were very helpful), and while it wasn't a problem during the mild weather we experienced, it would be a hassle in the rain or snow. The rooms don't have a fridge, which isn't big deal for most, but we like to bring a few drinks and snacks with us. The sound deadening is minimal. I'm a deep sleeper, but my boyfriend was woken several times by the showers of the adjacent rooms. We never use room TVs, but these are quite small, maybe 27in? Not really on par with most other hotels. All of that said, we really enjoyed our stay, and would stay again. However, we booked at a special 40% off, which made it significantly cheaper than other hotels in a comparable location. Most of those include a fridge, balcony, same-building parking, larger TV, and fitness center. At full price, Moda would be hard pressed to compete with them. Review #53:Hotel is cute, service great, wine bar great but holy hell this was the loudest hotel that we have ever stayed in. I can't even express how awful it was to sleep there. We did not sleep at all. A lot of the other guests seemed to be partying late into the night. On Wed or Thursday night there was such commotion of drunk people fighting in the hallway and girls crying and everytime I peeked my headout the security guard that was addressing the situation would yell at me to get back in our room. I think that went on for over three hours. I would never stay here again which is unfortunate because it's such a cute place, with nice staff and a reasonable price. Review #54:I visit Vancouver once a month, I've stayed in all the Fairmonts and other hotels. However the outstanding Service the cleanness, of this beautiful European boutique Hotel in the downtown core is truly an amazing Experience ! I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Vancouver. The rooms are better then most of the 5 star hotels I've been in. The Staff are incredibly friendly and extremely helpful, the manager personally asks if there is anything he could do to make your stay better. All my friends visiting Vancouver also choose Moda hotel as their hotel of choice. and everyone keeps going back. I travel all around the world throughout the year and I stay in alot of hotels, but this Boutique Hotel is a hidden Gem in Vancouver and is Truly an amazing Experience! Brian Review #55:Staff were accomodating..Modern decor, very clean and in the middle of everything you want to get to.. Price was excellant for Vancouver.. Cibo Resturant, Wine Bar ( attached to lobby) was also a great and yummy experience.. Price was good for the delicious gourmet meal.. I would stay here again.. Felt safe with the security of hotel during the riots of the Hockey games near hotel. Cheers to Yvonna (reception)-Betty (maid), and Alan (Conceirge).. Review #56:Staff very polite, helpful and efficient. Comfortable bed and room. Location is within walking distance of many attractions and public transportaion. Drawback is that it's on a busy intersection so there may be street noises even with double windows and shades. Also there is noise on the backside with AC or restaurant exhaust fans. Review #57:My husband and I had a Travelzoo voucher that included a great rate at Moda Hotel with a breakfast voucher. The hotel itself is in a great area with many bars and restaurants around it and easy access to downtown. We were not going to be able to use our breakfast voucher as we would be leaving before the restaurant was open in the morning (7:00 a.m.) Management let us use our coupons in the evening. I found that gesture to be very accommodating. The room was small but had everything you could want, was very clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The elevator was slow, but since we had very little luggage, we just took the stairs. We would absolutely stay here again. Review #58:Staff was great - hotel is special. Old character building, new amenities - great combo. Room very clean and tidy - loved the 'red wall' in the room. Pub is now closed - had no problems with noise. Hotel is downtown so you will experience 'street' noise but nothing excessive. Walking distance to Yaletown (amazing restaurants) and Robson Street shops. A bit of a longer walk to Stanley Park but worth it. Cheap rates...worth a try! Review #59:The Good: Spacious room, Full bath, Modern decor. Friendly weekend concierge. Close to almost everything. The Bad: No breakfast, No room service, No fridge, Disinterested staff. Lots of road noise, especially on Friday and Saturday nights (even on the 4th floor). The Ugly: Very thin walls and Very amorous neighbours! Review #60:I had to extend my stay by 2 days to finish my business in Vancouver. Fortunately, I was done in a day. Ivanka at the front desk was extremely helpful and refunded me for the extra day. Very nice and modern hotel in the heart of the city. I loved it. Review #61:I stayed in this hotel for the first time while on a business trip to Vancouver. I was very impressed with the location, the decor, cleanliness and the friendly staff. The value for money was also great. The rooms are smallish but very modern, clean and neat. The only slight area of concern would be if you were to stay in a room facing the street, it can be a little noisey, but only if you have your window open. There is a nice restaurant next door on one side and a lovely wine bar on the other side on the corner. I met a friend and we went into the wine bar for a couple and was very impressed. I will definately stay here when visiting Vancouver again. Review #62:Since I've never been to Vancouver before I wasn't very familiar with the city. After reading reviews of Moda, I thought perhaps I could overlook others saying it was noisy. What I forgot about was the possibility of the temperature rising while we were there. Moda does not have air conditioning. Our choice was either hear the constant construction (inescapable in Vancouver currently or maybe always? )/ air conditioning from a nearby building/dumpster being emptied about 50 times at 7a or risk suffocating in our room with the windows closed. After a combined 4 hours of sleep, we decided to check out early and head to another hotel with air and higher floors. It was a wise decision since this was our vacation and it would be a shame if we spent 2 more sleepless nights. I did not leave angry. This was not Moda's \"fault\". The service otherwise was wonderful. Front Desk agents were super friendly. I would consider staying there again, just not in the summer. Although I think there are better rooms for just a little bit more/night. Review #63:I've stayed here twice now and have enjoyed the hotel so much that I just booked another stay for the end of this month. Considering the location I don't think you can find a better value in Vancouver. The front desk and housekeeping staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but comfortable and clean. What more could you need?! Moda Hotel has quickly become my home base when I'm in town for a concert at the Orpheum or Commodore Ballroom. My only complaint is that whoever looks after their email correspondence isn't terribly concerned with replying to inquiries. Ever. I made a couple of attempts to contact the hotel via email but never received a response. Obviously this hasn't deterred me in the slightest - if I really needed my question answered I could have called - it's just a minor annoyance. Review #64:I was thoroughly disappointed with many aspects of this hotel. I stayed in a suite which I thought was quite small. The suite was nicely designed, but it's an old creaky building and the floor in my room was uneven. I was escorted into the room by the front desk staff \"because the key card doesn't work many times\" (is what he explained to me). When I got to the room the temperature was only 14 degrees celsius and the window was open. It was noticeably cold as soon as you walked in, but the front desk staff said nothing. I cranked the heat but took forever to heat up. This must be a common problem because there was a portable electric heater in the room. Being a suite, the heater was too small to heat the room. Next morning I plugged in the iron and must have popped a breaker because the electricy for the entire room shut down. When I went down to check out and the front desk girl asked how my stay was. I told her about the heat issue and she barely apologized. I will never stay hear again. If I felt the staff was truly apologetic about the situation, I would give this hotel a second chance, but unfortunately that was not the case. Review #65:Easy access from the airport via Skytrain, a good place to stay whilst visiting the city, with most attractions/places of interest within easy walking distance. Overall it doesn't quite live up too the 4* standard, with the rooms being on the small side and walls being thin enabling other guests to be heard. The restaurant, wine bar & pub are all top notch and well worth a visit although no breakfast was available during our visit. The staff were courteous, approachable and well informed. Review #66:We wanted to stay in a place that was close to everything in Vancouver, and we usually stay in a place that has breakfast available in the morning. Though the room was small and kept the character of the 100 year old building, it was comfortable, nicely updated, and VERY clean! It had many of the things a new construction hotel would have including wifi, an electronic safe, flat screen tv, coffee, iron/board, and drier. There was also plent of lighting in the room which is sometimes hard to find in a hotel. The one thing I'd like to see more of is outlets. This is a very tech/business friendly hotel, but there were only 2 reachable outlets in our room (1 in the room and 1 in the bathroom). There were more behind the bed (I assume because the lamp cords went there), but not really available for use. Review #67:This hotel is in a great location for downtown and the cocktail and sportsbar within the same building are great, even if they are very expensive. Decor is quite modern, and maybe a little tattered around the edges. Staff are friendly and helpful. No breakfast on offer. Wifi connection poor and slow. The main problem with this hotel is that it's not a great place to sleep if you want to sleep. Paper thin walls and no noise insulation between floors means you can hear things going on in other rooms. Can be entertaining to an extent, but not when trying to sleep. Furthermore, some rooms have wood flooring which creates a huge amount of noise for the rooms below. And if you do decide to give this place a go, I strongly advise not staying in rooms near the elevator or stairwell...they are really noisy. Review #68:We had a great experience at Moda hotel last weekend. My boyfriend and I wanted to be right in the downtown action and the location was truly perfect. We got a room on the 4th floor and it was surprisingly quiet- I live in the city myself so I was prepared for some street noise. As others have noticed, the staff is very helpful and truly seem to enjoy their jobs. While the rooms are small, they are well designed for two people. The hotel itself is quite unique and you will enjoy the fun room accents. They have the parking situation well handled as well so that makes being downtown less stressful if you have a car. You can just park and leave it for the duration of your visit and walk to restaurants, bars, sightseeing etc. On our last day, they were nice enough to allow us to park after we checked out! I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to others. Thanks for a great experience, Moda Hotel! Review #69:The front desk staff were outstanding, genuinely helpful and warm -- a happy medium between the forced friendliness you get at some chain hotels and the uncomfortable intimacy of some B&Bs. It was our first time in Vancouver, and our impression of the entertainment district downtown was a little gritty. Not dangerous or unpleasant, just gritty. The Moda and its adjoining restaurant, wine bar, espresso bar (delicious breakfast! ), sports bar and wine shop are a classy contrast. That said, the hotel is not shiny and perfect. It's an old building that has been beautifully renovated but still suffers from persnickety heating, electrical and plumbing issues, as evidenced by the many workmen with whom we shared elevator rides and the apologetic explanation, on check-in, of how to work around the (minor) heat and lighting quirks of our room. The Moda is more of a grande dame than a Botox bombshell, and I like that. Review #70:We booked the hotel for one night via Hotwire, which I was not very pleased with, since based on the past reviews, I would not have chosen to stay in this hotel myself. However, since we are only there for one night, I thought we should go with an open mind. The parking for the hotel is in a seperate building, and is not connected to the hotel lobby. It was quite inconvenient for us since we had four luggages with us, and it was an hassle to find a parking spot outside the hotel to unload the luggage since the roads were very busy and there was no on-street parking outside the hotel. The staff was nice enough to come out and help with our luggage. The room was very small and the walls were very thin, and the windows were not double glazed so the traffic noise was very distracting. It did not help that we were sandwiched between 2 occupied rooms, so we can hear the bathroom tabs and toilet flashes from one room, and other guests arguing in the other room. The noisy guests were shouting and screaming after a night out at 1.30am, and you can pratically hear their arguments in our room, which was not very pleasant. Overall, this hotel was very bad value for money even for \u00a350 a night, i have stayed in better hotels in Vancouver for similar price or slightly more. Review #71:So that we get the positives straight here - this is a charming hotel in a fantastic location. Downtown Vancouver, just a few blocks from BC Place, two blocks from the train. Restaurants, bars, convenience stores, theatres right outside the door. The service was also very sincere - there was some inhibition from a language barrier, but effort goes a long way. I saw some reviews that the hotel smelled funny. This is true. I did not find it offensive, but it is there. The elevators are, uh, intimate. I only used them once. No big deal. Stairs are good (though you might strongly consider whether or not you agree here). The worst thing about the hotel is the bed. The bathroom floor was roughly as soft. As much as I liked the hotel and the location, a hotel is ultimately somewhere to sleep, and the bed just did not suit me. Review #72:Had booked to stay in this hotel last week (July 2011). Upon arriving, was informed that the booking had been upgraded to a \"Suite across the Street\". The front desk was quite disorganised, but after some wait time, the clerk walked outside the door, pointed across the street (at a door i couldn't really see) and commented that the room was \"over there\". Making my way across the street, with suitcases, i discovered that the hotel had added a few rooms into a local carpark!! (the elevator is actually labelled Parkade). As a result, the rooms have no hotel presence (not the most secure feeling), no sound proofing and they resemble hostel style accommodation eg the shower forms part of the room, so much that you can see the shower head from the bed! Needless to say, this level of accommodation did not meet my expectations. In fairness to hotel management, they refunded the full cost of the accommodation upon this being explained to them. The Manager noted that the rooms offered \"European style\" accommodation. However, having stayed in many many hotels across the world, including Europe...this couldn't be further from the truth. If Management wish to continue to provide this cheap style of accommodation, they should lower their prices to Hostel equivalent prices. Review #73:I usually have no trouble writing a review for a hotel, my wife and I either love them or hate them...this hotel is the exception...we aren't really sure how we feel about it. We only spent one night in the hotel following our cruise; the next day we flew home. The hotel's decor was nice until you looked at the details. It wanted to be modern, but felt dated. Not really sure how to describe it, usually you can identify what doesn't feel right but with this hotel I couldn't. The street noise was loud, but we live in downtown DC, so the noise didn't bother us. But the windows seemed old and wouldn't open properly. The hallway carpeting and design seemed dated. The layout of the rooms was a standard hotel room, so that definitely was not modern, but the color scheme and furniture was...but looked worn. I guess they were trying too hard to be modern...not sure. Everyone has their personal tastes and this hotel didn't seem to \"feel\" right to us. For others it might be wonderful and perfect, but for us it seemed to lack in the details of what you would expect in a \"modern\" hotel. I wouldn't advise staying there but I wouldn't say not to. It does have a good location though. Review #74:I stayed at the Moda Hotel in May while waiting to go sailing the next day. I found the rooms clean, well stocked, and comfortable and the front desk staff very helpful. Exactly what I was hoping to get. The value for money is very good. Review #75:We booked it on line and requested that we get a corner suite. We were very pleased at the size of the room, the price and the location. The room had the original hardwood floor, comfortable bed, loads of hot water, and surprising quiet given that we were downtown. We highly recommend it! Also offered free parking which is a bonus downtown Vancouver Review #76:I can highly recommend the hotel. The location is excellent - walking distance from shopping and going-out area. Rooms are not as small as I expected from previous reviews, I found the room perfectly fine and stayed in smaller rooms in boutique hotels - but they are probably smaller by North American standards. With modern furniture, great colors, flat screen etc the place has a stylish feel and (despite being not very expensive) does not have a boutique-hotel-on the-cheap feel. Only negative I found was that there is no air conditioning and the heating is controlled for the whole floor. When we arrived the room was somewhat cold, but then they put the heating up and it was no problem. Windows can be opened which is a plus. Regarding noise - we had a room to the back and it was okay. However, windows are not double-glazed and I imagine rooms to the main road can be noisy. All in all I think the place is a real find, given the price it is a top tip. Review #77:I stayed at Moda Hotel for 3 nights and I just loved it. Not only was the staff extremely friendly and helpful, making sure that I enjoyed my stay to the fullest. The room was also stylishly furnished and very quiet, given the central location. (I'm very noise-sensitive and asked for a quiet room when making my reservation - I got one!) Great breakfast at the restaurant next door gets you started for the day. Should I have another opportunity to visit Vancouver, this will be my place to stay. Review #78:Great location,great price my husband and I stayed during Grey Cup 2011..The location was great for all the venues and for the game. Shopping was walking distance for me as well. The staff was great the room was on the small size but we didn't spend much time in it . I agree with (Charmsy) afridge in the room would have been great. We would stay again for the location and the price.. Review #79:First thing was the room was not ready,it was suppose to be ready at 3:00 but not ready till after 3:30. Had to wait in the TINY lobby.Then the air conditioner was off for the season,no central air.Windows were wide open letting in the street noise,closing them did not help with the noise(they supplied ear plugs but they would not stay in and only 1pair.) Only had queen size bed available.Had to search for a place to plug in the coffee maker. There was only 1 tiny sliver of soap to use. Oh yes there was no place to stop and unload your luggage.The staff was outstanding though. Review #80:This hotel is a quaint boutique hotel in a great centralized location. The front desk staff is friendly and always willing to help. While not on the cutting edge of design, the rooms have plenty of space and a touch of style with a pop of color and great photographs as artwork. The rooms are clean and there's an in-room temperature control. I would definitely stay here again. Review #81:Just spent 2 nights at the Moda. Saturday night was sleepless, the drunks on the street may as well have been in our room. Should have paid more attention to the reviews. Would possibly stay there again if I had an interior or rear facing room. Rooms nicely decorated and very clean, although it would seem that there is no air-cond. Staff very nice & helpful. Will be opening an adjoining restaurant soon. There is a wine bar next door that was nice. Didn't move the car the whole time, lots to see on foot. Review #82:We started the evening with fun, laughter and champagne...celebrating mine and my boyfriends birthdays. We then hoped in a cab to surprise him with a stay at the Moda Hotel, and he was more than excited. We had wanted to rent the restaurant beside it for our birthdays, so I knew it was his spot of choice. I let the staff know it was our birthdays and they provided a bottle of sparkling wine free of charge! That was amazing, since we didn't feel we had enough champagne already :p! The bed and bathroom were gorgeous, and the view was of the passerby's on Smithe and Seymour. We felt like tourists in our own city! Thanks Moda! Review #83:I am usually not one to write negative reviews, but I felt I could not with good conscious let fellow travelers stay here without being warned. The parking garage for this hotel is across the street, in a building currently under construction. Upon arrival, the front desk told us to empty our car of all valuables, good advice for anyone. It seems they were aware there had been a rash of break ins, but were not doing anything about it except to give a general warning and disclaimer they would not be liable. That night three cars belonging to hotel guests were broken into. Apparently the building security guard didn't hear any of the three alarms go off, or was too lazy to do anything about it. None of the hotel staff seemed surprised, and one told me that this happens quite frequently. And trust me, it is not easy to get a window replaced through an American insurance company while your in Canada. As to the hotel itself, it was very forgettable. The rooms are pretty small, the beds not very comfortable, and generally disappointing. I thought this would be a nice alternative to a chain hotel, as the pictures and descriptions made it look like a stylish, modern boutique hotel. Instead it was slightly dingy, pretty uncomfortable, and very disappointing. Review #84:Our room was small, clean, charming and we loved it. Our king size bed was a little hard and took over most of the room but that was okay. We had a corner room, and was bigger than most of the other hotel rooms. We over looked the intersection, it was a little noisey but it never bothered us nor did it take away from the stay. After the first night we didn't even notice any outside noise from street. The room was nicely renovated and the cleaning staff did an amazing job. My only complaint was the Blue haze in the hallway from some other guest. The hotel did try to deal with this and was only noticeable late at night. This is a young and hip hotel in the heart of the entertainment district. If you are expecting anything else you have booked the wrong hotel for your stay. The hotel staff was great, friendly and helpful. I would stay here again. Review #85:We stayed at the Moda Hotel for 4 nights in June. Our room was facing the street and was extremely noisy. The weekend was especially so and were woken up by people screaming, fire engines, police car sirens etc all night. The noise is the only real downside, the size of the room wasn't massive but was ok, the decor was gorgeous and the rooms were clean. The reception staff also seemed very friendly and helpful. The main plus was the location, two minutes walk from Robson Street for some retail therapy and only ten minutes walk to Gastown. If location is your number one priority then this is the hotel for you. If a good nights sleep is then you may want to reconsider. Review #86:The hotel is located in the heart of downtown at a convenient location near restaurants, bars, and shopping. Parking available at adjacent garage for reasonable hotel rate of $14/nt with in/out priveleges. Rooms are clean and modern, with free internet. The staff is also very welcoming and friendly. Overall, this is a place that I would recommend to others. Review #87:I've stayed at the Moda hotel for a few nights in April on a business, and I can say it was great stay for the value. Rooms were clean with comfortable beds. I liked how they decorated rooms and the lobby. Front desk staff - very helpful and professional. Considering that hotel does not have it's own parking, but they offer the discounted rate at the parking across the street, was also a good deal. I was satisified to learn that the internet access was free. All in all, I had a great stay, and I would stay at the Moda again. Review #88:Staying at this hotel is like staying at a re-marketed motel 6. It's not worth the price and it's not as the pictures portray. I would NOT recommend thud hotel. We were si disappointed we checked out early.... This is were the great customer service comes into play. Not only were they flexible with the lady minute cancelation but they also did not charge me a cancelation fee. If they could only update/remodel their rooms they would have a wonderful hotel. Review #89:great city atmosphere we stayed here 2 nights for our first visit to vancouver. overall, the hotel had wonderful modern decor and very helpful/friendly staff. the room was very clean but a bit noisy because we were facing the side of the street with construction. It was a bit stuffy/hot because there is no air conditioning but it did have a nice fan that was sufficient. this hotel seems ideally situation if you are interesting in seeing a concert at the orpheum or going out to the bars. next time i would prefer to stay some place a little bit closer to the seawall/down by the bay, if possible. Note: it was only a short walk to everything and we never had to use the car to get around town. Overall, it was a great city and a great hotel for the price just not my exact preferred location. Although please note the hotel itself was located on a very clean/safe street at least one city block away from the noisy bar area. Review #90:The service here is great, we were walked to the parkade, given visual instructions on how to open the gate and then were walked to our room to ensure we had no problems with our keys! The hotel was perfect walking distance to rogers arena! The room was clean, warm and private. The hotel, room and service were great! Definitely staying at The Moda on our next trip to Vancouver! Review #91:After reading all of the negative reviews about the loud noise, my wife and I took a gamble with this place. We honestly were sold with the special package for Washington state residents ($99/night with free parking in a secure, gated garage...not bad!). We were reassured by the staff that sound proofing would be completed by the time of our arrival. Regardless, we packed our ear plugs just to be safe. I have to say, we were pleasantly surprised. We were in a corner room on the third floor. The street noise was barely audible. You do get some noise from the hallway, but it was mostly negligible. The room was clean and well decorated. The bed was nice and firm with comfy pillows. The sheets were a bit stiff, but we got used to them pretty quickly. The bathroom was well stocked with Skoah products, a local (~5-7 min walk) Vancouver body care shop. A DVD player would be a nice touch. I also wish there was a micro/fridge combo for all of our wonderful leftovers. The staff was pleasant and very accommodating. They gladly held our bags and extended our free parking for several more hours after check out. Big brownie points in my opinion. The location can't be beat. You are in very close proximity to any number of bars, clubs, shops, and restaurants. We took a few Frommer walking tours and they all started within a few blocks from the hotel. Don't bother with the overpriced restaurants located on the street level of the hotel. There are much better places nearby. Next time we're in Vancouver, we'll definitely consider staying here again. Bravo, Moda Hotel! Review #92:I've stayed at the Moda on several occasions now. This time I booked a suite in order to hold a series of meetings, and it worked out really well. We made use of the onsite restaurants as well, though I find them a bit on the pricy side. I've always found the staff to be helpful, and I am always greeted with a smile. People complain about the noise, etc., but the hotel is in the middle of a busy part of the city... Review #93:My wife and I, along with another couple, stayed at the Moda while in Vancouver the night before our plane departed Canada. We were drawn in by the relatively low price compared to other hotels in the area. The pictures made the hotel seem very modern and trendy. After staying there I would say that it is more boutique than modern, but overall we were pleased with our stay. The Moda is located in a more upscale area of downtown Vancouver and away from a lot of the other tourist hotels (also away from the tourist attractions). We enjoyed not having to walk more than a few blocks to restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. The area felt safe even late into the evening and had a lot of pedestrian traffic. Our room was basic, but really all we were looking for was a place to sleep since we had planned to be out and about in Vancouver. Many other reviews mention how loud the hotel was, but we didn't find this to be the case. Being and older, renovated hotel you could hear water from other rooms and doors closing in the hallway, but it wasn't any worse than other hotels. The room had double glass windows, both of which could be opened, to help buffer the outside noise. Basically, if you're looking for a plush, trendy place to stay in Vancouver the Moda probably isn't the best fit. But, if you want a unique hotel and a good area, with a decent price, it's a good choice in our opinion. Review #94:My husband and I stayed there for our second time this past weekend. We have stayed in a suite both times, and find that they have done a good job of refurbishing an old building. However, there are too many little things that stop me from giving this a good rating. First is the parking. The only place to park is a grungy parkade across the street. They do not give you easily-found instruction on their website regarding their own parking arrangement in this parkade. Even with instruction, it is quite a hassle. You must first check in in order to get access to their section. Which means that you must somehow park your vehicle somewhere first in order to check in. There is no valet parking, which poses a problem because they are also situated on a busy street. Thus, you cannot just pull up in front of the hotel and park for a few minutes while you hop out and check in. It's extremely inconvenient. When I mentioned this to the lady who checked us in, her attitude was nothing short of rude. I had to tell her to watch her tone, which then got us the cold shoulder and even more attitude while she checked us in. She was no warmer the following day. We also discovered how cold this old building was. The in-room heating didn't seem to work, which might have explained the two portable heaters that were in our room. It's just not quite \"there\" yet. Review #95:I found the hotel staff super friendly, and location was really nice. However, I could NOT get shut-eye from the street sound mixed with the paper thin walls. Also, the elevator only holds 2 people with luggage, and there is only one. I just think for the price, I'd rather stay up the street at the l'Hermitage hotel and get much more modern comforts and updated hotel. Review #96:Mixed reviews for the Moda but the unfailing help and courteous attention I got from the staff made my visit special.These folks were great and put up with my confused laptop WiFi use without complaint. In fact the hotel was still awaiting a/c when I stayed but temperatures were comfortable. The rooms showed recent renovation and were excellent value for a mid priced intown hotel. I would advise checking on parking if you are driving because there is no way to stop out front without attracting an angry bus!! And the one way system can make for a nervous arrival to say the least. So do ask. When I was there parking was 100 yards away underground and the staff will urge you to immediately bring everything of value as you check in. Makes it sound worse than it really is...this is a decent area. There is no getting away from the fact that traffic noise thru the night is loud, even on the 4th floor. This ia very intown city and sirens, motor bikes and road racing engine gunners do make for interesting sleep. So if traffic is going to bother you this may not be the place....but if you want great people to help you look no further Review #97:The room was in a great location. We were able to walk all over the city. The bed was really comfy - the soap in the room was fabulous. If they had room service, it would have been perfect. This hotel would not be good if you want peace and quiet. At about 3AM, there was a \"drunk driver\" bust right outside of our window. We had just gotten home ourselves (walking, not driving! ), and it was pure entertainment to watch. I probably would have been annoyed if I had been sleeping, but it was a great place to crash if you want to go out in downtown Vancouver. Review #98:This hotel is perfect--great location (to Robson shopping/museums, Yaletown restaurants, etc. ), great staff (helpful with tips on how to navigate buses, etc. ), & stylish room (with wall photography of local sites that actually were beautiful, great decor--also clean with great size). I had read on-line that some found it noisy; so, I emailed a request for a quiet room. We had a wonderful corner room on the 4th floor. Review #99:Trendy, affordable and wonderfully located describe the Moda Hotel. The one problem (and it\u2019s huge) is the noise. The building is not well insulated and you can hear virtually every noise from outside, other rooms and the hallways. We stayed two nights and the first night we were awoken at around 1 am by what sounded like a rowdy group of bachelorettes in the hallway outside our door, yelling for about a half hour. At 2 am and then again at 3 am, we could clearly hear the obnoxious conversations from the people down below on the street. Also around 6 am (the second morning) the maids started cleaning the rooms surrounding us. In total both nights we probably got six hours of sleep. If you are in serious party mode this is the place for you!", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

We found that it was cheaper staying in downtown Vancouver at a quality hotel than by the airport. Because the new Canada Line runs from downtown to the airport in less than 30 minutes for only $2.50 after 6 and weekends, it's actually easier than waiting for airport hotel shuttles. We paid $70 a night on Priceline for the Renaissance and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We were there during the last weekend of the Paralympics and yet check-in was quick and the room assigned was roomy and comfortable. Unfortunately, I am a light sleeper and the first room was on a floor with noisy young people running between rooms. However, we quickly got another room without any argument and were told that if we were not happy with it, they would find us a room that would make us happy. It turns out that the second room was behind the elevator shaft so.....we were cheerfully given a third room. Luckily, the third room was quiet and comfortable. Five stars for the front-desk's cheerful and \"make-right\" attitude. Other so-called 4 star hotels should learn from this attitude. Review #1:We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in a 17th-floor room facing the harbour. Check-in was quick and efficient, the room well maintained and clean. Our request for foam pillows was promptly fulfilled. As mentioned in other reviews, there is construction in front of the hotel, and seaplanes start and land frequently after 7:30am on weekdays. While the extra windows on the balcony do a pretty good job of minimizing the noise I would recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper and if you are planning to sleep in. Once you get up, a terrific breakfast buffet awaits you. We managed to get an excellent rate and really enjoyed our stay. Review #2:The hotel offers beautiful views of the waterfront and the rooms are spacious and relatively modern. I found the staff to be less than friendly and not very accomodating, particluarly the staff in the restaurant. If traveling for business, this hotel is not a great option. Lack of a business center is problematic if you need to print anything. Hotel turned former business center into a small shop leaving guests forced to share two computers and one printer located in the lobby - which means you are often waiting on someone to finish checking email. Review #3:My wife and I stayed here for a quick weekend getaway. Considering the great deal we got through Priceline, the hotel was excellent. We arrived three hours early, and when I asked them if they could check our baggage in so we could tour around Vancouver, they did us one better and got us room without delay. The common areas were very clean and well-appointed. Where the hotel loses clout with me is in the size of the rooms. For a four-star, it seemed the rooms were very small, and the bathroom was downright claustrophobic. The bed was very comfortable, though, and television programming was plentiful (which was nice when we were taking a break from walking around town). In-room coffee was very good. If you want Internet, it is nearly $16 CAD per day! Which was tough, because I had to do some work. To summarize, though, the hotel was excellent for the Priceline bid we put in. I would have been less thrilled if we paid the off-the-rack rate of $170-200, given how small the rooms are. Review #4:The rooms are good, the service is good, and the prices are reasonable. I decided to choose this hotel following previous reviews on trip advisor, and I wasn't disappointed. I would recommend this hotel to my friends. Vancouver is a really nice city, and this hotel is pretty well located. Review #5:I've stayed at this hotel twice. First time I had a city view, which was nice. Second time I had a harborview. Nice to look out and see the seaplanes land. With the construction across the street, the water view is partially blocked. Both rooms have great beds and nice linens. Wallpaper is an odd blue star patern, but oh well. None of the interior seemed to be the same (wallpaper, chairs, curtains, etc but the bedding was the simple white). Didn't eat at the hotel. Pool area is nice. I would stay there again. Review #6:My husband and I booked this through priceline, thinking we'd be staying at a four star hotel. We were certainly impressed with the name, delighted by the deal and looked forward to the location. Upon arrival, the lobby was chaos with luggage strewn everywhere for a Coors Light/Maxim event...it felt like a frat house. Reception was chilly and the only time the desk clerk smiled was when she offered us a room with a water view for an extra $30 per night. Seriously? We went to our room to freshen up and were nonplussed. It was fine, but certainly not four star. The chaise lounge was stained, the desk was dusty and the bathroom was cramped at best. We took off to see the sights and returned later that evening to get ready for bed. Well...we didn't notice this during daylight hours, but upon closing our room door and dimming the lights, we noticed that we could see clearly into the hallway via spaces between the door and doorjamb. Not just light, but actual people passing by! On all four sides! If that wasn't enough, this also allowed quite a bit of sound to travel through to our room, and we heard every step, cough, door click, etc. all night long. We were SO disappointed! Good thing it was only one night! Review #7:Booked a great rate through one of the bidding services. When we arrived, they initially gave us a room directly above a band playing for a special event, right next to the swimming pool entrance - however, when we complained, we were promptly given a room higher up. Excellent attitude by the staff, good amenities (pool, workout facility, restaurant, and parking on the premises), and a clean room all added up to a great stay. Could walk to Robson Street. Wish they had a fan in the bathroom. Review #8:We arrived at 8am, following an early morning departure from an Alaskan cruise, given a warm welcome by the receptionist and advised our room was ready. Great to be able to relax for a couple of hours before exploring Vancouver. All the staff very helpful and efficient. An excellent location for downtown Vancouver and the harbour. Excellent stay. Review #9:The view from our room in the Renaissance overlooked Coal Harbor and Stanley Park. We enjoyed watching the seaplanes take off and the various water traffic. Far off we could see the mountains. Our room had the classic Renaissance features and quality. The breakfast was worth getting up early for. Wished we could have stayed longer. Review #10:Very nice view from our hotel room afforded us the colors of sunrise set against the majesty of a mountain range to and the goings on of a bustling sailplane business. We are Marriott concierge members so were able to avail ourselves of the 19th floor Concierge Lounge. Very nice hosts up there and when we did dine at the main level buffet it was also pleasant. Room is somewhat dated, but very clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed the complimentary jogging maps -a nice touch. Review #11:Very pleasant and helpful check-in. We had the room via Priceline but there were no knowing looks or comments we sometimes get when we have booked using the P/Line bidding system. We had a beautiful 16th floor room facing the front of the hotel. Window opened okay and there was very little noise from the street. Well appointed room, complete with safe. One thing we did notice was that there was only one bath/handtowel/facecloth per person. Not a big deal as I am sure we could have had extra if we had asked for them and they were very good quality anyway. Bed very comfortable. Room very quiet even though it was an adjoining room and one of the nights there were people in the other room but hardly noticeable. Just as we got to the room there was an emergency announcement over intercom made by the duty Manager advising us not to use elevators and that we would be advised accordingly. Little nerve racking as we were up on the 16th floor and then the emergency vehicles arrived. However, Duty Manager made at least two more announcements keeping us apprised which was reassuring. It was a false alarm but all the staff we very reassuring and helpful. Hotel itself is beautiful very spacey, clean and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Great deal for drinking at the hotel itself as there is a different beer and wine special of $5 each every day. Also, free computer use is available in the lobby. Location was perfect, especially if you don't have your own transport. Hotel is within walking distance to buses, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and all the local attractions. We even walked to Granville Island and though it is a good walk we enjoyed it. Review #12:The hotel is well located close to the harbour, shopping on Robson street and walking distance to Stanley Park. When we checked in we inquired about the fitness facilities as advertised on the web site. We were informed that they were closed for renovation but we could use the facilities at the Marriott accross the street. Had we known this in advance we would have booked our room at the Marriott. Our room was recently renovated, spacious and with a city view. We found the rate for parking to be a little pricey at $21 per day. We went down for breakfast and were seated quickly but ignored for almost ten minutes without being offered coffee. The breakfast buffet had limited selection and was overpriced. When I asked for a newspaper they informed I would have to go accross the street to get one at the gift shop in the Marriott. There are lots of choices of hotels in this price range in this area of Vancouver. I would not stay here again. Review #13:One night stay due to the Marriott Pinnacle being fully booked for my last day in Vancouver. Just across the street, so I was at the front desk in seconds. Efficient check in and got my room immediately despite being early, nice room with view of sea. Slightly tired decor, but clean and comfortable. Seems to be more of a tourist hotel than the Pinnacle, lots of coaches so if you are unlucky it could be a long wait to check in. Room rate was very high for the quality of accommodation on offer. But no real complaints. Review #14:Good Location if traveling for business or you have a car! Got this hotel thru a discount travel company and paid $65.00 american a night. Excellent deal at this price. We had a terrific view from the 16th floor. Unfortunetly the view is going to be partly blocked with yet another \"Glass tower\" going in. The room was spacious and clean. No tub in our room. Bed was really hard and needed 4 extra pillows. The TV was not working properly. room felt sort of dated in interior. Hotel itself was very clean and so were the amenities. Front Desk staff very nice. Very unsatisfied with long distance calls to USA. Was told one rate and got billed $$$. check out staff, smiled and said thats the rate. Unacceptable. Woould stay here again in the future. -) Happy New Year! Review #15:This was my first trip to Vancouver and our stay at the Renaissance was the highlight of a wonderful trip. THe view of the harbor was to die for!!! It was heavenly waking up to such an amazing view of the water and turning in with a lovely view of the sparkling city across the way. Each day we would return to the hotel after hours of sight seeing and the view was so breathtaking I think would have been perfectly content watching the planes land/take off from the water all day long. Besides the view, the bed was absolutely divine. We were in Vancouver in September and it was slightly chilly but the heated floors of the bathroom was a great touch. There is nothing I would change about this hotel or trip. THe staff was very polite and helpful, esp in organizing one of our excursions to Victoria Island. We definitely stay here again. Review #16:I must start out by saying that the staff at this hotel is awesome! The hotel itself is VERY tired and the guest rooms and hallways need desperately to be updated. The very obviously updated lobby and bar area is beautiful. There were long black hairs stuck to the ceiling in the bathroom that remained my entire 6 night stay - and what appeared to be a pubic hair on the side of the bath tub when we checked in (which I removed myself.....ewww) The food in the lounge is pretty good and again, the service outstanding. would not go back to this hotel. Review #17:I booked this hotel through Priceline for $64 a night. What a great deal! The hotel appears to be recently renovated and everything worked out well. I saw that some people were complaining about the cost of parking or the internet, but if they had a clue about anything, they would know that all of the comparable hotels in Vancouver charge the same prices. (Hyatt, Delta, Marriott, Sheraton) and I have stayed at all of them. This hotel is right there in the same class. My complaint would be that the hot tub is tiny, there was a family in there so we went back to our room watched a movie instead. The gym was big though. Also there was an alarm that went off in one of the rooms for 45mins, we called down and someone came up to switch it off within 5minutes. Review #18:It is a good thing I booked this hotel through priceline at a discounted rate, the quality and service we received for this hotel was not even on par with a two star hotel. Even with the discount in mind, for what we paid I was still quite disappointed. First of all - this was a weekend girls getaway for two working professional women who wanted to visit the city and pamper ourselves (at least a little bit.) I saw on the website that this property had a pool and jacuzzi open 24 hours as well as a sauna. The Jacuzzi was closed for cleaning, and then was out of order for the entire weekend. We were ok with this as we thought to just use the sauna - There is none! The website falsely advertises this feature (amongst others). I was told by a hotel staff who was laughing that it was \"not replaced when the hotel was renovated\"..IN 2008!!!!! I don't think it takes 2+ years to change details on the website. There were blood stains on my sheet and the balcony was filthy. I met the housekeeper of our floor and she was so lovely and sweet, the attention to detail of these issues was likely an oversight as the result of being allotted to many rooms to clean. The decor is best described as \"confused\". It is modern minimalism meets country western/Mediterranean. The hotel doorman was very gracious, the beds were ok and the location was near a skytrain station. These are only the good qualities this hotel has to offer. Like I said. Stay at a two star hotel and save your pennies. Why exactly is this hotel considered a four star luxury hotel anyways? They even charge for internet. Review #19:Stayed here on Dec 3, 2008. This is a nice Renaissance with harbor views. I booked a harbor view room and was given a lovely corner room on trhe 8th floor. While the hotel is not right on the water (there are a few condo buildings closer to the water) I was still able to have a nice view. The workout room was under repair during my stay, but they let guests use the Marriot workout room which is across the street. I can also see why this hotel is popular with cruises since the location is close to the terminal. I didn't eat on site, but do recommend Joe Fortes Seafood and Chop House. Vancouver is beautiful and I can't wait to return in January for my next business trip. Review #20:We had a great harbor view room during our short stay in Vancouver. It was within walking distance of downtown. PROS: 1. Wonderful view with early check in 2. Ease of navigating the city, dinner reservations 3. The bellman rapid and courteous service 4. The service from the waiter for the wonderful breakfast buffet. CONS: None Review #21:First, the view was extraordinary. There is construction blocking part of the view, but staying in one of the western-most rooms still gives you a terrific field of view. Rooms -41 and -39 are in the western corner. Enhancing the view, is the fact that there is an enclosed balcony with a couple chairs. You can even open the window and get fresh air. Very nice. Downtown location is great. It's a nice part of town and it's not too far to walk to Robson street, Stanley Park, or along the waterfront. Not too many restaurants in the immediate area, so plan on going somewhere else if you want to eat other than in the hotel. There are nice ammenities to the room, such as the heated bathroom tiles and very comfortable beds. However, the decor is aging somewhat and I expected something fresher. It didn't take away too much from the week-long experience, but kept it from being an excellent room. The new construction does block the Canada Day fireworks completely, which are a little further up Coal Harbour. (Take note for 2008!) Ultimately, I would stay here again. I would hope that the rooms are rennovated before my next visit, but it wouldn't stop me. Review #22:My first visit to Vancouver, British Columbia was exceptional. Upon entering the hotel, we were treated with personalized courtesy from the bell captain to the lobby staff. The front desk lady greeted us by name and went out of her way to accommodate our room preference. The harbour views were breathtaking and exciting. Even though, there was constuction taking place near the harbour it was negligible to the serene water views we experienced. We stayed on the 10th floor on the right side facing the water. The view of the harbour is better toward the right side. The construction is necessary so that city of Vancouver can prepare for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Yes, we definitely would stay here on a return trip! Review #23:Upon arriving in Vancouver, one day prior to our cruise departure, it was apparent that the hotel we had booked was not in a good part of town. Desperation set in and we hopped in a cab and headed back downtown to the Renaissance Vancouver Harbourside Hotel. Upon arriving, a young but very Professional and understanding Miss Amanda Bye listened to our plight and got us into an amazing room at a last minute special rate. She was extremely helpful and kind and in a world of not so great customer service, Miss Bye exceeding all of our expectations and turned a very bad first night in Vancouver into a very good one! The rooms and views are breathtaking, looking out over the harbor, the location is perfect, a few blocks from the Waterfront stop from using the SkyTrain from the airport and it's just a one block walk down to the waterfront itself where there is a plethora of restaurants and yummy eats such as gelato. The staff overall are very accommodating and the buffet breakfast is top notch. I would not hesitate staying here again on our next visit and I would hire Miss Bye in a heartbeat if I owned any type of establishment. Thanks again AMANDA!!! ! Review #24:Renaissance Vancouver Harbourside Hotel The hotel is very nice located, near you will find nice restaurants , delis and one Sven eleven. Our room was fine, and great bed 6 lovely pillows. It was quite and cleans room and has a beautiful view of the harbor (though obstructed by an apartment tower). Bathroom is a small but very clean having Aveda products , the shower was hot and amazing. Globe and Mail was provided in the morning. Breakfast buffet was superb - TONS of fresh fruit and anything else you could want. Quite expensive 26 dollars each. Wi-Fi is crazy expensive at $16 per night... not sure why they charge when the Starbucks around the corner is free. The bathroom is a little small for this type of hotel. Review #25:Stayed here pre-cruise (out of Ballantyne) on points. We walked from the new Canada Line and was a little more of a hike than we thought, but if you are active, it should be fine. Checked in to find that we had a room with gorgeous view of harbor, Stanley Park and a little glimpse of the Lions Gate bridge. Loved the decor in eclectic reds, golds and blacks. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. Had the buffet breakfast in the morning and it was VERY good and the setting was so beautiful. We walked to Granville Island from here (quite a walk) and Stanley Park to rent bikes. Would stay here again in a heart beat! Great way to start a phenomenal vacation. Review #26:I knew that Vancouver wasn't huge, geographically, so I wasn't worried about needing to get to the airport for sidetrips to Calgary, Kelowna and Victoria during my stay. Unfortunately, I hadn't factored in downtown traffic. Because the Harbourside was some distance from the airport, which is actually in Richmond, I found myself at the valet station at 5am three days in a row. The first two days, there was no problem as there was someone on duty each day. The third--a Sunday--a \"suit\" came to the valet station asking what I wanted. I gave him my parking ticket, and explained that I had to catch a plane. He ran off and drove up in five minutes with my rental car. I offered the gentleman a $10 bill which he declined to accept--explaining to me that he was the manager-on-duty of the Harbourside (Whoa!). I realize this is what five-star service is about, but I still worried about finding my luggage on the sidewalk when I returned to the hotel. I also had faxes placed in envelopes and delivered to my room as soon as they arrived--in one case it was the middle of the night. The night before my day of departure, I explained at the valet station that I had to return my rental car and be through airport security and at my international departure gate at 5:30am. A valet jumped into my rental car and drove me into the underground parking garage. He placed my car near an elevator and gave me my keys. I made my plane with time to spare. I know this sounds like I spent more time *outside* the hotel than *inside* to hotel. But the fact is that without the exceptionally high level of service the Harbourside provided, my visit to Vancouver would have been a complete failure. Review #27:This was the first hotel we stayed at during our tour from Vancouver to Calgary. We upgraded our room to the harbour view and it was worth every penny. The views were amazing. Out of all the hotels we stayed at in Canada this was the best. The room was really nice the bed was really comfortable. The only downside of the this hotel is that you have to pay \u00a310 (just like any other city) per night for parking, however if you are staying in Vancouver for a few days, just get a taxi from the airport. During our 4 days in vancouver we only used the car once. There is some building work going on in front of the hotel so I dont know what the views will be like once this has been done. Review #28:I choose this hotel over the newer Marriott which was across the street from the Renaissance because I wanted a harbour view from my room. The view was limited due to a new high-rise being constructed between the hotel and the shoreline. This was not a major upset as we still commanded some pretty nice views but the room was well-worn and outdated. I normally have room service once or twice but the menu was very limited as were the availability of the restaurants in the hotel. We ate at the buffet for breakfast which was pricey for what was offered. Service was very slow if you ordered anything from the kitchen (e.g. an omelet). Also, the overall ambiance of this hotel is 'dark'. I am use to brightly lit lobbies, corridors and rooms. This was not the case here. I would not recommend this hotel given better choices nearby such as the new Marriott across the street. Review #29:Arrived at this hotel as a group on a geology study-tour. Travel-agent had suggested a luxurious hotel for the final night before we flew back to Scotland.. Despite arriving well after 3 p.m. (check-in time) three of the group's rooms were not ready. We were left hanging about the lobby beside the very posh front door - then were shooed out of the way, as we were told we were blocking the door. We could not leave our luggage as there was a great heap of suitcases, obviously from another group about to depart. After twenty minutes two of us went to see if they would at least offer us a drink and somewhere to sit down. At this point, the young man at the desk phoned someone, and then told us that our rooms were ready. No-one apologised for the delay. The next morning a buffet breakfast has been booked for us in a private room - we were due to go on a tour of Vancouver for the rest of the morning, before headng off to the airport. There were thirty-two people in our group. There were chairs and place-settings for only twenty-four. The one and only waitress was hurtling around like a banshee, trying to fill up the buffet dishes, supply people with tea and coffee, find more dishes and cutlery, not to mention chairs. Two young male managers did appear, and stood around looking concerned - but didn't actually DO anything. It was the most frustrating and unsatisfactory meal. We then went up to our rooms to collect our suitcases and got into the lift. One of the older members of our group tried to keep the doors open for another member, but presumably hit the alarm button by mistake.The alarm went off and the lift continued down to the ground floor - and no member of staff came to investigate if there was a problem. When the last member of our party came down, ten minutes later, the alarm was still going off! Review #30:Trailfinders booked us here as part of our Canadian tour before joining a cruise to Alaska and we were very pleased they did. From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely professional and helpful. The rooms are of an excellent size and the view of the harbour is stunning. One way from the hotel you are within easy walking distance of the cruise terminal which is just next to Gastown and the other way is a beautiful walk along the waterfront, past the marina and into Stanley Park. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the concierge very knowledgeable and helpful in organising our trip to Grouse Mountain. Thank you for making our stay most enjoyable! Review #31:I spent the 4th of July weekend with my husband and we had a marvelous time. The room package came with a free companion ticket and free hot breakfast. We arrived late and had dinner at the restaurant, the server was very friendly and attentive to my special needs ( I try to avoid too much sodium when traveling).... The Halibut dinner was excellent and my husband ordered the filet....delicious!! The room initial room was very small, but I realized we were in Canada, but they promptly upgraded us to a harborview room so the large patio window made all the difference...although no chairs available to sit on the balcony..... I would definitely come back when visiting Vancouver again.... Review #32:I was staying here for business. I thought the hotel was very nice. Bed was very comfortable. Gorgeous view of the harbour (what you can see past the towers in front of you anyway) Residential neighbourhood mostly, so quite quiet. Easy to walk to most shopping on Robson and Granville Streets and the liquor store is only a 1/2 block away. Nice to have a glass of wine in my room after work. The heliport is a very short walk. I thought the front door staff on the most part were friendly although a few turned away when I made eye contact to say 'hello'. They have an amazing gym. Really top notch. Gorgeous indoor pool and hot tub too. Only complaint is that there was no signage for the underground parking. Had to go around the block 3 times before I finally found it. Review #33:was here for 3 nights mid- Aug. Great location. Expensive food\u00a0 $23 plus for bacon and eggs?? Booked a 2 bedded assessible room and was told it was confirmed. When we got there I was informed it was either 2 dbl. beds with no assessiblity or 1 with a king bed and a chaise with assessiblity. I chose the king bed (I was with my 82 yr old mom and wheelchair bound sister. There is only enough room in the 'assessible' room to get the wheelchair in. Not enough room to get the chair around the room. The bathroom has grab bars at the toilet and in the shower/tub (if you need a roll in shower you are S.O.L)...Had to call twice for the extra bedding so I could sleep on the chaise . When I asked where a certain restrurant was I was told it just just a few blocks away (it was 8 blocks UP HILL and I was pushing a wheelchair). You get 1 towel per person, some days we had shampoo/conditioner and lotion, other days we had no soap ,1 shampoo and 2 lotions. The bed\u00a0 I was told was comfortable. I was woken up one night at 3am from the alarm clock in some other room. If you are not on the harbor side you get street noise till 2am. Review #34:If business or vacation takes you to the heart of Vancouver the Renaissance Vancouver Hotel Harbourside certainly is a great choice. I got to play tourist for 2 days while my wife attended business meetings. Book a waterside room for a nice view of the north shore of Burrard Inlet, Coal Harbour, mountians, ship traffic, float planes, Stanley Park, etc. Parking garage was $19 a day (ouch). The staff we encountered generally displayed excellent customer service skills (okay, a couple of them registered low in the smile catagory). I am fairly certain that Alexandra at the concierge desk speaks spanish, portuguese & Italian in addition to english. They graciously pointed me to the best bus to Chinatown (it's the #19), the nearest Skytrain station and the Steam Clock in Gastown...yes I said Steam Clock. Oh, just go see it. Public transit is great. Didn't dine at the hotel restaurant. Found breakfast and lunch at cafe's in Chinatown, downtown and Granville Island. Had dinner one night at Joe Fortes on Thurlow St. and the next night at Cardero's Restaurant & Marine Pub on Coal Harbour Quay. Both an easy walk from the hotel. Joe Fortes ain't no Outback Steakhouse, it's a very pleasant restaurant and, dining solo, my dinner bill came to about $40. Life's too short for bad food. Cardero's is a bit noisy but great atmosphere with very good pub-style food. If you're driving into Vancouver remember that there is no expressway to whisk you quickly and effortlessly to downtown. Finding your way should be easy, but you are on surface streets and they can be slow. If you are feeling \"touristy\" go ahead and see Granville island. Plenty of shops, stores, galleries and food stands, plus the public market to entertain you. The parking there is limited...and that was on a Tuesday morning. Next trip I'm hitting the aquarium in Stanley Park and some of the museums. Review #35:I have stayed at the Renaissance in Downtown Vancouver for 40 nights in 2009 and 70 in 2010 (so far). I have come to rely on the consistant quality of this hotel, it's restaurant, lounge, and the nearby facilities. The lobby restaurant is wonderful - though pick the Tenderloin over the Ribeye. Every night there is a 9pm shot from the cannon at Stanley Park to the North. I would recommend walking to the Olympic Torch across the street to get the full effect of the echo. Review #36:We left booking a hotel in Vancouver to the last minute, and so kinda rushed our booking into this hotel. It turned out to be a great choice - nr downtown, an ocean view room, nr the float planes (essential for that trip to Victoria!) and with the most helpful staff! The construction work didn't bother us too much, although I do wonder what will happen to the great views! Review #37:Well the hotel was superb in every way. The staff caring, friendly and polite. Room was just so perfect, overlooking harbour and float planes. It was my 60th birthday, and they made it soooo special, we cannot thank them enough. Hotel spotless throughout. The best variety of breakfast , and such happy staff. We will deffinately stay here again. If you want a great stay and location, and want to feel special, then stay here. Wow Review #38:This hotel has a great view and is located in a continence location. The pool and gym are very nice. The room is not too spacious but it is still a good size. The bathroom is kind of small but at least it is clean. The parking is terrible and super expensive. The customer service is poor. Our bath tub didn\u2019t drain very well the first night we stayed. We told the front desk in person and asked them to fix it the next morning. However, the bathtub still did not drain well the second night when we showered. Apparently they did not take care of the problem at all. I called the front desk about this problem again, but they told me there was no engineer stand by in the evening. However, we can just let the water over flow. I really felt sorry for the house keeper. This hotel really needs to improve their management. We got a good deal from Priceline so I was guessing that\u2019s why we got a room with a bad tub. They definitely discriminate Priceline customers. Overall, the stay was not too bad for the price we paid. Review #39:I arrived after a long flight from London to a very friendly reception. I asked about upgrading to a waterview but decided it was too expensive. The reception clerk said I was booked for a king which was quite small, and would I like a queen double which was bigger. It really was a large room, two beds and a sofa. It also had two windows and a small balcony at the back from which you could see the water do I was delighted. The service was excellent in the restaurant and bar, and I used the free wi if in the lobby area. I only had breakfast once as a treat, but it is costly so I can recommend Moonpennies ( turn left out the hotel cross at lights and you will see it at next junction ) I didn't like the music in the lifts but that is a personal preference. the pool was very good too. It is very easy for the convention centre and the shops so I would say it's worth it. If you are a Marriott rewards person you currently get half price on entrees. I thought that the level of housekeeping on floor 6 was exceptional . Review #40:I'll have to agree with the last poster from Minneapolis that the hotel is a bit old, but the service and amenities are terrific. I am a regular Marriott Platinum Member (75 + stays per year) of this hotel and I really don't think outside variables such as construction can affect service. I guess people will always see things the way they want to see it. I could see things such as \"bad weather\", pollen count and full moons would bother this type of traveller too. I am there on a weekly basis and the staff are always cheerful and willing to help. Unfortunately, hotels are not a fantasy land where the rain, traffic etc will suddenly disappear but I can assure you that the smiles will always appear. Everyone has the option when they wake up to be positive or negative. I'm sure you know what my choice is. Review #41:We went through Priceline and got a great deal. When we showed up, there was a problem with our reservation, but with patience on our part, it was resolved. I think dealing with the staff nicely led us to being assigned a room that overlooked the Harbor. It was beautiful. It was on a lower floor, however, so once the planes started up---pretty early in the morning---we could hear them. But once you were ready to get up, watching them take off and land on the water was awesome. They sort of nickle and dime you here. We wanted wine glasses in the room, and they charged us $5 for them. And if we didn't have such a great room, I wouldn't have been as happy with this hotel. The hallways were fairly beat up, but the rooms were brand new--this was pre-Olympics, it looked like the whole place was due for a makeover. This place was a zoo on Sunday with a whole slew of people staying here on pre-cruise reservations through a cruise company. The lobby becomes a disaster, with everyone downstairs with their luggage. Just know getting your car will take a long time. Not as nice as the Marriott Pinnacle across the street. Review #42:This hotel gives you exactly what you would expect from a Marriot however is far too overpriced. You have to pay for internet which is disapointing too. The hotel service is great though and the food is too. The hotel is also a little further out of the way. Review #43:We stayed here for a couple of nights on a weekend trip from Vancouver Island. The whole experience was great from the upgraded harbor view room to the staff. This is the first hotel I have been in that caters to the techno geeks. They had loads of plugs built into the desk for all your techy toys. The room was was large and very clean with all the modern amenities. Would highly recommend. Review #44:Stayed at the Renaissance in downtown Vancouver while working a trade show at the Vancouver Convention Center. Overall the rooms were very nice and well appointed and the hotel staff was very friendly. Unfortunately during our stay there was a party for Persian New Year and the vibratiions and noise could be heard throughout the hotel during the night and very early the next morning. Being in the travel industry (I work for a CVB) I understand how much revenue those events provide but what I don't understand is why a more reasonable time limit was not placed on the music. When I brought it up to the hotel staff the next morning they said they had received a number of complaints from guests and were very sorry. Here is an idea to avoid complaints, turn off the music at 12:30. Had the party not been going on I would definitely have reccomended this to other business travelers. I think next time we are in the area however we will stay at another property. Review #45:I stayed here for a weekend getaway with my wife. The rooms are small (for a \"4 star\" hotel at least) but clean. Very quiet for an inner city hotel, double windows keep out the noise. The free gym and pool are nice perks. No real complaints about the facilities, just the price/rating. I booked through Priceline and snagged a room for $85. After winning I went to the hotel's website and checked what the regular rate is- about $280! So I thought I hit the jackpot by getting it for $85. When we arrived and I saw the room, it was much closer to a 3 or 3.5 star, $150-$180 a night hotel. So I was still happy with my rate, but this is not a 4 star hotel by any means and it kinda put a damper on the weekend. If you stay here DO NOT pay retail price or you will be disappointed. Review #46:Stayed a week and the location was perfect being right near the Congress centre, waterfront and shops. Average room with twin beds instead of a King. At least the beds were large and comfortable with good soundproofed windows. Sleep quality was good although the walls were not quite thick enough to drown out the coughing next door. The food in the restaurant was excellent and I was quite happy to eat there for various lunches and dinner as the menu changed during the day. Staff were always very helpful and efficient. Breakfast buffet had a large range of hot and cold foods and was well worth the cost. Internet service in room was both wired and wifi with good connections. Gym had a good variety of equipment and I did not have to wait for a machine at any time even when htere were a few people in the gym. 4 treadmills, 4 steppers, 4 bikes and various weight machines as well as free weights. Pool & spa looked good but did not try. No minibar in room but there is a shop in the foyer and a vending machine in the gym. Also, a 7-11 just around the corner as well as a Starbucks. Good choice in Vancouver with an easy walk to local shops. Review #47:Stayed at the Renaissance Harbourside for three nights. I had a 15th-floor room with one king bed. Room had lots of space, with a couch and plenty of storage. Great showerhead. Had buffet breakfast. Eggs benedict were delicious, along with waffles and french toast. Service was excellent, and housekeeping was very efficient. Only bad note goes to the fire alarm with went off two nights in a row, making the elevators work on and off. Review #48:The Renaissance Harborside was a big disappointment to our trip. It definitely does not live up to the other (full service) Marriott's I have stayed at in the past. I am using my reward points for this stay. One positive thing is that we got a Harborside view instead of a city side view (despite what the reservation says) - so its fair to say they upgraded me. Another good thing is that the gym&pool are 24 hours. So - on to the ranting... 1) To our disappointment, the club lounge was closed for construction. --a) We were issued vouchers for \"nightly h'ordeurves\" and \"breakfast buffet\" --a1) The Club Lounge usually offer free unlimited food and drinks (bottled water, soda) for all registered guests. The one \"appetizer\" voucher got us ONE order of a \"small item\" from the menu at the \"Coal Bar\". And we even had to pay for the VOSS. --a2) We love to relax and kick back in the club lounge - this \"Coal Bar\" was - well its a BAR - not really a relaxing and kicking back experience for us. 2) There was no room safe 3) The whole place has an odor. --a) The entrance from the garage smells like a nursing home. --b) The room, and even the hall ways have an overwhelming (fragrant) cleaning agent smell. (it doesn't necessarily smell BAD...its just always present and distinct) 4) There are 2 new high rises blocking the view of the harbor. (My room was on the 12th floor) 5) There was no complimentary bottle of water (usually ~20oz) in the room. one word sums it up - OLD I'm going to move across the street to the Marriott Pinnacle. At the very least their lounge is not closed. Review #49:Although this hotel has a great central location, there were several drawbacks including very small rooms (especially the bathrooms) and construction in the lobby. The rooms appeared to be recently renovated but we found it to be very tight for two people. The bathroom fixtures were fine but nothing special. We did have a nice view of the water however. As mentioned, there was construction in the lobby and it was an uncomfortable place to work on the internet (to avoid the steep browsing fees in the rooms). The business center had one terminal that was occupied and the concierge floor lounge was closed over the weekend so it was a small hassle to do some work. ATM machine was also broken so we had to walk down the street. The health club is very spacious and has a nice pool and hot tub but the room still has a cicra 1970s feel. We didn't take advantage of the restaurant but it at least appeared to have a nice ambiance. We were also recommended a \"romantic\" restaurant by the front desk..not a bad place but it was packed with large, loud groups of drunken 20 somethings where you had to shout to be heard three feet away (confirmed by online reviews we unfortunately read after the fact). Otherwise service was decent. Review #50:Hotel was very clean and upscale. Views of the harbor were fantastic, close proximity to pubs downtown and other eatery's. Being very close to the conference center was a plus. Restaurant could use some work on the service side but other than that everything was great. Highly recommend. Review #51:We booked our room on points at the very last minute after having travel issues with returning to Calgary from a long trip to Nepal. This place was exactly what we needed - great bed with great linens and 6 lovely pillows. It was quite and clean and we woke up to a beautiful view of the harbour in the morning. Globe and Mail was provided in the morning. Aveda products are provided as well. Nice tea and coffee are also provided. Shower was hot and amazing. Desk and coach provided. They also let us have a late check out - 2 pm. Wifi is crazy expensive at $16 per night... not sure why they charge when the Starbucks around the corner is free. The bathroom is a little small for this type of hotel. Review #52:I cant believe i got this for 50bucks a night on priceline. Its basically all you expect from a 3and a half star hotel. pool, sauna, training room was excellent along with security. It was a little far from the cheepie restuants and the subway. Great views and service. Review #53:I stay at the Renaissance usually once a year, and I've to say that as much as I enjoyed it 4 years ago, today it's not the case anymore. The hotel's location on the waterfront is really cool (nice view of Grouse mountain). Ask for a high floor and the waterfront for the view and the noise of the water-planes that take off/land in the early morning. There's a new row of building being built between the hotel and the waterfront, and it's been going on for years (i.e. noisy all day long). The hotel itself needs to be refreshed. It's becoming really oldish and the room rates don't match anymore with the quality of the hotel. Breakfast is good but the menu hasn't changed in years. Review #54:High End Hotel with excellent service, great food and incredible view of the bay. It is located near the floatplane \"airport\", which doesn't cause any trouble due noise. The location of the hotel between Stanley Parc and Gastown makes the exploration of Vancouver Downtown easy, by bike or by foot. Review #55:The staff was very accommodating. The room was exceptional - modern, clean, excellent view of harbor, comfortable bed, coffee/tea in room, 6 blocks from our cruise ship dock, we could walk to everything, excelletn location, we would stay here again. Review #56:We booked this hotel as a finale to our holiday & decided to go above our budget: I'm not convinced it was worth it. We had planned to stay 4 nights but because our hotel in Nelson was so awful we extended our stay by 2 nights to 6. The hotel wanted to charge us an extra $49 per night extra for ALL 6 nights for the privilege as was we booked these 2 nights by phone & not the internet! However, after some heated discussion we agreed to pay the extra for the additional 2 nights only which was still annoying. Don't be fooled by the tag \"harbourside view\": since the hotel was built the harbour has been extended & 2 years ago an appartment block was erected in front of the hotel partially blocking the view. Also, a second block is under construction limiting the view still further. We had specified a harbour view & the first rooms we were shown DID have a view but only if you can see round corners (needless to say we soon complained & were moved). The hotel is in a great location for exploring Vancouver & for taking the seaplane to Victoria. The rooms are spacious but have neither a fridge nor a mini bar. One recommendation is the restaurant on the ground floor-the food & service are great. Review #57:I found this hotel to be far above average, and I would be absolutely thrilled to stay here in the future. The room I had was on the 7th floor and faced the harbour. There was a lovely balcony with two chairs that was wonderful for relaxing in the morning with a cup of coffee (which is available in the room). The room was extremely spacious with a very comfortable bed, a chaise lounge, and a desk chair. One thing I loved was the media center on the desk with many outlets to charge all of your electronic devices. The tv was a newer model flat screen of a nice size for the room. I really loved the decor of the hotel. From the outside, it's relatively plain, but once inside you immediately see that the decor is very modern and chic. The hallways are red, and my room had walls of two shades of yellow. The bathroom had yellow walls with black countertops, very sleek. I also enjoyed the modern security feature of the elevator, which required a key card to select your floor when going up. I dined at the hotel restaurant one evening, and I found the food to be excellent and the service to be good. The same menu was available for room service, although I did not use room service during my stay. Each evening I returned to my room to find chocolates on the bed, which I thought was a nice touch. One of my friends returned to her room early one evening. Housekeeping knocked on her door and offered a warm towel along with her chocolates. I was never in my room early enough to benefit from this service, but I thought it was nice also. I was in the hotel for 3 nights, and on the afternoon prior to the last night, I recieved a call from the hotel asking if my stay had been satisfactory and if there was anything else they could have done for me. They truly care about customer satisfaction at this hotel. Review #58:Renaissance Vancouver Harborside is a great hotel for stay in this dynamic city, 2 blocks away from shopping, restaurants, museums and the harbor. This is our 2nd time staying at this hotel, both times, we got a harbor view room on upper floors on the corner, the view is simply gorgeous. The hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful with suggestions on sightseeing, restaurants and cultural events. It is a pity though that more and more of the views are obstructed by the high rising condos between the hotel and the harbor. Review #59:We stayed at this hotel after a Holland America Cruise. The room here was HUGE in comparison to the boat, but it was also on the 14th floor with incredible views of the Harbor, part of Stanley Park, and the Seaplane terminal. Room was clean and comfortable, best bed on the entire trip! Service was also top notch. This place may be in the geographic shadow of the impressive Pinnacle Hotel, but it was top notch in every respect. Friendliest Hotel staff ever for such a large hotel. One small reservation, the lobby is very noisy much of the day and night, and there is no quiet area to use the free Wi-Fi in the lobby and do some work. Review #60:I stayed here in December 2007. I had a room with 2 queen beds and a great view of the harbourfront. I could watch the sea planes take-off and land... This was definitely a highlight, and I found it very amusing! The beds and bedding were very comfortable and I truly enjoyed the burger I ordered from room service. The staff is competent and very knowledgeable about the town. The desk agent spoke to me in Portuguese, and was able to provide me with very good input on activities and things to see during my visit. The hotel is clean and comfortable, and I will definitely return some day. Review #61:The hotel is in a great location just a couple of minutes walk from the convention center, and its harbor view rooms look out across the harbour. Our interconnecting rooms were spacious, and the beds were really comfortable. We had a very pleasant dinner one night in the hotel restaurant, and enjoyed the breakfast buffet and coffee machine in the Club lounge. The staff were all friendly and helpful, and we got some great sightseeing advice from the concierge, Alex. Will definitely stay here again! Review #62:Stayed here for 3 nights whilst DH attended a meeting. The hotel is very central within easy reach of skytrain, Stanley Park, shops etc.. We had a good sized room with enclosed balcony and a great view of both the bridge and the harbour. Comfortable Marriott beds and bedding. The staff were courteous and efficient (brought luggage rack and chairs for the balcony within minutes) and check-in extremely quick. Some people seemed to have great difficulty with the elevator where you have to insert your room key before you press the floor number, but I think it is a good security feature. Internet access is around $15(+ tax) noon to noon, although it is possible that some room rates include the internet, and the parking is expensive (did not have a car but glanced at the rates) but it always is in big city hotels. The lobby is modern but IMO the rest of the hotel has exceedingly garish carpet and the rooms seem to have been designed by a committee which never met together. Bright striped carpedt competing with elegant navy pin striped bedskirt; Modern dark/light geometric headboard next to blonde wood table: yellow block wallpaper and matching sheers - very 70;s to me. We stayed here as a change from our usual hotel and found it very comfortable, however we will probably revert to our usual hotel next visit. Review #63:We booked a trip to Vancouver at the last minute and could not get into the hotels that had been recommended as the \"top\" hotels in Vancouver. The picture of the hotel on the hotel web site was not very attractive. We were also concerned about the construction noise mentioned in other postings. We were a little apprehensive about this hotel. We went with this hotel because they guaranteed a waterview room/king bed/nonsmoking and the price was reasonable. The hotel was fantastic!! By far the best view and location I can imagine. After days of walking around the city I think its overall location is the best. We looked out our large windows and saw the harbor, seaplanes taking off and landing, boats, and mountains beyond. Incredible views and a very comfortable bed. The room was extremely quiet. The construction, mentioned in other postings, is past the pile driving phase and so noise was not an issue at all. All hotel personnel were kind and helpful. I recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #64:This was our second stay at the Harbourside; I'd been previously for a conference, when they were undergoing renovations in the lobby. We were staying this time for three nights to visit friends. We came direct from the airport, after flying up from San Francisco, and enjoyed (finally) taking the Skytrain right downtown. It was a short walk from the Waterfront station to the hotel. We had a room on a high floor, with a city view. The room was at the end of a hallway, and had a very interesting shape, with a large window. This meant the room was very bright in the mornings (when it wasn't raining ;-). We had a comfortable king-sized bed. Bathroom was clean and tidy as well. The room itself was extremely comfortable. The $15/day internet fee was pretty rich, but we weren't in the room much, and passed. We also didn't bother with breakfast; there are loads of places near harbourfront in Vancouver. All the staff we dealt with were friendly and professionally, particularly the concierge, who gave us good advice on where to go jogging. The only mild downside we encountered was with the room window: it sounded like it wasn't properly sealed - quite a bit of road noise came through, even though that part of West Hastings isn't terribly busy, and we were on a high floor. It didn't bother us much, though. As I said earlier, this was our second visit, and we would definitely consider staying again. Review #65:This hotel is situated in an ideal location for wandering around the harbour, with all the associated sights and sounds. The room we had was very comfortable, and since it was angled toward the street, we had a great view down the street towards many of the skyscrapers in Vancouver. Our only - not really a complaint, just an observation - is that the doors to the rooms are not as tight as in other Marriotts, which allowed some hallway noise into the room. Review #66:The Hotel from the outside looked old and Shabby far from the pictures posted on the web site. Check in was not a good experience it was 3 times befor we could get a key card to work to get into the room and on and on. The Restaurant looked nice but did not live up to the expectation.food was not good ,service was slow.20 minutes after coming into the restaurant we actually caught our waiters attention and it was not even that busy. Breakfast buffet was sub standard food was not fresh. Dinner promised to be something nice. It was not it was really just average compared to alot of other places near by this P2B restaurant is poor . Rooms were smaller than we expected .Did not like the dirty bathrooms and garbage in the side drawer made me feel dirty. Parking was excessive Internet was expensive 17 dollars for the day and we wee only on an hour All n all thiss is a low 3 star at best .Go elsewhere for a better experience Review #67:Great hotel overall. Secure, very clean, safe and great value for money. I would rate it equivalent to any great hotel in Vanc for much lesser price(Check for promotions) and if you are a regular, they would upgrade you to a harborside. Good resturant, easy access to everywhere, highly recomended. Review #68:We stayed at this hotel for a conference. We had a harbourside room, and the view was breathtaking. The room is very clean, comfortable and modern. The fitness facilities are great too, very well equipped, and little touches like fresh fruit in the fitness center are the kind of attention to detail that make a hotel stand out. Review #69:I stayed here over a weekend in June. The staff were very friendly and the room was good (oddly shaped though). My friend would be upset if I didnt mention the parking though. It's hard to see how to exit signs in the parking. They dont have big signs but those small exit signs by stairways! Review #70:The accommodation is very good, but you're paying for it. Even with the group rate I paid $190 (CAN) plus room tax and VAT. However, I had a very nice harbor view. In room internet is $16 a day for 12pm-12pm access (not even consecutive 24hrs). There are two computers in the lobby with free internet for guest use. There are a few coffee shops and one restaurant nearby with free WiFi (if you have a laptop computer). Otherwise, the rooms are spacious and well furnished. The staff is very helpful and can provide good info for first time visitors. There is a very nice upscale market roughly one block west of the hotel called \"Urban Fare\". It's a good place to buy drinks and snacks for your room and also a pleasant venue for a casual lunch. There are several cafes and pubs within walking distance. Two blocks east on Hastings, you'll find the Elephant and Castle pub which shows Setanta Sports (for the European football fans). There is ample food, drink, and shopping within walking distance. Check out the travel guide provided in each room. At around $200 a night, free internet would be a welcome perk. Otherwise, this is a great place to stay in Vancouver. Review #71:The hotel is overall nice....however if you have a higher vehicle or are renting an SUV chances are it wont fit under the low undercover parking and the closest alternative parking is expensive...the rooms are deffinately not sound proof as you can hear the conversation of people in the hallways rooms next to you etc other than this it's a decent place to stay Review #72:Great location for venturing into downtown Vancouver. Close to the Canada Place and Convention Center Piers - about a 5-10 minute walk. Great views of the harbor, water airport and Stanley Park. The hotel was clean, the service was good and it was a great home base for us. We didn't really take advantage of much in the hotel because of everything offered in downtown Vancouver. One thing I could have done without was the guy who owned the little lobby shop. Every time I went in there he tried to upsell me on something - mostly I just wanted gum or water. Review #73:We stayed here for 3 nights at the start of a touring holiday in Canada. The sole reason for choosing this hotel is that my husband travels frequently on business and we paid for the room using loyalty points. But we were delighted with our choice. We arrived mid afternoon and the welcome was the most friendly and sincere one I've ever known in a large, corporate hotel. Because my husband is a Marriott Elite customer, we were upgraded to the Elite rooms and we had a harbour view. OK, so the stunning view is somewhat marred by the building site outside, and the large crane but you can't blame the hotel for that. We couldn't hear any noise from the building site. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bed had a really thick mattress protector which made it extremely snuggly and comfortable. We were entitled to use the members room which included complimentary continental breakfast. This was very good and the room was kept well stocked. Because they don't provide breakfast here at weekends, we ate in the restaurant downstairs. It's the usual big hotel buffet. Good quality food but as always with these, I feel you have a eat a BIG breakfast to get your money's worth. There is a swimming pool and gym which was adequately equipped although if the gym is busy, you might have to wait for a particular piece of equipment. Hotel is well located, an easy walk from Gastown and the beautiful Stanley Park. I'd have no hesitation in recommending this hotel if you want one in this price bracket. We couldn't fault them. Review #74:Stayed for a couple of nights, midweek. Check-in was smooth and didn't have any issues. They didn't have king size available for me, so I had to take 2 queens. Didn't sleep too well due to 2 issues: 1. I woke up covered in perspiration ( I suspect they use one of those plastic mattress covers, and there is a heavy duvee), 2. pillows aren't as large and firm as I prefer. Desk chair was very poor. Could not lock it upright, and it would not raise as high as I needed to work at the desk. I'm 6 feet tall, but I was still working up at an angle to the desk. Sink/facet combo in bathroom is modern, but facilitates splashing. Had to wipe the counter constantly. Parking level for hotel takes a bit of driving to get to, and out of, but is convenient to the elevator. There is a safe in the room, and there large flat screen is connected to a panel of connectors on the desk, so you can hook-up just about anything to the television, like your computer, DVD player, MP3 player, etc. Patio doors open, but there is no balcony, only a railing. Overall, felt a little dated. Seems like it could use a bit of sprucing-up. Review #75:I reviewed this hotel before, and found a few issues, but things have changed a bit....We stayed here with some friends during a long weekend and found the room upgrades to be very nice. Yes, it is the same hotel that now has a building blocking those wonderful harbour views, but it is still a great place to stay. We called while waiting at the border, and were given the internet price right away with no dickering. We were greeted at check in with the usual warmth we have always found at this hotel. The big suprise was the room remodels. They have done a nice job. I also think it is worth mentioning the restraunt downstairs. If you want a truly hassle free, great breakfast, thats the place. I usually stay clear of hotel eateries, but the staff and good food make it a real bargain....Kudos to you Marriott. You have dazzled me again... Review #76:We happened to be in Vancouver on Canada Day. The Renaissance was perfectly located to experience all the Canada Day events and when it came time for us to leave on our cruise - we walked to the cruise terminal. Staff was very accommodating to our last minute requests. Review #77:Beautiful hotel and in a great location. We had a room that overlooked the water. However there is a lot of constuction going on, so soon they will lose most of that fabulous view. We spent about 3-4 hours at the revolving rooftop restaurant one night. That was one of the highlights of the trip, and a definate MUST if you stay there. Review #78:The location is wonderful, the hotel is nice, clean and beautiful. I thought the service was excellent from the Concierge to the front desk. I work for Marriott and they didn't know it, but still went above and beyond. The fitness equipment could use some maintenance. I would definitely recommend eating breakfast and the Urban Market next door. Amazing omelets (plus potatoes and toast) for $10.00! We ate there everyday. You can also pick up sandwiches and snack items if you hit the hiking trails (Grouse Grind is a must if you want a workout). Review #79:First visit to Canada and stayed at this hotel before and after going on Rockie Mountain Tour, thought it was in a great location, easy to get to and find everything. Found the staff very polite and helpful. Rooms very spacious and the beds very cosy and comfortable. There is some building work going on behind the hotel, but with the preparations for the 2010 Olympics going on it is difficult to find anywhere that doesn't have building in progress, we were not affected by any noise at all and would definately stay there again, and recommend it to everyone. Review #80:We stayed here for one night at an excellent price secured via a bid on Priceline. It was good value at that price but definitely would not be good value at the rack rate. Our 12th-floor standard double room had been remodeled but the furniture seemed low quality with knicks and scratches already marring surfaces. The new carpeting (stripes in bold colors that proved a distraction in the room) was already rather grungy. The room was good-size, though, and had a comfortable bed. The small bathroom was adequate and had Aveda products. There was a limited view of the harbor, which was pleasant to look out on, from the corner window. Our room was quite a ways from the elevator, which meant that I saw far more of the hallway carpeting than I wanted to see. The pattern -- two geometric designs featuring primary colors -- had a dizzying effect on me. This decor (and that within the room) is not what one usually encounters in a 4-star hotel. The hotel advertises a $23 daily parking rate. With tax, that actually comes to a daily rate of $31 plus some change. We thought that a bit steep so parked our car in a nearby Easy lot, where the cost is only $6 from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. At 10 p.m., we moved the car to a parking meter across from the hotel. Meters only charge between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. We checked out just before 9 a.m. so had no further parking fees, though the hotel tried to bill us for using its parking facility even though we never did use it. We finally managed to get that charge removed from our bill. Vancouver has many fine 4-star hotels. If you plan to pay the regular rate, I suggest looking elsewhere for your stay. Review #81:That was the worst New Year Gala ever...! My girl friend's Jacket and her keys got stolen, we got push several times by crowd and security, the coat check was disaster, people took any jacket they liked...! and then we asked Hotel Rep to get us a Taxi since my girl friend didn't have any coat to wear in -7 dgree outside, which took more than 2hrs to arrive. During this 2hrs we had to seat in the hotel cold lobby where we witnessed several drunk people vomiting and swearing. They didnt even get us a cup of water...! I am pretty sure lots of these guest weren't in age range that was claimed 25M/21F...! \"Thank you Renaissance and Icon Nights for ruining our New Year night\" Review #82:This is our second stay at this hotel. We had an amazing thing happen to us here... Alex, the concierge was utterly friendly, with a prodigious memory (she remembered our group from 2 years back... imagine! people everyday at all times, and she placed us immediately). While visiting the acquarium, my 5 yr old lost her camera, and was very upset. The next day, we went to Victoria for the day (she booked an amazing tour by ferry and hydroplane) and we left a note asking her if she could call the acquarium to inquire about lost and found. Upon our return, we found out that not only had she asked, she sent a cab to pick up the lost camera, put it in an envelope and had it sent up to our room with her name on it (Little Ms. Duarte) and a smiley face... we were at a loss of words at her amazing courtesy and out of the way service. Needless to say our daughter was thrilled at having found her 1st camera (which Santa had just brought)... We will remember this trip with the wonderful way her camera was found, not as the trip where she lost her camera! Many thanks Alex, you made us very happy! ! Review #83:stayed for 2 nights and had one of the best beds after a 23 hour trip to relax and get some well earned sleep.The restaurant was excellent with a good quality menu and excellent service and staff, compared to a lot of big brand hotels this represented great value for money for those wanting a 4-5 star hotel.There is a chinese restaurant called the oriental which is located on the corner near a pub only 60 metres from the hotel absolutely brilliant food if you are a chinese food nut like me,...seriously as good as it gets and i have been to most all around the world Review #84:We stayed at the hotel because we were leaving the next day on a cruise. It was very convenient to the Canada Place cruise facility. Unfortunately, our ship left out of Ballantyne pier which is not walkable. The hotel is OK. It is completely non-smoking, which is a big plus. It was quiet. The building was secure, you needed a room key to get to your floor and then the doors were reinforced. The room was in good condition and we did not use any of the other facilities. On the negative side, the room was small, the bathroom smaller and the bed was not very good. Check in went smoothly. There was a issue with the price but it was resolved at the desk (they had not given me the AAA rate) but I had a printout from my travel agent showing the rate. The location is good. We went up to Robson Street. We recommend the Bread Garden right off it, the HON (House of Noodles) Dim Sum but could not recommend Moonpennies. All in all, I would give this a 3 1/2. For the amount of money we paid, I think that we could have done better. Review #85:this is a great, beautiful hotel with a great location. m husband and myself, with our teenage son, wanted a budget hotel with all the amentiees so when ama offered us the harbourside for 117.00 per night including all taxes we jumped for joy! this enabled us to have two rooms for all of us to enjoy and relax. ongoing pre-olympic renovations were a daily ocurance but did not disturb us at all. we were on a higher floor with unobstructed views coal harbor, walking distance to shopping and stanley park. we spent our mornings drinking coffee from room service watching the harbour planes landing and fed sea gulls from our balcony. the longest we waited for room service was 15 minutes, excellant by our standards. the staff sent up chocolate covered strawberries and a hand written note wishing u a happy 20th anniversary. the valets provided us with driving directions and ideas of things to see and do locally. i highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again. we travel to vancouver frquently for quick romantic week long getaways to escape the alberta snow. Review #86:Great place. All staff we interacted with were welcoming and friendly. Room was beautifully decorated, modern, and very clean. Our visit started off nicely when we arrived at 10am, expecting to be able to just drop off our luggage until we could check in later. Without us asking, they quickly put us into a room. We had a great view of the city and the harbor, which made for nice viewing at sunset and sunrise. The location is great, as it is close to much of the action in Vancouver. Stanley Park is just a few minutes' walk away. Dinner at the restaurant was good, though like most hotel restaurants, pricey for what it was. A nice touch was the wheelchair the hotel has to loan guests (no charge), as my wife had just broken her ankle a week before. While the wheelchair was hardly top-notch, it did greatly increase our mobility. I recommend this place. Review #87:I often stay here for business as I'm a Marriott Platinum guest and need to keep points up. This hotel is clean a d very well situated in the downtown core. If traveling on a romantic weekend - as another reviewer was - you could do better by staying at an independent niche hotel or go all out for the Four Seasons or try the newly renovated Hotel Georgia which has excellent art deco finishing. The Renaissance has good! Well equipped rooms with desks! Internet and flatscreen TVs. Breakfast buffet is very good with lots of choices. Review #88:I travel a fair bit and am experientially weathered with the offerings of various hotels around North America in particular. I stayed at the Renaissance Vancouver and was initially put off that they were undergoing renovations to their lobby. However my chagrin soon changed when I was attended to chivalrously and promptly upon my arrival setting a standard that was maintained througout the entirety of my stay there last week. I spent a great deal of time at the entrance admiring the awe-inspiring art pieces that they have on the walls. I have never seen anything like the illuminated art work displayed. My inquiries revealed that Ron Sombilon, a local Artist, is the exhibitor. I commend wholeheartedly the Renaissance Vancouver for recognizing and nurturing their local talent. I will definitely make this hotel my first choice on my next trip to Vancouver. Review #89:The Renaissance Vancouver is an excellent hotel. The service was superb from the time we checked in until the time we checked out. The staff were very helpful, took care of all of our needs promptly. The location is great in the heart of Vancouver only 2 blocks from the harbor. The views from our room were tremendous. Review #90:the hotel lobby and bar were very nice but the bedrooms on the city side could do with tripleglazing as the noise was unbleivable we might as well have been sleeping on the street! If your looking for peace and quite this is not the hotel to go to,espically when your put into a room next to generaters. linen on the beds should be changed more frequently because there was a stench of them,they could do with whitning powder! Review #91:Older hotel with makeover, No bathrobes, no wine glasses, paper coffee cups, lack of furniture in room, only double beds if wanted a king it would have been $30 more, front desk would \"not\" compromise, parking advertised at $23 a day but with taxes over $31. We did get a good price booking through the internet but does this mean you should receive less then average service. I will not make this mistake again there are plenty of good hotels in Vancouver that \"do\" want your business. Review #92:We really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The location is very central and has beautiful views of the harbour. Unfortunately there is some building work taking place in front of the hotel but still the view is fantastic. We found the hotel staff very helpful and accommodating. Rooms were spacious and modern. Review #93:This hotel is on the waterfront facing the seaplane terminal. Get a harbor view room and the view is good. Stanley park a short distance away and close to cruise terminal.The rooms are a good size. food is very good.Staff very helpful.The only down is if you haveyour own car it costs$19 every time you go in and out the car park. Review #94:Apon arrival we received a room with a cityview. There was an air conditioning on the other side of the street that was quite disturbing. We complained the next day asking for a more quiet room and got the most perfect room facing the habour. It is absolutely worth it to book a room with habour view. You can see the sea planes take off and land and have a beatiful view on the ocean and Stanley Park. The beds are just great, you sleep like on a cloud. There is construction work going on but this is not disturbing at all. I can totally recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Vancouver! Review #95:My husband and I picked this hotel as it was a little away from the noise and bustle of Robson/Granville Street and we were not disappointed. Fantastic views from our windows overlooking the harbour and Grouse Mountain. What a way to wake up every morning. The staff could not do enough for you, especially the reception staff who were extremely helpful. Very clean and had a great pool and jacuzzi which was great for those weary bones after walking around Vancouver all day. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel again. Only thing is that another hotel is being built nearer to the harbour and in front of this one, so I wonder what the views will be like once the new hotel is built. Easy to walk everywhere from this hotel. Also very good was the business centre they have for residents which means you can use internet for free. Great idea. Review #96:I and a friend stayed at this hotel for the first 11 days of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. It is not possible to discuss value and/or price, because these are always way different during the Olympics in any city. However, what I anticipated to be a 3-1/2 to 4 star hotel was surprisingly comfortable, with overall pleasant and excellent service, and all that during the most frenetic time any city is likely to see. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was cleaned and straightened at least twice a day, and if we happened to be in the room, housekeeping made it a point to return later. The room was satisfactory for its purpose. In what was supposed to be a twin bedded room, the beds were actually larger doubles, making sleeping that much easier. Although the bathroom was small, it was evident that it had recently been refurbished. The furnishings were new, but fairly plain. We heard no noise from next door, or the hallway, and often slept with the window open to cool off the room (it was overall quite warm in Vancouver, and Canadians seem to crank the heat up more than we do at home). The hotel restaurant was surprisingly good, with an excellent buffet breakfast and a couple of dinners that were, once again, surprisingly good with fine service. I read many posts on Trip Advisor with respect to this hotel, and not all were positive, so I was somewhat concerned about our stay. But all in all, it turned out to be quite pleasant and satisfactory during what must be the busiest time ever for any hotel. Review #97:I stayed here while attending a convention at the Vancouver Convention Centre. Overall, my stay was fine, but considering the cost of the room, I have had better value elsewhere in Vancouver. Pros: -Nice view of the harbor -Clean rooms and lobby -Comfortable bed -Nice workout facility -Aveda toiletries -2-3 block walk to the convention centre -In-room coffee maker Cons: -Cost of in-room wifi (internet access was free in the lobby and I was actually able to carry the signal back to my room (I was never charged a fee :)) -Small rooms Review #98:Spent 2 nights in a harbour view room. Room was fine (though had to call for a shower curtain), nice view (though obstructed by an apartment tower), and good, but not great location. The aspect that sank the hotel for me was the poor internet connection, both wired and wireless. Have seen the same issue at the Vancouver Airport Marriott: intermittent, very slow connection. It took me hours to synch my email. On that basis alone, I would not recommend this hotel to business travelers. Review #99:This was our first trip to Canada and we stayed in the Renaissance for two nights and again two weeks later for one night before we returned home. Our room was lovely and the bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in!. The only downside was that our first room looked out onto other buildings and it was quite noisy from airconditioning units, however, we upgraded to a harbourside view on our last night and this was quiet and the views were gorgeous. Unfortunately there is building going on directly opposite and the view will be affected. We would definately recommend the Renaissance, the staff were all extremely friendly and provided a first class service. The food in the restaurant was superb and the location was perfect.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

My top of line fav is Sandman Suits on Davie because of its great location and price value. The hotel is part of Canadian chain hotels which are 3 stars but I think this hotel is 3.5 or 4 stars. If you are in Vancouver for vacation you have to go to English Bay, Stanley Park, Robson street and entire west end neighborhood. This hotel has a perfect location to all these great places and more. You can walk to any wehre and any time ( downtown Vancouver is very safe and busy even after mid night ). The only thing that it may bother some crowd would be the fact that this hotel is located on a friendly Gay neighborhood! I am not gay so if it did not bother me at all why should u be battered?! oh one more great thing is Davie street is full of good restaurants. You can try any cousins for good price. From Sushi, Greek, Persian to Italian ........ Review #1:Our stay was a positive experience. We paid a little and got a lot. We had a stove, fridge, washer dryer, cable, microwave - all the essentials for an amazing price. Staff were good and very courteous. Elevators were slow, but had no problem getting to places on time. Previous reviews were over reacting and exaggerated to a minor problem. Very close to all the alternative life style clubs - what a rocking good time!!! ! Review #2:We chose this hotel for a four night stay in July as it had a separate living / kitchenette area. We were not disappointed. The hotel is very centrally located in the gay neighbourhood of Vancouver - perfect for bar hopping as you don't need a cab ! There is a good selection of restaurants, cafes and bars nearby. In addition, there is a 24 hour drug store / small supermarket opposite the hotel which means that you can avail of having some creature comforts such as fresh muilk in your fridge and cereal for a late night snack. Staff were incredibly friendly which made our stay more comfortable. Would definitely consider this when next in Vancouver Review #3:What an understated gem.We loved this spot and returned to it on our second trip to Vancouver. The value is just great, and even through I really tried to find a hotel offering the same value around the city - I couldn't. We had rooms on 18 floor and the views are just insane whether you are facing sunset or sunrise. It is great to have the little kitchenette, and the drugstore across, bakery and fruit shop up the street have enough to get you more than set up for a tasty breakfast. We did our own thing really, but any time we interacted with the staff we found them to be super friendly and helpful. For us the location was great. We enjoyed being able to walk anywhere around the city centre. Only the odd time we needed to get a taxi, but that was usually after over-indulging at dinner or at the end of nice long days sight-seeing. The rooms aren't giant, but the living area makes up for it. Anyway - who if you're on hols you'll be out and about loads. Review #4:We stayed here for a week in August. It has a good location, being central to all the attractions/sights of Downtown Vancouver. However, it is in an area where some 'alternative' shops and nightclubs are situated, so may not be the ideal location for the easily shocked/offended. The suite we were initially given was on the 6th floor and was very noisy as you could hear the air conditioning from the ground outside. The staff were able to move us to a higher floor where the noise wasn't quite so intrusive. I would say that was the only positive experience we had involving the staff of the hotel. On the whole, they were not particularly amiable or helpful. That said, the staff in Moxies (the bar/grill where breakfast was served) were very pleasant. The suite itself was average, although not particularly clean/well equipped. Review #5:I arrived a day after my friends, but checking in was a nightmare for them, since the reservation was under the wrong name - through the fault of the central reservation service - but my friends were made to feel it was their fault! After I arrived from a 10 hour flight, we asked for extra towels and when housekeeping came to deliver them, we asked him to make my sofabed, but he brushed us off by saying the pillows and linen were in the closet. When we specifically asked him to make it for us, he said he'd send someone. 25 minutes later and nothing. I called down to enquire and was put on hold for an unacceptable length of time, so we ended up making the bed ourselves. Our room overlooks Davie Street and it isn't soundproof. The noise of people, sirens, music and traffic is so loud that you need earplugs. And parking is an additional $20 per day! The location is ok, but I wouldn't stay here again, primarily because of the standard of service. Review #6:A suppossed refundable sum of USD306.12 was deducted from my Visa account since 1st November 2010. Despite several calls from Nigeria the money was not refunded. The manager has refused to answer my calls again. I sent email he did not reply. They are fraudulent. I stayed in room 1405 of sandman suites. Review #7:Kinda located this hotel by accident when traveling by the seat of my pants once. The room rate was not cheap, but what they provide is an apartment, with bedroom, full kitchen and fridge, washer and dryer, living room, TV, and a private balcony. The room we had overlooked English Bay and the view was spectacular at night. The hotel's lobby is modern and luxurious and the service was above average. The room was very clean, nice comfy bed, well furnished. The location, as can be said for all West End properties, is fantastic. There are loads of restaurants, shops, boutiques, grocery stores, and attractions within just a few minutes walk. I love the West End and try to explore different restaurants and things to do each time I go. If you can afford it, the Sandman Suites is a good choice. I don't know how the parking is as I took the train up from Seattle. Vancouver is a very walkable city and the public transport is great, so a car is not really needed. Review #8:I really enjoyed my stay here. OK, so the rooms are a little small, but they're very clean, and having a full kitchen and washer/dryer is a big plus. The hotel staff was wonderful - friendly, helpful, and informative. Didn't eat at Moxie's, but did enjoy a nice glass of wine there on a couple of occasions, and the service was just fine. What makes this place such a great spot is the neighborhood. Hip, funky, and very, very interesting! Right next door is an organic grocery, really good restaurants of every ethnicity abound, coffee shops on every corner, the sex toy store is just across the street, head shop is next door on the other side, boutiques of all types, you name it! It's also within walking distance to Stanley Park, English Bay, Robson St ., and Granville Island. So, if you're not put off by a \"gay neighborhood\" and aren't offended by window displays of sexual devices or drug paraphernelia, but do love good food, walking in a beautiful city, and enjoy a funky neighborhood atmosphere, then this is the place for you. Review #9:Hotel was central, clean and tidy, we was not told that you had to place your room card in a slot in the lift to go up to your floor, so spent nearly 10 minutes in one lift trying to get it to go up!!! good security but they should inform the guests!! The room was reasonable, kitchen even had a washing machine, balcony had a good view but sent me dizzy as I dont like heights, the view down was of the outdoor swimming pool, but straight ahead was English Bay, bedroom was just big enough for the one double bed and the bathroom was quite small but adequate. Breakfast was free at the bar next to hotel, Moxy's and wasnt too bad, service was a bit hit and miss. Review #10:We booked this hotel through Canadian Affair, they recommended this hotel in Vancouver. We did a bit of web research about the hotel and the reviews seemed OK. We arrived after a 9 hour flight and found the check in was easy. We got into our room and was pleasantly surprised that although it was small, there was a small kitchen, living room and separate bedroom. The bedroom was small and think that the whole room needed some new decoration. The bathroom was the bug bear of this hotel, you had to stand next to the toilet to close the door. Not much room either when you got out of the shower, this is the only issue that we had. We couldn't believe that the hotel was in the heart of the gay village and felt very safe. Moxies was also great for the complimentary breakfast. Can highly recommend the cocktails during the day/evening. The wait for the lift was rather boring at times, I do feel that there should have been more lifts to use. Review #11:Booked this hotel with reservations after reading reviews. I arrived early from Whistler, the front desk manager Justin, checked me right in. I had concerns over my car, as Vancouver does have a homeless problem and they like to break into cars. he said it was an issue, but to park my car on the lowest level of parking away from the gates. It was fine my whole stay, 3 levels down, the hotel is security locked also. He also gave me suggestions on what to do in the area, talked to him a few times, he was great. The only issue was my room, it wasn't clean yet, this wasn't an issue to me though, as they checked me in early. Went back down and the manager Eugene was at the front desk, he was very concerned and apologized and I explained it was not a big deal to me ( as I checked in early), he immediately upgraded me to the Penthouse floor to a suite and offered to move my bags. The room is great and have enjoyed it. Yes there are homeless, but all of Vancouver has this issue, just not this area, the elevators are slow, but whats 2 extra mins, yes there is street noise, IT'S A BIG CITY!. Everything is close, yaleville, shopping all close. This is a perfect hotel if your looking to be in the middle of the gay area of Vancouver. Also try the restaurant, had lunch and drinks, the manager was friendly and the bartender Brian talked to me for hours about my 2 month long road trip and adventures he has taken. Food was great. I would stay here again no problem......The high speed internet is free too Review #12:We went back to Vancouver on the 5th anniversary of our wedding. We wanted to stay in the center of the gay district so the Sandman was our choice because everything we wanted (bars, restaurants, and spas) was in walking distance. We loved the hotel! Yes, the rooms are small and the elevator slow but location, location, location made up for it! The rooms are comfortable, clean, and convenient and where else do you get a kitchen and washer/dryer for the money? We will definitely return there on our next trip! Review #13:My husband and I stayed here for one week from 28th July to 4th of August and found the hotel to be conveniently located for all the tourist attractions and clean and comfortable.The room was cleaned and the towels changed on a daily basis and when I called the front desk for missing toiletries they were delivered to the room within 10 minutes.Housekeeping staff were always pleasant if we met them in the corridors or lifts. The front desk were pleasant and helpful with the exception of one young woman whom I found to be incredibly rude on each occasion that I spoke to her,but that would not deter us from staying here again. There were only two lifts working during our whole stay and they were incredibly slow and always busy. Our stay coincided with the Gay Pride festival and although the street was busy and lively this in no way affected our sleep quality. The suite concept was great as we could eat in or out as we pleased and the washer/drier was excellent for doing laundry before leaving to join our cruise to Alaska. There are many restaurants and convenience stores on the street, although we found everything very expensive(the addition of tax to everything purchased made the prices even higher) We would definitely stay here again. Review #14:Hotel has free WiFi. The suites are well equipped with a fully functional kitchen, even though the bedroom it self is a bit small. Lots of light. Washer Dryer in the room is great. Gym is well equipped and has a Steamroom attached. The Sofa bed us very comfortable. The hotel uses the attached Moxie's rtestaurant as its own, but there is a well stocked supermarket nearby and a fantastic bakery next door. G&L guests will enjoy the area. Pumpjack is across the street and there are many other bars and restaurants within a 2 block radius. Excellent for an extended stay as well as a short stay. Business travelleres will appreciate the working space as well as good private in suite space if you have to have to have a meeting. Review #15:We booked a room based on the positive reviews, and we were not disappointed. It has a full, modern kitchen with all the pots, pans, dishes, etc., you could ever need. The bedroom and bathroom are a little snug, but the living-dining-kitchen area tends to make up for it. It was clean and nicely decorated. Lots of grocery stores nearby to stock the kitchen. We were looking forward to the washing machine since we'd been on the road for a few days. It is a \"european\" machine, which I guess means only the staff can make it work. It is both a washer and a dryer in one. It didn't dry the clothes, so we had to hang them around the room. Not quite what we had hoped for, but perhaps better than having to leave the room for a laundry room in the basement or paying for the service. We had dinner at the Moxie the first night. It was quite nice, the food was good and it looks out on the street. The area around the hotel kind of blew our minds--in a good way. Full of xrated stores, ethnic restaurants, and eccentric characters. The \"host\" at the Indian restaurant across the steet reminded us of one of the actors in the movie The Birdcage. He was wearing a turban and in drag. It was quite an unexpected cultural experience. We were not charged for parking, so maybe that policy has changed. Overall, a very good location and accomodation. Be sure to join their senior program if you are 55 or older, you'll save quite a bit. Review #16:We had 6 nights at the Sandman Suites on Davie this June. The location is excellent, walking distance to most Vancouver attractions, shops and restaurants very close by. The rooms are good with a kitchen, lounge area, bedroom and bathroom. All very well equipped, including a washer/dryer and ironing board. Only a couple of faults, like much of Canada do not expect a plug for the bath and the swimming pool is outside - cold even in June! Review #17:Our family stayed for 5 nights at the Sandman Suites on Davie in Feb 06. It was like a home away from home with all the facilities needed for a family with young children. 2 tvs, (one for the kids) full kitchen, and very handy a washer/dryer combination in the room in a concealed laundry. The position was great with a short walk to Stanley Park (for exercise) and Robson St (for shopping). Lots of supermarkets, fruits stores and liquor store within a 5 minute walk. The staff were great, with a 24 hr desk and room service there was always help at hand. The views over the city and mountains behind were spectacular. For the price it was one of the best value hotels we have stayed in. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again next time we visit Vancouver. Review #18:One of the best hotels we have stayed in, friendly staff and friendly customers, though not a hotel for homophobes given as being in the middle of the gay district of Vancouver it attracts a certain type of clientele (my girlfriend and I included). The washer/dryer was great, allowing us to travel with a lot less clothes than normal and more space for shopping and presents. In most aspects this was a home from home, and better to go back to than your normal hotel room. great for shops, restaurants and nightlife, with the beach at the bottom of the hill, we couldn't have asked for a better location. For food try moxies grill in the hotel, Hamburger marys just down the road, Kams place with its Yoda-esque owner, and don't miss the Mongolian BBQ across the road cheap and cheerful. bad points are the lack of a decent TV channel (please get the BBC), and the refrigeration units on top of the restaurants are a little noisy, but in a city thats to be expected. Definitley worth a visit. Review #19:My husband and I recently stayed at the Sandman on Davie for a few nights. It's a real mixed bag, so here are the pros and cons - Pros - great location, right near a 24 hour supermarket/pharmacy and plenty of terrific affordable restaurants. Lovely walk to Stanley Park and the beach. Having a washing machine and kitchen in the room/suit is brilliant too. The reception is also very stylish. Cons - Having seen the stylish reception, the very shabby, old fashioned rooms were a real disappointment (although the white goods were pretty new). The air con is one of those old boxes on the outside wall with a vent, which was practically useless, and the decor would have been old fashioned 15 years ago, with chipped furniture and very tired everything. But the WORST THING about this hotel was the fact that, without telling me, my credit card was charged $400 as a 'hold' when we checked in, and although I was told when we checked out that this would be refunded in 3 days, I ended up having to chase the hotel manager (who was VERY rude on email, saying that all North American hotels did this...well, having just stayed in 5 different hotel chains in America and Canada, the Sandman on Davie was the only one that a) didn't tell me, b) charged so much, and c) didn't automatically release the charge on checkout.) I also chased the hotel chain owner on Facebook, who did reply but didn't follow it up, and did not apologise for the rudeness of his hotel manager. I was finally refunded the money after more than 2 weeks, which is no fun when you're on holiday and need access to YOUR OWN MONEY. So, there are good points about this hotel (basically location and washing machine! ), but make sure that you can afford an extra $400 on top of your spending money before you check into this hotel as you may have a fight on your hands to get the hold dropped from your card. Review #20:We booked a room for 4 nights to see the sights of Vancouver and were glad we booked this hotel. The suite of rooms had everything we wanted including a fully functional kitchenette and washing machine. The size of the rooms were perfectly acceptable and we over looked the heated outside swimming pool (8ft max depth). Unexpectedly, we were given breakfast vouchers for each day which was a nice touch and all staff we had contact with were polite and friendly. A leaking iron we reported was replaced almost immediately. As our taxi was not due to 2pm on our last day, the hotel allowed us to check out later then normal and this was really appreciated. The area is not too far from all the shops or beach area. Review #21:Stayed here for 10 days in mid/late October, had one of the smaller suites but the size was more than adequate - and the price was exceptional value. Facilities were great, as were the staff. We arrived well before check-in time, having had a morning flight from the UK, no problems checking in early. Location is excellent - know the area well having stayed at the Sheraton on previous visits, but it will be the Sandman on further visits. Does everything it says on the tin and more besides. Review #22:I stayed here for 4 nights and had a great time. The staff on reception were always friendly and helpful (although I agree with one review that they could improve their knowledge of tourist activities in the Greater Vancouver area - but that's a minor point). My room in the hotel was great (although I didn't get a room with a view - only the 5th floor). I loved the fact that it had a washing machine in it and the separate lounge and bedroom was also quite pleasant - made it feel a bit more like a home away from home than a normal hotel room. The bed was almost a little too big for the bedroom! There was heaps of storage space (if you needed it). The kitchen was equipped with a dishwasher and a microwave. The free internet access is also great - there are only two terminals, but there was only one time when I wanted access and both terminals were occupied. The location is great. As with a previous reviewer, I didn't really get the gay vibe, but the hotel is surrounded by really good restaurants (esp if you like Greek food) and if you don't want to go too far, there is a restaurant/bar attached (Moxies) which serves great food (I think Moxies does the room service food as well, but i'm not sure). There are some 'panhandlers' around, but no one was intimidating or threatening and I felt safe at all times(and I was a female travelling alone). The hotel is only a short walk from the main shopping area, as well as Stanley Park. And if you want to take a bus, there is that option as well. I'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I went to Vancouver again. Review #23:Stayed there April 15-20, 2006. Originally booked a queen suite, but was upgraded to a king suite with ocean view (room 2210) as our original room was not ready when we checked in. Upgrade was amazing. 22nd floor and the view could not have been any better. We had sunsets and a view of English Bay. Staff is pretty good especially the valet, concierge guys and bar staff (in Moxie's). Jay (concierge?) was extrememly friendly and helpful. Housekeeping took terrific care of us and we have no complaints whatsoever about our stay. The Moxie's restaurant that is attached has fantastic food and the \"Tropicana\" drink (moxie size it) was my favorite. It's a fun and very busy neighborhood, but go with an open mind as Davie is an active gay community. If this is an issue for you - stay somewhere other than Davie. Everyone we met was friendly and helpful. It's also a 24 hour street so there is a 24 hour grocery and Shoppers Drug Mart within one block, which was very convenient. We ate breakfast in our suite and one dinner which we prepared. Otherwise there are so many terrific restaurants nearby that you want to take advantage of. I will always return to the area and the hotel whenever an opportunity arises. Review #24:While having an in suite kitchen was a nice touch. The fact that the heating for the suite did not work at all for the entire duration of my 6-day stay was inexcusable. Also, the water in the shower was barely warm at the best of times and cold for the last two. I had to wash my hair in the bathroom sink because oddly the water was hot in there. As far as the internet: no wireless and speeds comparable to dial-up and would randomly cut off. I will make a point of letting everyone I know how unhappy I was here and to recommend they stay elsewhere. No apology short of some sort of refund will make me happy. Thanks Sandman for ruining my trip. Review #25:Furniture is from early eighties, all scuffed up and similar to crap left at side of the road. OK if there is some room discount but we are talking 200$?+ rooms. Elevator takes along time but kinda appreciate the security which is excellent. Windows are sealed shut which was awful for lack of air flow and the fact we tried to cook food and the fire alarm constantly went off. I wanted to leave door open and just let it wail away but my wife wouldn't let me. No dish soap, no paper towels..(200$?). Wicked location. OMG You couldn't get better. Walk out the front door and there are so many directions that rock. View was great at the 21st floor, Oh, and when we arrived...they had booked us a room that was without a pull-out for daughter though we clearly booked one. Yes, and the TV's were both 28 inch old fashioned one with crap picture. Advetisement said pool open till 11 PM., nope...9 PM. Review #26:Just spent three nights at Sandman Suites on Davie. The rooms there are clean and well equipped with new appliances- fridge,stove,dishwasher and washer/dryer combo which looked a little complicated at first but was easy to figure out. The view was not great but the location was excellent for us, we walked all over downtown Vancouver and spent a day in Stanley Park. The staff were friendly and helpful. No complaints, would recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #27:I stayed at the Sandman Suites on Davie for one night and all I can say is that hotel reignited my idea of luxury! For the price I paid, it was well worth it. It's location is right in the heart of downtown with ample access to all amenities - cafes, restaurants, fast food etc. The service was outstanding!! Felt really welcomed and concierge was amazingly helpful to a new immigrant! I couldn't praise the service enough! The room I stayed in was absolutely beautiful! Balcony was spacious. Room was a little small but nothing uninhabitable. Overall, a wonderful stay and would absolutely stay again in a heartbeat! ! Review #28:We had booked another hotel, but when we arrived it was unsuitable. The manager recommended SANDMAN SUITES ON DAVIES and called for a reservation. We loved the hotel ! Our room had a small kitchenette, and a balcony overlooking English Bay. Everyone at the hotel were so very nice and helpfull. We will always stay at this hotel when we are in Vancouver. Review #29:This was my first trip to Vancouver and I picked the perfect hotel! I was on the 19th floor with a spectacular view of the downtown. The room had everything, full kitchen, washer/dryer, wifi, tv and sound system, even a dishwasher! There is a super right up the street for supplies, so I could cook, picnic on the beach which is a couple of blocks away, or just pack snacks and hike to the downtown. This hotel is in a great location and you will not be disappointed. Review #30:We stayed here for 5 nights visiting for a christening. We wanted to stay in a hotel with kitchen facilities so we could be more relaxed with our friends and prepare our own breakfasts. The facilities were very good and included a washer/dryer machine and fully fitted kitchenette. The bedroom was a bit small but this was compensated by having lounge area with the kitchen. The reception staff were generally helpful except for one female member of staff who was very unhelpful regarding parking and using the hotel safe. The hotel is situated in the gay area of Vancouver with lots of bars, cafes and nightlife. Downtown and Stanley Park are all walkable. The hotel has its own bar and restaurant but we found these expensive and a bit run down. There are lots of other better and cheaper options nearby. We were on the 15th floor and next to the lift which was quite noisy during the night. Also the lifts generally took ages to arrive so this might have contributed to the noise. Our friends room overlooked a pub which stayed open late and again was noisy. In fairness they were offered another room but it was next to the lift so they stayed where they were. We needed car parking for our last night at the hotel and thought this was expensive at \u00a316.50. The hotel was okay for what we wanted but we were left feeling there might have been other better options available for the \u00a3550 we paid Review #31:We had a good experience at the Sandman Suites, but only because they gave us a free upgrade. We had a terrible time getting to the hotel from the airport, with the commercial airport shuttle forgetting to drop us at the hotel and refusing to go back. We got the hotel finally, and they sent us up to our room, but the room was trashed. We didn't even walk in, just from opening the door, you could see that it was in disarray. We went back down to regitration, and they upgraded us to the penthouse suite. That was a very nice room - well decorated with good views and very clean. We later stayed in a regular room, and it was a little dingy and had a hole in the wall. My advice is that if you spring for the room upgrade, its worthwhile, otherwise, its what you'd expect from a budget hotel. Review #32:I traveled from Orlando, FL to meet friends from Calgary. We had booked a 1 BR suite for 5 nights, covering the Gay Pride events as well as the fireworks competition. We requested a King Suite facing the bay above the 20th floor. When I got there around 1pm and tried to secure our room, I was informed that we had a queen room facing the city. Luckily my friend had forwarded me his reservation and I showed the associate this on my phone. He seemed upset as the middle-man booking company \"messed up another reservation\". Either way, I told him I could not accept another type of room since there were 3 of us sharing the room. Long and short, he straightened it out (and it was very busy and hectic). It worked out fine in the end after 30 minutes of \"drama.\" As for the hotel, it's pretty basic, but comfortable. The views are awesome. The location is awesome. Perfect place to spend pride, or enjoy the whole Davie experience. The fireworks were amazing from our balcony. Of course the elevators (3 of them) are a JOKE! It's painful how slow these things are. I'm not kidding - and neither are the other reviewers - you are in for a \"treat\" trying to move vertically in this building! Soooooooo slow! But that's about all I can complain about. We had a great stay and this is a great option if you want to stay in this part of town! Review #33:Stayed three nights and overall found it a good place to stay in terms of location and suite facilities and was going to give 4 stars as staff helpful as well but... First room I was given was on 6th floor, on side with no water views and was noisy outside (traffic and some sort of extraction system from next building) and in (ice machine was just outside) and was non-smoking (I had booked smoking), though was told I could smoke on balcony. Complained about noisy ice machine and eventually moved to smoking room on 14th floor, with lovely ocean view and better arrangement of living room/kitchen facilities but right behind the lifts and they were a bit noisy in the night (though better than ice machine). Even on that floor the traffic noise was intrusive when balcony door was open. An odd thing was that the bedroom didn't have any curtains (only nets) - not a privacy issue on a high floor and luckily it didn't get light too early but the promised curtains never did materialise during my stay. I wasn't keen on Moxie's breakfast but as others have mentioned there are plenty of restaurants, supermarkets, fruit shops, bakers, etc very close by. Review #34:We have just spent three weeks at the above hotel. This is the second time that we have stayed there. I wrote a review last year praising them them for the quality of the apartment and also the service that we received whilst there. Twelve months later this has not changed and we can thoroughly recommend it The reception is first class and they are extremely willing to answer all your questions and queries.It is a good base to start your sightseeing of Vancouver and is centrally placed to easily get to all the visitor attractions. There are a large number of shops of all kinds on Davie Street and it is ideal for public transport. Well done Sandman. Review #35:This is a fantastic hotel with all the amenities you could possibly wish for. We had a living room, bedroom, and a full kitchen. Even a washer and dryer! We requested a room with an ocean view, and we were truly rewarded with one on the 20th floor. The location was superb too! Tons of eateries all around, and 3 blocks away from the beach. About the same distance from Robson street and the amazing shopping. Can't say enough good things about this place. Clean, spacious, neat and tidy, good service. And considering the location, it is really well priced. Review #36:Enjoyed the stay here. Near restaurants, bake shop, fruit and produce store. Easy walk to Engish Bay and Stanley Park. Accommodation were not overly huge by any means, but were comfortable. Found the kitchenette well equipped and quite handy to have. I would use this Hotel again unless there was a large increase in rates. Review #37:Sandman Suites Davie is a very nice stay for us. My wife and I bring our 1 year old with us, having a sofa bed and a seperate bedroom works great. Also, a full working kitchen is a vey handy feature. The staff were very good, very helpful. Valet parking is same price as self park, so take advantage of that if you have a car. The room is clean, modern. For the price, it is a very good stay for us. I really like the area we are staying. Yeah, there were some X-rated store in the area, but hey, just keep an open mind and you will be fine. It is a short stroll to the water front, good for a relaxing walk. There were lots of restaurant choices. Robson Street is a few blocks away. Review #38:We stayed there for three nights the rates were very reasonable. We got upgraded to a bay view which was spectacular. Took some beautiful pictues of the sunset right from our balcony. Never got tired of looking out or sitting on the balconly. The room was spacious with a kitchen and washer/dryer. The location was central to the beach and lots of great places to eat including bakeries nearby. Easy to walk everywhere from the hotel. The parking was secure. The front desk was very helpful. Can't wait to return. Review #39:Small bland rooms that should be avoided in heat wave. The room air conditioners are loud and do not keep the rooms cool in 90 F weather. If you are near the ice machine you will hear it all night long. Bathrooms are tiny and have few towels. In suite laundry machine is hard to figure out. All-in-one machine converts from washer to dryer. Ask the bell hop how to work it as the instruction in the room are not clear. My reservations were mixed up and I ended up on the fourth floor (Note: lower rates below the 10th floor). Room below the tenth have no view. Parking is extra. Overall a very average hotel. Nothing special. Location is good, close to English Bay and in a gay area of Vancouver. Nice bakery and ice cream place nearby. Review #40:I stayed at Sandman suites on Davie for 11 nights in may 2011. The first 48 hours didn't go well: the toilet broke twice & the first full night of sleep to be had after a long flight was interrupted by the fire alarm & all guests evacuated to the street in the early hours. There was no information available & seemingly no staff other than a night porter on duty, although a guy dressed in flip flops & shorts, named Alex, purported to be the manager on duty. It's quite scary to meet fireman wielding axes on the stairwell & difficult to regain sleep when there is no information or reassurance forthcoming. Apparently though this was the 2nd incident in 4 days due to 'a problem with the system'. A written apology to guests was issued next day but no concession for the inconvenience. On picking up my bill I find I'm being charged a higher rate than that quoted at time of booking & as my request for written confirmation was ignored 3 times I don't have any evidence of this. If you decide to stay here request a room with hard wood floors as the carpeted rooms smell bad due to inadequate cleaning. King size suites are small, cramped but well equipped. Sea view overlook the parking lot & side street where very noisy garbage collection takes place at 8am daily. Review #41:This hotel is in a great location and diverse neighborhood that we really enjoyed. The hotel itself is ok. The rooms were clean, although they did not get around to making up our room until 6 pm one day. The first night there were loud people on our floor at 3am. The manager came up a number of times before it ended. They do have washer/dryer in room that we used, but expect it to take about a day a load! There are plenty of places to each and drink, we ate at Stepho's right near by and was worth the wait in line! Again we really enjoyed Davie Village. From this hotel you can walk just about everywhere in Vancouver. Just be careful walking from gastown to chinatown. Lots of sketchy druggy people. Review #42:After mixed reviews my girlfriend and I opted for this property due to a great price for 7 nights. Any apprehension was lost from the start. We were greeted with a smile and at just on 13:00 our room was ready! One of 3 elevators did not work for the week we were there but the other 2 were ok. There are over 20 floors to service so it takes time! Our stay on the 15th floor was great. The view was incredible and inside the suite was not bad either! Full modern stylish kitchen facilities including dish washer and washer/dryer were at our disposal. Large TV and Wi-fi, it had it all. The bedroom sported another large TV and air-con unit. Throughout the suite, plenty of hanging space and complimentary bath robes. Davie st. has a great community spirit with many bars, restaurants and clubs nearby. Also 2 supermarkets meant everything was to hand. Public transport on doorstep and easy walking in any direction contributed to a great stay. An excellent though pricey Moxie's grill bar/restaurant on site also provided room service. A complimentary safety deposit box was also a nice touch. Staff were very helpful and answered all my questions. Davie st. might not be for everybody since it has a large gay community with after dark noise, might pose a problem fo families. Overall, it was tops! this property really enhanced our stay in this magnificent city. Review #43:Poor front desk service along with no suite cleaning service (no fresh towels, bed linen's, etc). Passenger elevators were always used by staff with bags of garbage, dirty linen, even a greasy work trolley and ladders! We were even told to notify the front desk of our coming and goings because how else does the cleaning staff know to do up the room! When we complained about the suite not being cleaned, we got nothing but bad attitude service from the front desk staff (we felt we were like being treated badly when asked about the service). When cleaning staff did come, she could not even speak English so we had to leave our suite for a couple hours so it could be cleaned. We had inquired about why a \"stay\" room is not cleaned (or at least fresh towels) and the front desk manager at the time said \"stay rooms are not cleaned because our cleaning staff only work from 9-5) and rooms that are checked out get priority! Doesn't make sense to me, isn't it the other way around? Even upon checking out I asked for the GM business card and the front desk girl literally threw the card at me! So, if you need a downtown hotel in Vancouver...don't stay at the Sandman Inn! Review #44:My husband and I just spent four nights at the Sandman on Davie and loved it. We have been to Vancouver many times and have stayed at a lot of different hotels but now we've found 'the one'. The location couldn't be better. As previously stated it's very close to everything you could want. The suites are very well appointed, and the kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to prepare a meal if you choose to. Having the option of a washer and dryer was an added bonus. We chose the ocean view suite when we booked and were very happy that we did, the view was amazing and well worth the extra cost. Review #45:We stayed at The Sandman for eight nights at the beginning of May. The hotel is in a great location with all major downtown attractions within reasonable walking distance. There's a nice bakery and market a couple of doors away and plenty other stores close by. (I suppose some people might be put off by the adult store across the road). The staff were all excellent , knowledgeable on the city and always helpful. I would recommend that you get a room on a higher floor. We were on the seventh floor and did get a little bother from traffic noise and the sound of dumpsters in the alley being emptied early in the morning. We also didn't have too much of a view. My only (admittedly small) quibble was with the blinds in the bedroom which didn't quite fill the window , leaving a gap that allowed the early morning sun to shine right across our faces. Still , it stopped us sleeping in ! Loved Vancouver and when we inevitably return would definitely stay at The Sandman again. Review #46:Wife and I stayed 3 nights in Oceanview Queen Suite (22nd floor) which was immaculate (kitchen was spotless) and new with plenty of room. Outside balcony offered nice harbor view with city view (from our side of the hotel) beautifull when lit up at night. Good location on Davie street close to many different stores/markets/bakeries/restaurants/bars. At the front desk Mimi offered good touring advice and quickly made arrangements for us when requested. The restaurants and bars we spent time at the end of our day on Davie St close to the hotel offered friendly people and wonderful service. Vancouver is such a dynamic city - hated to leave! Charles & Sue Review #47:Located in a rough and downmarket area with lots of down and outs hanging around. When emailing my booking I asked for a quiet room because we are both light sleepers. I had an email back saying that if we paid to upgraded to a high floor this would be quieter for us and we would get a room with a view of the bay. This we did and again stressed that we did not want to be near a lift, drinks machines etc. On checking in I specifically asked the receptionist 'this is not near a lift is it' to which she replied ' no, its not near a lift'. Could not believe it when we found our room, not only was immediately situated next to the lift , but the backs of both lifts were on the other side of living room wall. Because we had walked round the area for 3 hours waiting for the room and were so tired we decided to give it a go but at 12.30 at night could not stand the noise of the lifts any longer, and asked to be moved. The only other room they could offer us was on a low ffloor on a corner, with 2 busy roads below us. We are really angry that they blatently misled us at reception and did not take in to account one bit our requests. Broken hairdryer in the room and had to make 4 requests for a replacement, which took an hour to arrive. Expensive parking. Review #48:Before we went, I read several reviews indicating that the hotel rooms looked a little \"tired.\" This was NOT the case for my room or the two others I booked for family members. The rooms were fantastic...loved the separate sitting room. The views from our floors (14 and 15) were exceptional whether we were on the city side or the water side, though I must say that the sunset over the water our first night was simply unbeatable. The staff, from the maid to the front desk, was excellent. Indeed, they remembered your name when you came downstairs and that simply doesn't happen that often these days. We had both one dinner and one breakfast in the hotel restaurant.....money and time well spent. Best of all was the location. This is a very vibrant part of town...always something going on and within walking distance of the entire downtown area. I would readily recommend this hotel to anyone. The fact that this is the first review I've ever written is evidence of my enthusiasm. Review #49:The best thing about this hotel is it's location. Right in the middle of restaurants and green grocers, there are always tons of hipsters around. It's also just a few blocks from the ocean and I walked to Stanley park everyday. Fun! The hotel itself was strange, but good. The lobby is ultra-modern and has the ambiance of a club. This led me to the belief that the rooms would be similarly sexy. The rooms turned out to be very neutral and reminded me of the 80's, but were very clean and large. I like the washer/dryer. Tres handy. My room had a nice patio that overlooked the pool with a truly great view of the mountains. I like watching tv before bed and was very happy that there are not one, but two, count em, two tvs!!! One in the living room and one in the bedroom. Our room was always clean and the staff were very helpful. Conclusion: I liked it. Review #50:We booke d here for the first night of our 3 week trip to the area, and the price seemed very reasonable for what we were getting, and it was! The suite gave us a great view over Stanley Park, the city and the water and the room was clean, compact and bijou. Probably the only thing we didn't like was the fact that the balcony was very unsafe for children and the door out to the balcony could easily be opened by our 2 year old. So safety was a bit of an issue here but otherwise the room was great. The reception was very funky and modern, and the staff helpful. Moxies was nice, except for the fire alarm! Review #51:This was our fourth or fifth stay at the Sandman Suites on Davie and we had a very enjoyable time again. The rooms are relatively small, especially the bathroom, but the compensation of excellent views and really helpful staff make up for that, and more. The rooms have well-equipped kitchens, and also a machine machine / dryer which makes our longer stays comfortable and give us more choice. It would be nice to have a better heater for the room since the fan in the unit is noisy. And a dustpan and brush would be a handy addition to the kitchen equipment. Other than that all seemed good to us. The staff are always very pleasant and do all they can to make your visit a pleasure. The local area suffered an expected and unusal power-outage for 6 hours and they did all they could to keep things going, and sent an apology to each room. It wasn't their fault, but they understood the inconvenience for the time that the power was out. The cleaning and maintenance staff are also to be commended for their friendliness and efficiency. The area is interesting and lively - all of life passes along Davie Street! It is very convenient (nice walking distance) for Downtown, English Bay and Granville Island, and has good bus links. Review #52:I enjoy getting to this hotel. This past year I was fortunate enough to visit in March and August. When I called for reservations in August the hotel was nearly full. The young man at front desk took my reservation and then upgraded my room to a luxurious PH Suite.What a nice surprise. As usual the hotel staff exceeded my expectations to make my stay comfortable and pleasant. I love the location of this hotel. With in minutes I can be walking through Stanley Park or the Sea Wall...or convenient to a quick get away to Granville Island. I don't have to travel far to be at some of my most favourite restaurants. I would totally recommend this hotel if you are in Vancouver and want to be thrilled with excellent service and friendliness. Thanks again to the Duty Manager that upgraded my reservation....he went way beyond my expectations to make this one of my best memories of travel this year. Review #53:The hotel was great value for money. We had a great room that had a fantastic view of English Bay. The room was well equipped and clean. We didn't experience any problems with the lifts although I guess we were there out of season so it was not that busy. The location is good with plenty of bars, restaurants and grocery stores on the doorstep. It felt a really safe neighbourhood. Its not far to Stanley Park which is well worth a visit. Would defintatley stay there again. Review #54:We stayed here for 3 nights while we were in vancouver for Doctor's appointments. To help save money we wanted a hotel suite with a kitchen. The room was big. It had a separate bedroom, living room, bath, and full kitchen. The only thing which was disappointing was the pool was an outside pool and closed for the season. You have to park around the back of the hotel which was a little awkward to begin with. There are allot of eating options such as Denny's, Indian, Asian, pizza, and pasta areas. Starbucks and Blenz are near by and a supermarket. We would stay here again. Review #55:Back from my 4th visit since January 2005. Stayed a week and you can't beat the Sandman Suites on Davie for convenience of in-suite laundry, full kitchen including dishwasher, and staff that are attentive and professional. The front desk can get busy at times, so allow some extra time if you know you might be in a rush. The elevators can be slow. Room service from the adjoining Moxie's Grill has good food, fast delivery and friendly service. The room service menu prices are on par with Copeland's, Bennigan's, TGI Friday's, Cactus Club, or Earl's. And when finished you can run the dishes through the dishwasher...how convenient! Great 'four-peat' stay and I recommend it for location, convenience, amenities, and price. The completion of the 3rd floor renovations include the top-notch Phresh Spa which may soon elevate this property into a higher room rate bracket in Vancouver. Visit while this is still the best deal in the WestEnd and Downtown. Review #56:Just had a three night stay at Sandman suites.... although it was a bit noisy (I was there over St. Patty's weekend), the hotel was great. Room was very spacious and front desk staff were very helpful. I was given a complimentary upgrade with a wonderful view of the sea and mountains... Location was great. Easily walkable to many nearby attractions including Stanley Park, Canada Place, etc... Good selection of restaurants nearby including a great thai place across the street.. I was very happy with my stay and hope to return soon! Review #57:We stayed at the hotel the first week in September and absolutely loved this hote. Yes, it was a small suite but for our needs it was absolutely perfect. The hotel is in a great location to walk to restaurants for dinner and with the kitchenette you were able to bring home left overs if necessary. It is also located down the street from a small market and a market for fruits and vegetables. This was nice for my husband and I as we were able to get supplies for breakfast and save on money of eating out. The room was clean and housekeeping cleaned it up every morning while we were out. We also were upgraded from a queen sized city view room to a king sized ocean view room and the view from our room was just amazing. There is a cost for parking every night. However, it does include valet service for your car which was very nice. My only complaint regarding this is that I wish they would have published this rate on their site prior to our arrival so we could have planned better. Overall, our stay was fabulous and definitely would stay at this location again when we are in Vancouver. Review #58:First time in Canada- and I went alone. I was a bit apprehensive about the whole thing- but it was a great area. Sandman suites on Davie was alright; the elevators have a mind of their own. W/in 2 blocks there are 2 Starbucks, a Greek deli (yummy pitas) Stepho's Greek restaurant (good calamari), Moxie's next door, a grocery store, a pharmacy, Kinko's, 2 french bakeries, 2 Indian- 2 sushi restaurants and a great produce store a few steps from the entrance of the hotel; you really don't have to go far for a lot of variety in food. The bus runs on Davie street which is convenient; and Robson street isn't far where there are a lot of apparel stores (& there's a Mall about a mile away). I took an amazing sight-seeing tour that picked me up from my hotel, and I felt plenty safe walking around looking for bookstores and restaurants at night by myself. Sandman definitely isn't the Marriott or Embassy Suites, but it suited me just fine for a trip alone. The hotel staff are OK, some are pretty nice & others act like they are there cause they have to pay their bills (they move pretty slow- but I wasn't in a hurry so I didn't let them stress me- until I needed toilet tissue and it took them 50 minutes to bring it to my room). The bedroom in the standard room is pretty small. I wouldn't have wanted to sleep there w/ another person; would have felt a bit claustrophobic. Was there for the sight seeing and that made it a great trip. Review #59:The hotel is overall a 3.5 star I would say. We stayed at the suite with the kichenette, got a last minute deal and paid about $100/night. No real complaints. Its clean, spacious, bedroom is more private, and GREAT location. There's a mart down the street where we got some snacks and drinks for the kitchenette. It was very safe to walk around the neighborhood, plenty of people out walking so you don't feel uncomfortable. I know some people prefer to be in downtown proper but I enjoyed the fact that we were away from everything just a bit. We did get a rental car (Vancouver is very easy to drive around if you are used to driving in California) so we had no issues getting anywhere if we needed to. But we ended up walking around every night the 3 days we were there. Even though not in downtown proper we had plenty of exploring to do and had no issues finding restaurants and stores to browse. Its only 10 min drive to everything. It was the better/somewhat more modern/cleaner version of a business suite in a great location. Review #60:We found this apartment-hotel last minute and are so glad we did. It's a few minutes drive to Stanley Park and Granville Island. Really you can walk there but uphill can be a challenge. RELAXATION: There`s a spa right in the facility. Looked wonderful. FURNISHING: Our room came equipped with plates, utensils, etc. We had to buy a couple of things but there's a dollar store a few blocks away. ACCESS TO SUPPLIES\u00e9FOOD: Across the street is a Shoppers Drug Mart that sells groceries (excluding fresh fruit) but there's a market just downstairs and a fresh Cobs Bakery. We had amazingly fresh bread and fruits and vegetables every day. You can buy laundary and dish detergent at the shoppers but also available at the dollar store. THINGS TO DO: If you have young kids, just down the hill there`s a beach but further on there`s two playground (Stanley Park area) where the kids can play and walk along the beach making sand castles and collecting sea shells. During the day you can walk far out to the water and see all the fun water life (oysters, clams, etc.). There are tons of places you can eat. We had a rental handy so it was easy for us to drive out buy really, you can walk to a lot of the places. CONS: Not really much to complain about. The elevators are uber slow on teh weekends. I had to wait about 10 minutes on the Saturday morning we were there. I`d walk down but we were on the 16th floor. Night life can be noisy (though we really didn`t mind). Housekeeping sometimes missed our room (again, didn`t mind so much). FREE: internet, newspaper PARKING: Gated parking so pretty safe. $18/day POOL: Outdoors Review #61:Not a luxury hotel by any means but very practical. Located on Davie Street a very hip location with lots of restaurants and bars. Easy walk to all downtown tourist spots and the Washer&dryer made it a great stop between our Cruise ship schedules. Staff was very helpful and we would stay there anytime we need to be in Vancouver Review #62:We stayed here for two weeks - a combination of holidays and other commitments. It has a great location amidst really good restaurants, bars and shops. There's plenty of good fresh produce sold locally if you want to make the most of the suite kitchen too. Sure, there are a couple of 'adult' shops' across the street but they are pretty unobtrusive. We found it was very safe to walk around the area late at night (more than we can say for Granville Street!) The hotel itself was clean (I guess the hygiene issues have now been sorted) and comfortable with all the facilities we expected. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. The restaurant seemed a bit pricey but the hotel itself is very good value. Review #63:My wife and I stayed at the Sandman for 5 nights and 3 nights before and after our tour of the Rockies. On both occasions we stayed on the 20th floor, both rooms being spacious and well equipped. The rooms were always spotless, with plenty of clean towels. My thanks to all the staff at the reception desk who could not have been more helpful. The added addition of access to the internet to send and receive emails was another bonus. Davies Street as others have said is \"colourful\" but adds to the enjoyment of the stay. The hotel is a short walk to English Bay, Granville Island (with ferry), Stanley Park and all the shopping in Downtown Vancouver. My only complaint which should be resolved in a few months, is that when we stayed the swimming pool was out of action, it would have been nice to cool off after a day wandering around Vancouver Review #64:Don't confuse this with the other Sandman, and do look on the map to make sure you know where it is relative to where you are going. If you're planning to walk everywhere, know that the hotel is at the top of a hill that is steep in some directions. Our experience matched the average review here. Notes: (1) the air conditioner was a bit noisy but effective; consider that only if you are fussy about such things. (2) We enjoyed the Moxie's restaurant downstairs and felt the prices were fair (3) July 2010 and one of the three elevators was once again out of service; the remaining two were S-l-o-w. (4) The Shopper's Drug Mart across the street is open 24/7 (5) Don't be put off by the comments about the Gay District; unless you are homophobic it just won't be a factor. (6) Parking below the hotel is secure enough that I didn't worry. Review #65:Including taxes, I paid about 142$CAD for this room (approx $111USD). For its location in Vancouver, I think it's a great deal. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The rooms themselves are a little dated in my opinion, but there is a nice television and full kitchen amenities. The sofa bed is small - fits one comfortably. If you are going to be 2 in the sofa bed, be prepared to be close! Also, there were insufficient covers on the sofa bed. The bedroom (separate) was small but perfectly acceptable and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. Not that it was such a great hotel, it's a nice hotel. But I thought it was great value. Review #66:Just spend 1 night at this hotel but it was my 3rd stay here, other stays were 4-5 nights, and as usual was quite pleased with everything..On arrival my friend and myself were greeted by a warm welcome. Our room was on the 22nd and this gave us an amazing view, although I am afraid of heights, my friend loved it. The suite was very clean and well kept as usual. Very nice stay with the wonderful location. Very quiet in the hotel during our stay, noise from outside but you expect that in a city that size. One problem still remains though are those strange washer/ dryer machines, as I still cannot figure them out and others say the same. Review #67:I stayed at the Sandman Suites for 3 nights in October. The entire experience at the hotel was a great one. The front desk check in was quick and easy with knowledgeable staff. (Though the decor in the lobby is quite strange, but it's personal taste.) We got up to our room on the 18th floor and the view was amazing! We had the perfect view of the north shore mountains on one side and English Bay on the other (it made for a beautiful photograph). The room was moderately spaced but was decorated beautifully and everything looked brand new. The bed was extremely comfortable, which is very important in what everyone looks for in a hotel! The housekeeping service was excellent and fast and very accommodating with when to return to have the room made up. The only complaint I have with this hotel was the bathroom was fairly tiny...it was clean and everything worked perfectly, just not so spacious. The spa at the hotel was very nice. The staff were friendly and welcoming and put you at ease as soon as you walk in the door. All in all, we had an excellent stay and would love to go back again for our next trip. Review #68:Don't be fooled by the super-glamour hall of this hotel...soon you will discover that the rooms are equipped with plywood furniture and that they would need a refurbishment. We had to ask for help beacause we were not able to open the french window but it turned out that it was blocked, so we had to move to another room because we needed some fresh air inside the room. The kitchenette and the washing machine are very handy, and the view form the window is really nice, but all in all we would not come back in this hotel. Review #69:My best friend and I are looking for an en-suite 1BR hotel where one who snores would sleep in the bedroom and the one who doesn't would sleep on a pull-out bed. We couldn't afford separate rooms and so we googled around to find an en-suite BR just like Embassy Suites. Our priceline.com search populated this result and we called their local number and verified that all their rooms are en-suite BR with pull-out sofa bed on the living room. The rooms are exactly as they were in the pictures: up to date and clean. There is a kitchen complete with dishwasher, microwave, oven, washer-dryer combo unit, and pressing iron. There are even dishwashing liquid, utensils, and chinas provided. Even though I get to sleep in the pull-out sofa bed, there is a separate closet by the washer-dryer for me to store luggage and equipment, a surprise but a nice thought. The location is perfect. We didn't realize it's on the \"rainbow\" stretch of Davie Street, and that was perfectly fine but may be bothering for some bigots (we're strait and only in town for Whistler and Grouse skiing). There were good food around the corner: we ate Indian, Arabic, Mediterranean, Chinese and Filipino food. Pacific Place mall and Canada Place is a mile or a little more from this location but given the food we eat is considered an exercise. Parking is not free but not a rip-off either. However, because of lofty tax, it could cost you a lot as we drove from Seattle, crossed the border into Canada and stayed here for our ski vacation in Whistler, Grouse Mountain and side trip to Victoria and around Vancouver. We didn't have much interaction with staff except for the check-in and out and so we cannot gauge their friendliness beyond that. Review #70:Stayed 3 nights at the Sandman Davie. The room was good with a great view from the outside balcony - Stanley Park (10 min walk) and the City (15-20 min walk). Location is lively, loads of restaurants/cafes within walking distance. C Restaurant was a ten min walk and Bin 941 Restaurant was a 5 min walk - both are highly recommended! Room itself had a separate sitting room / kitchen but the decor is a bit dated and probably in need of a revamp. We did have a problem with the sheets and duvet cover on our first night - the sheets were laundered but still had dark spot stains on them and the duvet cover had large coffee stains all over it. This was at midnight but the valet was sent up to change the sheets and the manager offered us free breakfasts for the duration of our stay as an apology for the lack of care. Other than that instance, we found the room to be clean. The breakfast was very good and can be taken up to a leisurely 2pm at the weekend. Review #71:After living in Vancouver for nearly 18months, we needed a place to stay the last couple of nights before heading back home. We were happy at this hotel. Nice sized rooms, with kitchenette and balcony. Staff were friendly and compared to other hotels in Vancouver- the price is good value. Great to have the restuarant chain Moxies downstairs (I'm obsessed with their bellinis!). I loved the location in downtown, its close to shops, yaletown, false creek, english bay and stanley park. However some people who are more challenged in the walking department might find some locations of stanley park, robson st, coal harbour and gas town a bit too far to walk from this hotel (not me tho! - nearly all locals walk from A to B in Vancouver). But public transport is not an issue in Vancouver (well some what). ENJOY BEAUTIFUL VANCOUVER! Review #72:My teenaged daughter and I spent 5 nights at the Sandman Suites. We had asked in a note on our reservations for the best room/view we could get without paying extra and we got a lovely room on the 23rd floor. The suite with full kitchen was an excellent value. Everyone, from the front desk to the maid service was friendly and helpful. The location was perfect. Many good restaurants and grocers nearby, and walking distance to ferries and busses to everywhere else. The only negative was that the free wireless didn't work in the front room, but when I plugged it in in the bedroom it did. It would have been nice to do my computer work at the desk instead of the bed. Review #73:I have stayed at this Sandman location several times now and it is definatly far superior to the other Sandman Hotel located across from GM Place. We had a nice city view room, which included a separate bedroom, kitchen, two tv's and a balcony. The room was clean and very well appointed, it was not luxurious but very clean and modern looking. The outdoor pool is very nice as well as the spa area. The staff were super friendly and the food at Moxies was great. The location is ideal if you are into Davie St. close to lots of restaurants, bars, and trendy shops. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to Robson St. shopping, and less than a 10 minute walk to English Bay beach. The view from the room was superb and I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a nice place to stay downtown that is not overly expensive. Review #74:I reviewed nearly every 3-5 star Vancouver hotel on TripAdvisor before finally selecting Sandman Suites Davie. We were looking for something under $200/night in a convenient area with amenities that would allow for us not to have to dine out for every meal. Though our 'city view' room on the 8th floor did not have a spectacular view, it was okay -- with a view of the Davie area. We were going to ask to move up a few floors until the fire alarm went off and we had to walk down the stairs. The staff kept those of us wandering around outside the lobby doors informed and we were impressed to see a letter of apology from management posted on the inside of the elevators just shortly after the \"all-clear\" was given. As some other reviewers have noted, the elevators were VERY slow, the alley entrance was not entirely desirable, and sometimes the cleaning staff forgot to replace towels. But, generally the room was clean (and I'm very picky), the front-desk staff were friendly and helpful, and valet personnel were efficient. Our suite had a small kitchen with refrigerator, stove, microwave, kettle, dishware, utensils, etc. Very convenient. There were some very loud guests on our floor one night, but we did not attempt to get hotel staff to remedy the situation, so can't really complain about that. Location to sights was very good... we were able to walk to many of our destinations. Review #75:Stayed here for 3 nights in Sept'11. Everything about the hotel is small; lobby, rooms, bathroom, elevator. I wouldn't consider that a bad thing, just a fact. Room was a clean and tidy suite. No cobwebs in the corners or dust bunnies that I could see. Nice little suite with bathroom with typical sink, toilet, shower/bath. Bedroom was mostly bed with about 2ft on left & right with a dresser with non-LCD TV balanced on top at the foot. Living room was a fold out couch (didn't use), desk area and kitchen counter/bar. Kitchen was fridge/freezer, stove, micro, coffee maker. Pots, plates, cups for 4 people in the cupboards. Had washer/dryer in the closet. Worked but took 4.5hrs for a couple of pants to wash/dry. Bed was comfortable. Reasonable pillows and blankets were soft, not scratchy like you sometimes find. AirConditioner is noisy but from the bedroom it was just white noise. Alternative was to open the balcony door and street noise was a little less (16th floor). Free Internet. Not cheap hotel restaurant (Moxies) but why bother with so much nearby. Room was \"04\" and was near elevators. Sitting in living room sounded like someone was constantly rolling their wheeled carry-on up and down the hall but it was the elevators. Not loud, just something you might notice and then could ignore. A nice, suitable, comfortable room in a very ideal location. Fact that it is a suite was just a bonus, allowing me to use the fridge and freezer. About 20 steps from any kind of restaurant you can imagine and pretty much central location to anything in north, south, east or west Vancouver. Review #76:Great location, room facilities good, pool great, staff exceptionally helpful. Only downside is noise from the extractor fan above the night club next door - just stay on the pool side or high up then there's no problem - staff happy to change rooms. Gives you the option of self catering right in the heart of Vancouver. Overall very good - we would use again. Review #77:The Sandman Suites on Davie in Vancouver was the place we stayed when we went to a wedding. The hotel did not have an entrance on Davie, so we had to go around to the back alley to get in. The neighborhood had some questionable peep show locations, and the streets were full of \"ladies of the evening\". The hotel itself had a great restaurant - on the young side - and the rooms were small. Advertising themselves as suites was quite surprising - two rooms that when put together could be one room in another hotel. We checked for bedbugs, but thankfully there were none. Although nothing bad happened during our stay, we would be hard pressed to return. The views from our balcony were wonderful of the Vancouver harbor, but that was its only saving grace. Review #78:These suites were a low point in an otherwise great trip. The location is yards from the gay quarter with lots of bars and clubs, but also yards from the red light district - being propositioned on your way home from dinner is not fun. The first room we were shown did not have functional heating. When the manager attempted to rectify this a large chunk of piping came away from the wall. We asked to be moved. The second room stank of smoke. The hotel management assured us it was a non-smoking suite, but the stench suggested otherwise. They showed us to a third suite which we accepted out of desperation. It had a toilet unit propped up by folded beeer mats which rocked every time it was used. The french windows did not fully close, leaving us with an icy draft and a lot of noise. We complained and were offered a small discount of a breakfast in the restaurant. Insult added to injury - we sought breakfast elsewhere. On departure we complained again and were told we could claim 15% of our next stay. It's an offer we wont be taking up, I was devastatingly disappointed that such a lovely city was ruined by a horrible hotel. Review #79:The Sandman Suites on Davie is a great place to stay for anyone looking for a great location in Vancouver. It is clean, modern, and has great service. While we were there, some unusual things happened (no water and broken elevator) during the busy Canada Day weekend. Despite these issues ( I had to wash my feet in the kitchen sink), I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and I will definetely stay at this hotel in the future! Review #80:We had a really good stay here while in Vancouver. The room (or suite!) was lovely nice amount of space good view from our blacony we stayed with our daughter who had a fold down sofa bed in the lounge - this did actually take a lot of room up - but was fine for us - the only minor problem was we were only given towels for two despite booking for three the area is in the middle of Vancouvers 'gay village' - it is also within walking area of the water and downtown We did find the carpark a little bit hard to find and get into Breakfast was served next door at the adjoining 'Moxie's Bar and Grill' It was basic but a fine start to the day We were there in the summer and our daughter really enjoyed the swimming pool which she had to herself All in all the stay was really good - the reception staff were very helpful and I would recommend this hotel to all Review #81:The location was excellent, it is right next to a busy fruit market and right across the street is a shoppers drug mart. A TON of restaurant within 5 minutes of walking, including an amazing Greek restaurant that you have to wait 45 minutes to get into. The hotel itself was very good. Everything was fairly new and very clean. The suite I was in had hardwood floor and the appliances look new. They have a tiny washer/dryer in one that is convenient for those staying a bit longer. I stayed with my family so the suite made it feel more like home. The view from the 23rd floor was breathtaking. If you are looking to take a \"Big Bus\" city tour, one of their stops is down the street. Also, all the main buses that bring you to touristy places go a long the street as well. Review #82:We loved staying at the Sandman Suites on Davie st. First of all, for the price it was an unbelievable value! It\u2019s totally worth what we paid (we bought it on expedia) as it was much better than we expected! the suites were very clean, loved having the kitchen and all the amenities, free wireless, it was very secure, & the staff were very friendly. We got upgraded to a King oceanview suite which was pretty sweet! the view was fabulous. The only problem we had was a minor problem with the shower but that was fixed very promptly. The best thing about this hotel was its location! it was right the middle of Davie st, which was always full of activity, very safe, walking distance to everything downtown, lots of amazing and interesting restaurants nearby (must try Banana Leaf on Denman st for amazing Malaysian food -- a member of front desk recommended it to us -- and also Lolita\u2019s and Bin 949 on davie), the beach (English bay) within 15 min walk, Yaletown within 15 min, Robson st within 10 min, a Shoppers across the street, Cob\u2019s bread right next door, lots of grocery stores within 5 min walk. We never ate at the Moxies downstairs or ordered room service, but that was pretty convenient to have - we just preferred eating at unique, independent restaurants rather than franchises. It was totally worth it and much better than some other pricier hotels that I had friends staying at (who were not happy with them). Plus we had excellent weather the days we were there so couldn\u2019t ask for more! :) Review #83:The suite was quite spacious, lobby and check-in also quite good. Everything (bath, kitchen, bedroom) very clean, the bed comfy, but I was glad we didn't have to use the aircondition. We switched it on, and it was super noisy (you don't hear the street sounds any more, though). The whole building is a bit dated, esp. the windows are old and don't keep any noise out. The area is ok, lots of cafes and restaurants around, location convenient for any downtown things you might want to see. Review #84:My friend and I spent one night, but I would happily return to this hotel because of the fair price, friendly staff, clean suite and great location - Stanley Park and the ferry to Granville Island are within walking distance and there's a great little bakery just two doors down. The neighborhood is just funky enough to be interesting without being totally over-the-top. Review #85:We stayed three nights and found this to be a good base for exploring the city. The desk staff were extremely helpful. The room was basic but clean and we liked the full kitchen. Our experience in the restaurant next door was really different from other reviewers', since our orange juice came right on time and we had sausages every morning. All in all, it is a good value for a centrally located hotel in a lively area. Review #86:Booked this hotel through an agent for a two night post-cruise stay in Vancouver. It was one of the cheaper options but we were assured it was a good standard and the fact it was a suite as opposed to a room swayed our decision. On arrival there was a mix up in the booking and we were hastily allocated a room on the seventeenth floor which afforded great views over the city and beyond to the mountains and the sea. The reception staff could not have been nicer. We were told that this room represented an upgrade but to be honest it didn't seem much different to rooms that the rest of our party were staying in on the eighth floor save for a slightly bigger bed. However, it was good enough if a little bit of a squeeze when the sofa bed was out. The bathroom was well supplied with toiletries though the towels were on the thin side. The attached Moxies restaurant was a hit with all our party and there are several others in the immediate neighbourhood to choose from as well. Just one point about that neighbourhood, though. The hotel is situated right in the middle of Davie Village which is Vancouver's gay area. It was surrounded by a number of adult shops displaying merchandise that some might find offensive. We had no problems with it but families with young children night want to take this into consideration. The downtown area of Vancouver is pretty compact and the hotel is within a short walk of most of it. If you want luxury choose somewhere else but if you just want a reasonable room and are happy with the location, the Sandman Suites are worth considering. Review #87:We stayed here for 6 days, excellent value. Good kitchen and bathroom. Sofabed ok although it was in the lounge. Bedroom v comfortable. We were on 21st floor and had amazing views - both in the dyatime and at night. The Davie area has plenty going on - 24 hr shops, good restauarnts. Also handy to walk to false Creek and get the ferry to Granville Island. We really enjoyed our stay here. Review #88:This is the second time we stayed at this hotel. This visit was better than the first, because of the completed gym and health spa located on the 3rd floor. The gym itself is small but very well appointed with aerobic equipment, free weights and machines. All equipment is of very high quality. We were impressed and all was included in the rate. We found the front desk staff very friendly upon check in and check out. Fast and efficient. We paid a little more this time for a room on the 18th floor with a view of the ocean...What a view! The suite was somewhat small, for more than 2 people. 3 people might find it a bit of a squeeze, but then again, how much time do you spend in the room. We found the bathroom smaller than you would find in other hotels. The hotel is located in a trendy part of Vancouver, away from some of the seediness of Granville street. The hotel is a very easy walk to alot of the shopping in Vancouver. Granville Island is close by. If you are not in a hurry, you are can also walk to Stanley Park; its a little bit of a walk 30-40 minutes or so...but you can also catch a bus which will take you there. They have a free internet connection available in the room as well, which was a little slow at times...but for reading email, it was fine. I would definately stay here again. Compared to other hotels in the area, I question if you will find the same value for money, especially if you book one of the lower internet rates available at the Sandman website. Review #89:We stayed in this hotel at the end of a long tour of Canada so choose it as it was a suite and allowed us to cook after eating out for 3 weeks. We got a suite on the 23rd floor which allowed a view of the Vancouver harbour area and mountains which was beautiful. The suite was very well equipped, it even included a washing machine which was a blessing for us rapidly running out of clean clothes. Everything was within walking distance that we wanted to see too. The reception is very trendy looking and the staff were very helpful. This hotel allowed for a very nice end to a holiday. Review #90:We chose this hotel because we had a week in Vancouver before a cruise and wanted the laundry and kitchen facilites - much prefer to cater my own breakfast. The rooms are compact but very well equipped - full kitchen including dishwasher and washer/dryer, sofa in living area and excellent, included internet access. I agree that the unit is not scrubbed clean daily but we are not messy so it was not an issue. We had a problem with locks that was dealt with and we found the front desk staff to be polite and helpful.. Lifts still tend to be slow at times - guess they need a new computer control system. As other have said, well located and bus stop 50 yards away. We were well satisfied. Review #91:Great value for money. We had a 18th floor king size suite facing the ocean, balcony present for those who don't suffer from vertigo. Washing machine, fridge freezer, good cooking facilities, dishwasher (with powder) and decent shower.Hotel staff very helpful and friendly. Just ask, if you require transport or tourist info, if they don't know they'll find it on the internet. Lounge/ kitchen area spacious, carpet a bit grubby. Bed comfortable and big. Tv's in lounge and bedroom. Overall very comfortable. Location great for food, some bars had great atmosphere although drinking coffee seems to be more of a Vancouver past time than drinking booze , a Starbucks or equivalent on every street corner - no exaggeration. Highly recommend Granville market, if you can name every single fruit you see you must work there!! Try a Dragon fruit or a Persimmon. Buy an oyster shucker and a dozen oysters from the Lobster man shop sit on a bench and enjoy the view on the marina, and tuck in with surreptitious bottle of vino blanco. Review #92:The rooms were very small. No in-room internet access. I was very surprised by this. They have a business center and will let you use their PC for 30 minutes. I was in there for 5 minutes and when the shift changed the next guy on staff came in yelling at me and wanted to know how long I had been on the PC and WHO let me in there without signing the book! It was the manager who let me in because I was checking the airline for my lost luggage. This alone will keep me from EVER going back! No resturaunt. Clothes got \"locked\" in the dryer and the manager had to call the company and get a bunch of codes to punch in to get our clothing out. With all of this they have the NERVE to charge for parking??? I recently stayed in a suite that was $69 a night and got free breakfast AND free parking! Housekeeping personel were lovely from the supervisor all the way down. They were all so sweet and the only thing that made our stay tolerable. Most of the staff was very friendly except for the one character that ruined my trip by humiliating me in the business room. But the few friendly people who worked there do not make up for 1. No Internet 2. No free parking 3. No breakfast 4. Tiny rooms 5. Rude staff I have never written a review before but this one deserved it!! ! Review #93:It's not a pretty hotel from the outside, but I was pleasantly surprised by the spacious 1 bedroom suite (considering it's downtown vancouver). Room was very clean and fantastic view over English Bay. Very useful to have the kitchen facility so you don't always have to eat out (plus you can cook some of the fab food you can get at Granville Market). The location is slightly out of the glitzy downtown scene, but more in a vibrant \"real\" downtown full of small restaurants, shops and people who actually live in the city so we felt we got a better feel for the city. We felt very safe walking around. It's very handy for bus travel and also the mini ferries on false creek. Only slight downside is some rooms will have noise from the lift shaft as it's a very tall but narrow hotel. Review #94:We found Sandman Suites to be ideal for our stay in Vancouver. We made good use of the kitchen and laundry facilities in the suite. There was also much useful storage space for clothes and suitcases. The suite had a combined kitchen and living area with desk and sofa, and a separate bedroom, which shared the balcony. The supermarkets and bakeries were very close by so we could stock up on food for our own meals in the suite. We had a corner suite which gave us good views up Davie Street and across the city skyline. The outdoor pool was fairly small but was heated and we enjoyed making use of that every day. There was also a steam room available. We found it a good value place to stay, and very convenient for walking to most parts of downtown Vancouver. Review #95:This hotel is in a good location for all parts of town. Walking distance to everything from Robson st, to Gastown, to stanley park. We were upgraded on arrival for an extra $10 a nite to a room with balcony and city view . Fully equipped kitchen , separate bedroom etc. Very clean. Hotel has pool and full spa facilities. Pool is nice but no atmosphere up there. Reception staff were really helpful. Parking is an extra $21a night which is a bit much . The area itself is the gay area of vancouver so be prepared for lots of gay bars etc and the \"adult shops\" accross the road . Vancouver itself seems a bit run down in parts and there are a lot of homeless people around . The hotel is near the hospital and for a lot of the night you will hear the ambulance and police sirens going . Also the AC is not very modern and is very noisy. So turn it on during the day when you are out - cos you wont sleep during the night with it on , between that and the sirens ............ Review #96:I loved the sandman! it was great with a super great price to match. When we arrived we were on the 18th floor and they upgraded us to the 22nd floor. They said it was a bit bigger. The bedroom and bathroom is small but it wasnt a big deal to me at all. Came with cooking pots, pans, silverware, ect. DONT park in their parking lot. They charge $18 A DAY to park! If you do down to the parkign lot by the Value Save market, its like $35 for 5 days or something like that. Either way you will save tons of money. Its only a block away! If you are facing the front entrance of the hotel, it is on your right side across the street, adjacent to the Value save, you wont miss it. They cleaned our room everyday and we never had to call them. Great location with a starbucks and a cobb bread store (yum), and plenty of restaurants around. Very convient spot in my opinion and i would certainly stay there again. Review #97:Hotel was decent enough, trendy lobby area. One bedroom suite was quite small, tiny little bathroom that steamed up pretty nicely after shower. Made a mistake of using the built-in clothes washer/dryer....never did get the clothes dry, had to leave with damp clothes in plastic bags. Decent $20 parking rate. Review #98:This review is long overdue. We chose Sandman on Davie for the location and price, and we were surprised beyond all expectations. The entire staff was very friendly and professional While checking in, a member of the staff showed us several rooms so we could pick the one we liked the best (must not have been full, but a very nice gesture!). The hotel looks a little older on the outside, but our suite was a one-bedroom king bed facing the bay and mountains. There was a full kitchen (fridge, oven/range, microwave, large sink) and plenty of dishes. The entire suite was hardwood floors and the balcony was amazing. There were flat screen TVs in the living area and bedroom, as well as an office desk with Internet connection (wireless or LAN). My partner and I got married in our suite and the commissioner actually said she would buy the suite if it was a condo. We walked to Stanley Park and rented bikes, got beers and appies along the way. There's also a liquor/beer store, grocery store, $1 store, and many convenience stores within easy walking distance. Also, a lot of restaurants and bars. We stayed 4 nights and were sad to leave. The staff remembered my partner (husband now) and me and were very warm every time we met. The view of the mountains, bay and cityscape, along with the staff and location, made this the perfect place to stay for our trip (and well within our budget) and we WILL stay here the next time we're in Vancouver! ! Review #99:Stayed here in August for the our first trip to Vancouver. Great location for bars and restaurants, ten minutes walk from English Bay Beach. Staff very helpful, rooms clean and the kitchens are well stocked. This is very handy if you take a doggy bag from a restaurant. Davie Street can be busy at night but the hotel is well away from the noise. Would definitely stay there again.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

I was pleasantly surprised to find a newly renovated room. The bed had a pillow-top, fitted sheets that stayed put during the night, and comfortable pillows. The bathroom was quite nice, with marble countertop, a full sized hair dryer, and several small shelves to keep my toiletries. The one strange thing was the lack of a bathroom door, but the front desk assured me that this is temporary and due to the recent renovations (the doors were delayed in being delivered), and only single travelers are given rooms without a bathroom door. I had a problem with my thermostat the first night and it was fixed quickly. I only ate breakfast in the restaurant, and found it adequate. Review #1:Conference I was attending and presenting at was based here, so I made a reservation directly with the hotel. Not cheap but not outlandish - very straightforward. . Incredibly central, convenient location at the X'ing of two of Toronto's major avenues and subway lines. Land is dear, which explains why the reception, bar and breakfast restaurant are the only hotel spaces on the ground floor (adjoining the subway station) and the \"1st Floor\" is 6 flights above. My room had a dreary view of internal \"garden\" (i.e., an outdoor smoking space). . Check-in was adequate. I had a minor problem with my room service sandwich (missed the deadline to get \"a real meal\") which was fixed. The conference food that was served was above average. Room fixtures, upkeep and the housekeeping were outstanding. Note that unlike in the states, many of the Marriott rooms and spaces in this hotel were \"smoking\" - yuck. Still, my non-smoking room was ok. Bed was fantastic. Lighting was good. Bathroom excellent. . While Marriott quality was present and the service was good, nothing about this hotel (except its location at the Bloor and Young St. intersection) blew me away. I would stay here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Review #2:In needed a nice hote lto stay at in the downtown Toronto area, while visiting friends. I usually prefer Marriott as they have always been a trusted hotel, that exceeds the service I look for in a hotel. The hotel is situated in a nice area in the Yorkville subdivision right off of Bloor Street. You have the fine shopping at your finger tips right up the street, which was beyond convenient. The Eaton Centre, CN Tower, and all the nice major attractions are all within distance, which made this hotel very suitable for me. When entering upon the hotel, the staff was nothing but friendly and inviting awaiting to assist you. The lobby had been renovated not too long ago, and looked rather lovely as did the guest rooms. The beds were super relaxing and comfortable and provided a good nights rest during my entire stay. I did have the opportunity to see how their room service was, and everything was perfect. The restaurant Matissa in the Hotel was priced a pinch cheaper then the hotels room service, as the food was delicious. I went there almost daily for a bowl of the soup of the day. Cannot wait for my return back to Toronto to visit my friends, as I will be making this officially hotel of choice each time I visit. Review #3:My Spanish friend and I stayed in this hotel for two nights (Aug. 14 and 15, 2011). It's the first time that my friend came to Canada. She couldn't speak English and my spoken English is so so. We were very impressed with the excellent services this hotel provided. A couple of examples, We were not familiar to Toronto at all. We wanted to take the subway. After we asked a lady working in the lobby of the main entrance that hotel, she was so nice to accompany us to the subway station connected to the hotel. Farahna, a very nice girl who was working in the front desk of that hotel, was so kind to provide all the info about the \"City tour\" we were interested in and booked it for us. Even a very nice man working in the housekeeping department of the hotel did help me a lot when I saw him in the hallway of the floor and asked him a few questions about Toronto. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard for a tourist in a city like Toronto that he or she is not familiar with at all. A help, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a trivial one, can make a big difference. My friend and I had a wonderful time and unforgettable memory about the hotel. We will come back and would like to recommend it to our friends and relatives. Thanks a lot. Qiong Dai Review #4:Literally above the metro and right on Bloor (the Bond street of Toronto) the location is very good. The bed is very comfy and massive, room is nice but nothing special. Restaurant had great service but only average food. Get the internet and breakfast included for about 4 bucks, well worth it. A good place if you're not going to be spending much time there, or to hold a convention at. Review #5:This is not my first visit to the Marriott Bloor Yorkville. The location of the hotel is why I have selected it in past and why I selected it again this time. I'm not sure that I was expecting a lot of change in the hotel and I wasn't disappointed -- nothing has changed since my last stay three years ago. The price is good; the location is what I wanted; the rooms are large and well appointed. However, given everything, I can only give the hotel an Average. Here's why: The internet is only free in the lobby. I still can't understand why hotels do not have free internet -- build it into the cost of the room. Towel are a three on a scale of five. Not thread-bare but not fluffy either. Bed is fairly comfortable but not pillow-topped mattress. Again, just a three. I had such a bad experience with breakfast the last time I stayed at this Marriott, I didn't even give it a chance this time. Thus, no \"scrambled egg\" test. I walked over to Flo's Diner for breakfast. Water pressure in the shower is \"just OK\". Having said all of this, I probably will stay here again. But, I sure wish they would change their policy on internet availability. Review #6:I have been staying at this hotel almost weekly since August of 2011 and have never been disappointed. The hotel staff, especially the front desk and Consigner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lounge staff, provides timely and effective service. The staff is always pleasant and more than willing to help. The Hotel itself is clean and reasonably well kept. The subway is available directly underground to the hotel as is a shopping plaza complete with food court. There a several excellent restaurants within walking distance and for those adventurous souls Yonge St is just around the corner. Review #7:There is one main reason you choose this hotel: location. It is located at the junction of the Yonge and Bloor subway lines and is also right on the PATH. But despite this central location, it was still a ride to go to any of the attractions or evening hotspots. The rooms were decent, the staff was courteous, but nothing out of the ordinary. While there is nothing specific that would make me rate this hotel negatively, for business or tourists, I would recommend staying closer to Eaton Centre or Union Station. If you're in the suburbs and still want subway access, consider North York. For the price, this hotel is only passable. Review #8:Stayed here in a suite for 3 nights from August 10. Shortly after arriving early evening the fire alarm went off meaning we had to walk down 10 floors to reception and wait until given the all clear after the Toronto Fire Dept had inspected and found nothing. The following late afternoon, the same thing happened. On Friday morning there was a power cut which lasted from 0730hrs until sometime after 1145hrs (when we left the hotel for the day having had to use the bathroom by torchlight to get ready for the day). Again, we had to walk down 10 floors to exit the hotel. On Saturday morning, whilst preparing to check out, the fire alarm went off again at approximately 1100hrs. The building was evacuated, the Toronto Fire Dept turned up and again the all clear was given some time later. When we raised these issues with the manager, we were told that people had been smoking in the stairwell and therefore they were not false alarms and we were offered 5,000 Marriott points and the extra charge for our kid's rollaway bed was removed from the bill! Not good enough Marriott...this hotel is a disgrace to the brand and you need to do better. Secondary to this: the room was fine, housekeeping was good (and their job was made especially difficult by the constant disruption) but could not be sure as to the true nature of the view out towards Bloor as the windows were so filthy. Would not stay here again and do not recommend for reasons above. Review #9:my girlfriend and I stayed down here on the Friday of thanksgiving weekend after getting a great price on line last minute . We checked in at 7 pm very quickly and very politley by the check in desk. went into our room and showered. The bathroom was a bit small but very nicley decorated and very clean. left for the night and came back after midnight to go to bed. The bed was a king and was soft and comfortable and there was no noise to be heard in the halls or other rooms. woke up at 10 am and checked out at 10:45. The hotel has no ppol which was a disappointment but had a very well equipped gym. This is an excellent hotel if you are looking for a very nice room, comfy bed, and just a place to leave your suitcase if you can get it for a good price but not recommended for families trying to keep kids entertained . great location though for shopping and sight seeing as its connected right to the TTC Subway Review #10:I reserved this hotel with Priceline at a fantasitic rate, so when I received it, I had some hestitation as I had read some rather bad past reviews of this property. Plus as a Priceline customer, I assumed I would be getting a less desireable room. Well I was wrong. Check had a slight wait. I was given a room on the VIP floor. The room was a king non-smoking. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. It was very clean and fresh. Amenities included a robe, coffee and tea and high quality shampoos and soaps. Some people may have complained about the walk from the elevator. Yes, it was quite far, but if you are able to walk, I don't see a problem. A little exercise wouldn't hurt. Another big plus is the 1PM check out. The location is perfect. Right above underground shopping and subway. Parking is available for $15.00 a day, but I used the one across the street as the hotel's do not have in-out privileges. But if you are just going to be downtown, leave the car and walk or use the subway. I was ready to give this hotel 5 stars. I had put washed some clothes and when I went down to get them, my key card would not work. I called the front desk and they said they would send someone up. I waited 15 minutes, called again and they again said someone would be right up. A guest opened the door for me. When I got my clothes, I found the card would not work in the room. I found out at 1PM, the cards are de-activated. I am not sure if it is all rooms or just \"Priceline rooms\". I think some hotels do this, if they do it is not in their best interest to satisfy guests. Given the small problem, I would recommend this hotel Review #11:Stayed on business and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. King bed was extremely comfortable with a selection of both soft and hard pillows. Room was spacious and immaculate, staff was always helpful with directions and service. Room service was very prompt. Also extremely important, the location is very central (Bloor & Yonge), subway is right downstairs, as well as a small mall. This hotel is walking distance to shopping, restaurants, and there is a grocery store right next door. Review #12:While staying in this hotel someone broke into our room wile my boyfriend and I were sleeping and stole all of our money and credit cards. I am assuming it had to have been an inside job and that they were a professional pickpocket because we did not hear them. The hotel did nothing to help us except for a complimentary breakfast. The hotel proved to be completely unconcerned that this could happen to one of their customers while staying in one of their hotels. I will never stay in a Marriott hotel again. I strongly advise to look elsewhere for a hotel when staying in Toronto. I can not go back in time and change what happened to me but hopefully I can help make sure that this does not happen to someone else Review #13:Most important note: Unless you are only staying in Toronto, get a hotel OUTSIDE the city. The parking fee is extremely high (some underground garage). It's almost 30 dollars. Spaces are all tight and limited. People were nice. Location was good. Right above the underground mall area. Room was kind of far, was a trek to get there. The rooms were pretty fair though. It's what you would expect. Some burnt out bulbs. A little dusty on the shelves and such. Good place to stay, but if you are renting/bringing a car, rent outside the city and drive in because you are going to get killed with parking fees. I think it's only worth it here if you plan on not having a car. Review #14:You can't beat the super convenience of this Bloor Yorkville property. Right next door is an extensive indoor walkways that connect to the entire Bloor Yorkville area. In winter months, we really appreciated the warm walkways lined with food, shops and service outlets.Grab a coffee and doughnut on the go, drop off some laundry, top up your phone plan, get a massage, send flowers? Right there! The best is that the entrance of Marriott is 30 paces from one of the Bloor Yonge subway entrances. bingo, you go everywhere on the TTC system. With all these, we could put up a bit with the less than luxurious decor: the room is large sized, the gym outstanding and yes, even Matisse, the breakfast place downstairs is pretty good for a catchup place for coffee with friends. Review #15:Hotel rooms start at 6th floor. Expensive weekday hotel parking down in Basement levels which is actually above ground garage levels on top of street level Bays shopping mall. Weekend hotel parking is CN$25 per day, weekday at 40. Downstairs ground level Bays Shopping mall have 2 food courts, but was closed every time we were looking for dinner. Quite expensive restaurants at within this block west areas along Yonge Street. More reasonably price restaurants are on the east side along Mount Pleasant Road areas. Subway station entrances are beneath the shopping mall. Downstairs garage levels on top of the Bay shopping mall is under construction. Loud jack hammer going all day till 5pm including Saturday. No warning on web site. Only told customers at check in, kept saying it is not their fault. Avoid turning right existing garage, Bloor street is dug up for extensive construction. Massive grid lock. Got 5 rooms at good prices at Priceline.com for weekend. Avoid rooms near elevators (room with low numbers) because of elevator cable knocking noises. Excellent room furnishing. Large LCD flat screen TV, but only typical few hotel channels, and shown in lowest composite NTSC resolution, what a shame. No mini-refrigerators or mini-bar or microwave. Hate shower without flow volume control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only one setting in full blast and waste of water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stupidest American invention. Mini-safe and coffer maker. Stiff sheets. One type of blanket in dawn feather. Tough for Californians unable to overnight adjust to this. Can only sleep next night by cooling the room down below 60. Competent staff at registration. Room internet charge $13.60 per day. But free wifi at lobby, what a hassle, I guess encourage hotel elite rating. Breakfast buffet at $17.50. Good fitness. Business center allow free printing of airline boarding pass. Review #16:Very typical hotel, nothing special. Rooms are good size, yet mediocre in design & amenities. Circular floor layout, make for a long walk to some rooms. I stayed for a week for a business trip, we hosted our annual Sales Meeting here. The meeting rooms were nice, the service was excellent - the business concierge, the av team, the food services; would definitely recommend for business activities. The front desk and restaurant/bar were kind but to the point. A big complaint...twice during my 6 night stay we were awoken by the fire alarm and evacuation. Come to find out it was the Bunsen burners being used by the hotel staff to heat breakfast in the 4th floor corridor for another meeting. No explanations, no apologies - NOT good customer service. Review #17:Yet another Priceline shopper! Location and price were wonderful - we took the train into the city & it was so fast and inexpensive going from Union Station to the hotel in minutes for under $5!...It is a lovely, but quirky hotel. There is only one set of elevators for each mazelike floor,lovely big windows that open up to an expanse of lower roof tops or the antics of other guests caught unaware. Plusses: Location! Cold weather not a problem with the metro under the hotel. Spacious room, nicely decorated with two full club chairs, ottoman, heavenly bed and linens. Bathroom is well thought out with nice lighting, mirrors andabundant shelving - nicely scented & presented Body Shop products. Service was top knotch. Nays: The views ( non exisitent). Lack of pool or spa - would've been so welcomed after a hard foot touring day! Internet connection charges!! Am a Marriott member and didn't know the fees could've been waived. Marriott is so below the curve on charging exhorbitant fees. Hints: Longos grocers next door - thank you previous reviewer! Made up a thrifty, healthy breakfast with Starbucks coffee, yogurt, fresh fruit and whole grain muffins for a faction of room service cost! Review #18:This hotel was fine. Billing itself as a 4* property is, in my view, misleading. Why? The rooms are fine - the difference is very poor customer service. When I went to check in, I was told there were no rooms available. After the two people in line after me were able to get rooms, my argument with the desk manager managed to secure me a key. On check out, there were a series of charges for valet parking on my bill which were reversed but only after a number of phone calls to somewhere... Most of the rooms have a view of the interior \"courtyard\" with a view of the garbage strewn roof of the lobby of the hotel. Note that there is no on-site parking. Valet parking is a rip-off, you can drive the 1/2 block yourself for more than half the price. If you are pressed or get a great deal, it is fine - just don't expect much. Review #19:POSITIVE: Great spacious clean rooms. The bed was really comfortable. Huge LCD tv \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a connection board for laptops and other devices. Great location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the top of the Yorkville downtown area. Friendly staff. NEGATIVE Internet is not free \u00e2\u20ac\u201c over CAD 13 per day. No breakfast included \u00e2\u20ac\u201c over CAD 13. Paid parking (if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move the car the whole weekend it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just 15 CAD). Review #20:We stayed at the Marriott Hotel on Bloor for two nights on the 12/13th October. My first impressions were very positive - the staff were helpful, they had complied with our request for a room on a higher floor and the room when we arrived was enormous - as was the bed! It was our fist night in Toronto and we were feeling tired. We were able to walk in all directions from the hotel and find restaurants and bars, and the subway and shopping centres are literally on your doorstep. The first night was very quiet and we got a good sleep, the second night we could hear a guy in the room next door talking on his cell phone, but wehn we got back later there was again no noise and we slept well. The room and bathroom were well decorated and well appointed and extremely clean. And when we went to pick up our hire care form Avis we found out we could even access that by the elevator in the hotel - perfect! We ate out for breakfast every day at Le Pain Quotidean on Yonge just around the corner - excellent breakfast!! So no comments on quality of the hotel restaurant. As vegetarians though we found Toronto was wonderful for food!! This hotel was good value for a city hotel and ideally situated - a good introduction to Toronto! Review #21:A very nice hotel - a typical Marriott property. Although I got a deal via Hotwire, my Marriott Rewards status was honored and I received free breakfast for two, and a half bottle of local wine. The room had all the standard amenities except there was no refrigerator/mini-bar. But it's a clean and comfortable hotel and would be great in the winter as it is literally on top of the Bloor/Yonge subway station. There's a stairway/elevator directly from the lobby to the shopping mall and subway which is just a few feet away. So if you're looking for a convenient location at Toronto's busiest subway station, this hotel is for you. Review #22:I just returned from my one-week vacation in Toronto. I knew prior to my trip that I would most likely not have a room with a view. A city view was not important to me, since I would get out and see the city each day anyway. The only negative thing I have to say about this hotel is that there is no gift shop in the lobby. However there is a 24 hour grocery store right across the street from the back door of the hotel. Ok, now on to the good stuff. The room was the most comfortable, clean, and cozy room I've ever stayed in, and I've been to hundreds of luxurious hotels. The rooms look BRAND NEW because of their recent upgrades. I could have stayed in the plush bed all day just relaxing or being entertained from over 40 channels on the 27 inch TV. The bathroom was small but impressive with its new Kohler bathroom products, and like the rest of the room, it was sparkling clean. There is a nice business centre located on the 1st floor with free internet access. I did not try the restaurant because there were so many other choices right around the hotel. The location can't be beat. I will stay here every time I visit Toronto because it is located right above the Bloor-Yonge Subway Station. Just walk through the conveniently located door next to the lobby elevators and down some stairs to the subway, shopping area, and food court with over 10 restaurants. Right outside the hotel, there is more top rated shopping on Bloor Street West and Yorkville. After a full day of sightseeing, it was wonderful to come back to my quiet and peaceful room. And because most rooms face into an empty courtyard, I could look out my window and not see a person. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Toronto. Review #23:RECOMMENDED: This centrally located business class hotel lacks an impressive lobby or public areas, but for it's a solid Marriott experience. Large well maintained and renovated rooms tastefully decorated. Workable desk area and chair. Plenty of illumination throughout.. Quiet rooms and comfortable bedding complete the experience. In room wired & wireless Internet with good access speeds. Service is friendly and efficient. This is not a dazzling property but a quality property for an executive in transit. Review #24:Our stay was brief thankfully, the tv didn't work, there was construction, so not the quietest - we allegedly stayed at an upgraded room - it was code for horrible decor really. my boyfriend forgot his watch there and their explanation was well we looked and it wasn't there. not recommended - 4 stars is an over rating for that hotel- the one good thing was the beds were comfy Review #25:This hotel is right on top of the Bloor and Yonge station. It is convenient to travel by subway in just about every direction. It is not as noisy and crowded as other neighbourhoods in downtown Toronto. We have four people staying in a room with two queen beds and it doesn't feel cramped. The hotel was renovated a couple of years ago and feels quite fresh. HD TV is a pleasure to watch. The lobby is quite small and undistinctive. The front desk is not staffed as fully as it should. One Saturday afternoon, the concierge wasn't there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a bandaid. The restaurant looks dark and unappealing. Overall, nice place. Review #26:The location is GREAT...The subway is the only way to travel..This was the first time for all of us using the subway,and it was great.The people in the subway would direct you to the proper platform to where ever we wanted to go, so simple when you ask..and cheap.The subway is right under the hotel. We went there for a concert and blue jays game.There is a market right beside the hotel with everything you can imagine and fresh. Tim Hortons around the corner or up the street. Shopping and restaurants all with in walking distance..Hemmingsway restaurant is a 10 minute walk, and has 3 outdoor rooftop patios, service and food was great and good pricing.This hotel came recommended by Lisa from the Marriott in Sudbury and everything was well above our expectations.The rooms are huge and so comfortable and clean. ALL the staff are super friendly and go above and beyond every request or questions. Zlata, Diogo and Ashley were super people and made our stay even more fun. I would highly recommend this hotel.When I go back to Toronto I will stay there again. Thanks for the fun time. Sheila from Sudbury Review #27:The hotel was older, run down and the decor is way too busy. The first room they gace me which was on the 6th floor had a windoe facing a courtyard. We checked in at night and I could not see out. I woke up naked and when i turned around all I could see were people outside my window looking in. They were on a break from a convention held at the hotel. I asked to move and they moved me to the next level up. That was all they had. This room was on the corner to a all window hallway of a convention room and I woke up again the next morning with people looking in from the window of the hallway on the corner. This hotel is poorly designed! Review #28:We won this lovely hotel through Priceline by choosing a 4 star Downtown Toronto Hotel for $75 per night. We drove up to Toronto for one night from Niagara Falls before returning home to Washington DC. This hotel was very easy to locate via Mapquest directions. The bathroom was pristine as was the bedding, however the carpet has seen better days. Also the room service from the Matisse restaurant in the Lobby was adequate and fullfilling. Big plus to this hotel is the proximity to high end shopping...Louis Vuitton, Tiffanys, Gucci, Escada, COACH, Pottery Barn and so on. Also as an added convenience PATH is located underneath the hotel. Which is the underground city of Toronto and easy access to the subway. Must do in this city is a visit to the CN Tower. If you eat at the 360 restaurant the views are breathtaking and the ride up is free. Enjoy. Review #29:We were a group of friends celebrating a birthdayin the city and booked two rooms for 8 people. both rooms were nice and looked like they had been updated recently. One of the rooms had a heating issue and a hotel employee came up to look at the heater at 330am, he was very helpful. They ended up switching the room for another room across the hall where the heat wasn't blasting. The only issue i had was trying to locate the other guests in the morning, the front desk person would not tell me where they had been moved, even though it was my name on the reservation. We asked the front desk staff to recomend a breakfast place to us, which they did, but the information was outdated and the restaurant had been closed for some time. Other than that the staff were friendly and helpful. it was nice to know they were willing to help at such an early hour. I read some poor reviews, and they must have been from before some kind of reservation work was done because the lobby and the hallways, along with the rooms were clean and very nicely decorated. Review #30:Stayed for 1 night on business using a corporate rate. Booked a regular room and was upgraded to concierge. Lobby is efficient and everyone was super friendly. Check in was fast and easy. Room was on the 6th floor overlooking another building and some type of courtyard. Room was large, comfortable and very clean -- king-sized bed, desk, armoire, and reading chair with ottoman. Really appreciated the L-shaped workspace as I could spread my materials out for the presentation I had to prepare. Housekeeping had provided the extras I have listed in my Marriott rewards profile -- good sign. Bathroom was also very clean and amenities are good quality. Concierge lounge was quiet, large, and well stocked for both hors d'oeuvres and breakfast. Had dinner with a colleague in the Matisse restaurant. Food was good, not remarkable, and the service was friendly and prompt. Had the same server at breakfast and the buffet was very good with excellent healthy options. Fortunately, we won the deal and I'll be returning to this location several times over the next few weeks. I'll plan on exploring the neighborhood more next time I'm there because there are a lot of shopping, dining and entertainment options just outside the door. Review #31:Front desk staff and management attitude not even good enough for a one star hotel. Rude and unwelcomming, and did not honour my reservation even though I gave them my credit card number when I did reservation online to guarantee my reservation. They did not even attempt to fix the problem or offer alternatives. Review #32:This hotel is clean and the room which we had upgraded to was nice but dont expect a view. The hotel only has 6 floors and a lot of the rooms face an inner courtyard. The parking is terrible as work was being done on the lower levels which the communication between the hotel and the parking authority was lack there of... Everyone booking in had either parked in valet parking or ended up having to move their cars, then walk outside around the block. the signage for parking actually stinks and the bell boys don't have a clue when asking directions to the alternative parking arrangements. We were upgraded to the nicer room only cause we had to complain for at least 10 minutes regarding the ring around the rosie ie the parking. If you dont drive... this would be good for you... but if you do, then be prepared. Dont take kids here as no pool, no view and nothing for them to do. This hotel is great for a business suited person coming in from taxi or if you can well afford to pay for valet parking but be warned even there was an issue with 2 separate occasions while we were in the lobby of people having problems with the valet parking. The attendents were new, no manager on duty on the busiest night (new years eve and yet the charge was over $200.00. The hotel like I said is nice in decor... but I have seen better. If the staff were well versed on how to problem solve and if the manager was not out galavanting around when his/her staff were trying to problem solve, then I would recomend this hotel. They dont deserve the business. Review #33:Stayed 3 nights, October 2011 Priceline bid/win of $125/night...came to $150/night with taxes Priceline calls this 4stars...I say more like 3stars Pros: Location VERY close to subway stop Bathroom fixtures/finishes very nice Bath and Body Works brand toiletries Plenty of towels Good room size Safe in room Room and bathroom very clean, tub was perfectly white. Good h20 pressure. Bed and pillows very comfy Parking in Hudson Bay garage around corner was only $11/day (did this by accident!) Cons: Generic design Hallways could use updating...wall sconces very dated; ugly carpeting No great lobby No free internet access in rooms (knew that going in...) No view from room (my room at least!) and FILTHY window made it appear dark/dreary Circular design...get off elevator and walk down hall and turn, turn again, turn again, etc. Weak hairdryer Overall: Would stay again for this price but wouldn't pay more than $125/night Review #34:I arrived at the Marriott from a long overseas flight and was nicely greeted at the front door and lobby. Best thing of all, they allowed me to choose some freebies and then sent them up to my room - a snack of wine, fruit, and pretzels in my case! My room was typical Marriott, roomy, comfortable and nicely furnished. The flatscreen TV was huge! Globe and Mail in the morning, quiet night, comfy bed, lots of pillows...and a breakfast buffet that was excellent and cheaper than some. I would happily go back again. Review #35:We enjoyed the location and decor of the Marriott Yorkville. However, our room's windows were facing the courtyard where, as the receptionist told me when I called to complain about the noise, \"people go to smoke.\" There was a big group of people having a great, loud time until around 3:30 in the morning. I had asked the receptionist if it closes at a certain time so that we could get some sleep, and she said that it was the night manager's choice when to close it. She was vague and kind of rude in that she did not seem to care that the noise from these guests was bothering us. We booked this room through a third-party site. If we were to stay there again we would be sure to be far away from the courtyard. Also, they charged us for local calls! And wireless internet is not free on the weekends. Review #36:but other than that the location sucked. We booked this off of priceline, so we got a really good deal (even after having to pay for parking), but we expected to be in the middle of downtown and it was a really far walk to the big malls, the good shopping, and the nightlife. However, the hotel is right on top of both of Toronto's subway lines, so it was pretty easy to get around (and the subway is very clean - nothing like NYC). Rooms and hotel staff were so-so - by far the worst Marriott that I've stayed at, but I've always been extremely happy at Marriott. Maybe they just have different standards for Mariotts in Canada. Basically, a good deal for the price we got on priceline (80 USD/night), but I sure wouldn't pay full price for it. Review #37:Very handy to shopping, subway, Royal Ont. Museum Clean helpful staff. Self parking $25 ?day. Charge for wi-fi can be acoided by signing up fpr Marriott club. Points can be transferred to airline program. Large clean room. Large clean bathroom. Review #38:I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights by bidding on Priceline. I got a tremendous deal for the value of this hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted and were escorted to our room. We were initially given a room with 2 queen beds and were hoping for a king bed as there were just 2 of us. The lugguage attendant immediately called to the front desk and he went and got our new cards and we were lead to our new room across the hall in a few minutes. Our room was spotlessly clean and the decor was modern and fresh. The bed was humongous with about 10 pillows and comfortable linens. The products in the bathroom were \"Bath & Body\" and were of excellent quality. I felt the room service was overpriced but we took advantage of the breakfast buffet offered in the restaurantl and it was delicious and well worth the $15.99 as it included coffe and freshly squeezed orange juice. We didn't use the subway below the hotel although this is a good advantage for travellers without a car. There was a LOT of shopping within walking distance and I felt the area was safe to walk around. I would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future as we recieved a great price and the customer service was excellent and the location was great. Review #39:The Marriot on Bloor is not the best looking hotel, in fact its down right ugly. The purpose at staying at this location was to take our daughter to University. The rooms were small but nice and the location was great. We looked out our window to a courtyard of over grown plants and garbage. The lobby was small and not a place to hang out. In all the room served its purpose and the location was great at a good value. Review #40:Hi, I would like to thank Mr. Mark Manager of the hotel, who took care of the delegates came from India for the conference here in Toronto. Very well organized and the staffs are very kind of course the hotel is well maintained. Thank you very much sudarshan Faculty Bio-medical Engg Centennial College. Toronto Review #41:Our stay at this Sheraton hotel was wonderful! One of its greatest conveniences is the subway station located beneath the hotel. The front desk staff went out of their way to accommodate us, from check-in .. to questions we had during our stay .. to check-out. We found the hallways of the hotel to be clean and fresh, so many times the hallways of hotels are dingy and dark. The entire hotel is NON-SMOKING, and our guest room always had a nice, fresh smell. All guest room bathrooms were recently renovated -- very nice, even equip the bathrooms with Bath & Body Works shampoo/conditioner, bar soap and lotion. The bed was extremely comfortable, felt much like sleeping on a cloud! The on-site restuaurant, Matisse, provided a superb hot breakfast bar, with eggs/omelettes made to order. Very classy hotel, we will definitely return here for our next stay! Booked the room via Priceline and got a terrific deal. Review #42:The hotel doesn't have much to offer in terms of design features or \"experience\". One thing they can do is to get fast internet so people can get their work done. When that doesn't work, there is little point of staying there. If you don't need fast internet, the place is OK... rooms are large, TV is there, gym is bigger than one would expect... Review #43:The Toronto Marriott is bright, clean, and modern. I enjoyed the fluffy hypoallergenic feather pillows, and there were plenty of them (I often ask for extra pillows if there are only two in the room). We got a reasonably-priced room through an online website. In a good location in Toronto, walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops. Cost of parking was reasonable compared to other downtown hotels \u2013 park in the lot next door. Review #44:My cousin and I were in Toronto for a Phillies game and to experience the city for a weekend. This hotel has large rooms and appears relatively new. When traveling, I like to stay in Marriott hotels if I can. I would say this is a good Marriott hotel, but it is not the best Marriott hotel I have stayed in. The location was ok in relation to the price that we paid. Review #45:We got a great deal via hotwire.com. We traveled with another couple for a weekend getaway and didn't particularly care about the hotel, as long as it was 4 star. We were pleasantly surprised by the Marriott Bloor. Parking - this was a challenge. One of the lots was closed, but the lot under the hotel was relatively inexpensive for city parking for the weekend. Once we parked, we left the car and used the subway. If you have seen the construction on Bloor, you will not want to do much driving, either! Service - I was a little frustrated upon check in. They could not accommodate a request for two beds and, frankly, I was a little anxious from the long drive. The ladies at the desk took great care of us. One offered complimentary breakfast at Matisse simple because \"they want to see happy people at their hotel.\" By the way - the breakfast and service was great. Cute little place. The gym facilities were beyond my expectations. Several of each machine and multiple tvs. Overall, the rooms were clean, beds comfortable, and location was convenient to the subway, restaurants, and high end shopping. We were pleased with our experience, especially with the value we got using hotwire.com. Review #46:Went to Toronto to spend a few days for Gay Pride. Location was excellent. Just a few blocks from the Gay Village, Younge Street and Great shopping. Took a cab from Pearson Airport. $52.00 flat rate not including tip. Did research on TripAdvisor and it was a good choice. Last year stayed at Marriott Eaton Center which was also great but further from the activities. They were in the process of doing some construction on Bloor street which was very loud during the day but no fault of Marriott. Check-in was very quick and staff were very courteous. Elevators throughout the stay were very slow for some reason. Room was very clean and updated and carpet was very clean. Stayed in room 332. If you want a quick trip to some shopping there is a mall bellow the hotel with a food court, Starbucks, Liquor store, Drugstore and a lot of others. Free Wi-Fi in lobby with password from front desk. Carpet in room was clean. Room itself was very clean and bathroom also was clean. Room was quiet and could not hear people in rooms next door but could hear people speaking in the hallway. AC worked well. Room service was quick and prices were as you would expect from any other hotel which I thought were reasonable. Restaurant in hotel but never ate there. Only 6 floors with no windows overlooking Bloor street. Subway station below hotel. A few blocks from great designer stores/boutiques (Gucci, Prada, Tiffany, Roots, Holt Renfrow and many others). I will definitely stay there on my yearly trip to Toronto from the States. Review #47:4 gals stayed here in a room with two queen beds, was very comfortable, plenty of room for a short stay. Clean, good beds, quiet, indoor parking. In-room Coffee was awful. Excellent location for visiting downtown Toronto, subway a few steps away, close to interesting Yorkville and Bloor Street. Review #48:We recently stayed at the Marriott for five nights. Had a great time. The staff was very pleasant and helpful, the rooms clean and comfortable, and the location could not have been better. Only minutes away from shopping, restaurants, and the subway is right below the hotel. There is a great market next door when the kids needed a evening snack. The only drawback is that there is no free internet, but otherwise we would highly recommend this hotel. We would definitely stay here again. Review #49:Nicely appointed rooms, parking is difficult as you must driveto back of the hotel, and there are many one way streets. No pool. Gym with good equipment. No newspaper. Only one restaurant. Good concierge and front desk service. Valet parking is expensive. No small touches like chocolates on your pillow. Windows on the outside were dirty. Review #50:I'm normally pretty picky when it comes to hotels and accomodations. After we were able to pick up the hotel off Priceline for $118, we weren't expecting what we got... First off, we showed up early, and I figured there was no way of an early check-in (noon), but to my surprise, the very friendly woman at the desk found us a room within minutes and we were checked in very quckly. The room is very large for the price we paid. The room has been beautifully renovated recently, with a very stylish bathroom. 40\" Plasma screen, and wireless internet. The location of the hotel is as good as it gets for Yorkville. We will definitely be returning to the hotel any time we need to be in that area! Make sure you do some looking through the different online sites and get yourself a good bargain. It is well worth it! Review #51:Had to change rooms twice in three days. First there was hair in the bathroom sink that appeared to be of the pubic variety, then the shower was clogged, and the thermostat broken. My new rooms were on the first floor, and the furthest possible rooms away from the elevator! All I got for my horrific experience was free breakfast at the restaurant downstairs, but even that was a nightmare, as on the last day, I found a hair on my sausage link! I will say that the bed was extremely comfortable, but given the bad experience, that was not enough to make up for the other goings-on. Would not stay here again. Review #52:Just recently stayed at the Marriott Bloor Yorkville Hotel (Wedding June 18th) for an overnight. This hotel is clean and service is great. The rooms are nice. IThe beds are very, very comfortable. The location is excellent for shopping and dining. I would stay again and would recommend, No problem Review #53:The hotel is clean, modern and up-to-date. the room we had seemed to have been recently updated, or the hotel is practically new. There is a subway stop directly below the hotel for both the main lines in Toronto making getting around town a breeze. Review #54:We stayed one night, July 25 and found the hotel to be very comfortable. The checkin person was especially friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome. We had king room and it was very spacious with an excellent bed and lots of pillows. Bathroom was not large but clean and good showerhead. Their breakfast buffet was outstanding and we thought reasonable at $15.95. It also was convenient to have the subway right there. We took it to go out for dinner and return. We would stay here again. We weren't driving so cannot comment on the parking. However, when we departed the doorman was very pleasant in getting us the flat rate taxi we wanted to go to the airport. Review #55:Stayed here for 6 nights. Fire alarm went off after midnight, everyone had to evacuate. This is not an uncommon occurrence for this hotel. Read the previous posts from Trip members. But the hotel was comfy, great beds/linens, very clean, and roomy. THere is a grocery store adjacent to the hotel which was very convenient. I had a microwave and fridge brought to my room for the week. Shower pressure was great, very important to me. Cleaning staff could be a little more diligent about ensuring the coffee supplies were restocked each day, but that is the only complaint. Mink Mile is located on this street, so if you are in to high end shopping, this is the place to stay. However, if you have money to spend at the Mink Mile, you are probably staying is a better hotel! The court yard is pathetic. Review #56:I would give this more like a 3.5 stars only because the location is unbeatable. It is right above the subway station, undersground mall/food court and is considered \"the center\" of Toronto. If you like fine dining or expensive shopping, you can walk 5 minutes and you're there. There are also a good variety of cheap/ethnic eateries up and down Yonge St. As busy as this area is, we didn't hear any traffic noise and slept well on very comfortable beds. No problems also with cleanliness. Now for the not so good part - for a \"4 star\" hotel, you would expect nicer furnishings. Both the lobby and the rooms looked like they haven't been refurbished since the late 80s. The room we were in was not proportionate, as the suite was super large, but the bathroom was tiny in comparison. Costs for Internet ($14/day) and valet parking ($35/day) were pretty outrageous. Considering you spend over $200/night for this place, you would hope they can provide free Internet. Even lower level hotels give it away for free! Anyways, the room just didn't seem \"worth it\". If you don't care about looks, then I guess it is fine. Review #57:Really well kept hotel. Clean, spacious, beautiful rooms. The bed felt we were sleeping in a soft cloud... loved it. Nice bathroom. Check out time was at 1 pm - which was great. Right across the street was a great little restaurant called Peridot - nice ambience there. Not a noisy hotel - wasnt disturbed by anyone in the next room or in the hallway. Very pleased with the choice and our stay. Review #58:I found here is nothing particularly redeeming about this hotel, which several reviewers seem to love. The location isn't great for business downtown and basically they took a shabby old hotel did some renovation work to make it acceptable but I think the end result was quite ordinary. Generally speaking the Marriotts are a cut below the other chains in Toronto (Sheraton, Hyatt, Delta, etc) and I can't think of a good reason other than price to return. Review #59:I recently stayed at this downtown Toronto hotel and loved my experience! The staff were friendly and helpful and the guest room was very comfortable. I have to say I am a big Marriott fan, the beds are so comfortable that I am considering buying one for my home. Review #60:I've just stayed at the Marriott on Bloor for business and found it to be a perfectly adequate hotel. The staff were very efficient and friendly, I used the valet on 3 days and found it very prompt and helpful, ate in the restaurant once and the service was excellent. My room was on the 4th floor, was a very spacious double and above all exceptionally clean. It was a bit of a walk from the elevators so elderly people would need to be sure to ask for somewhere relatively close to the these. Their high-speed internet was very good and probably the only downside was the fact that the shower wasn't adjustable and only provided a spray as opposed to a good old morning 'blast' to wake you up. All and all a very good business hotel and I would recommend to anyone. Review #61:This hotel had a four-star rating on Pricelin--the highest rating possible. So, I had high expectations, despite the Marriott brand... However, it was just a typical Marriott. Clean room, yes. Coffee maker, yes. TV, yes. Pleasant-enough staff, yes. That was about it. Some of the features advertised on Priceline as well as on hotel's own website/literature were not avaiable (e.g., no shuttle service to the airport, no gym/spa, etc.). All in all, this is a very good middle-class hotel. It certainly is NOT a four-star hotel by any means. Review #62:Stayed at the Marriott Bloor Yorkville on a business trip a few weeks ago and thought it was great. The rooms are the biggest I've ever stayed in - absolutely massive! Plus the bed - well I could've easily gotten 6 people in it lying side by side - absolutely huge. The hotel itself is situated in the upmarket district of Yorkville with a shopping centre and subway station right underneath. Location-wise it couldn't be better. Rooms were comfortable and clean, fresh linen and towels everyday. I particularly liked the black out curtains which helped my jetlag! The only time we ate in the restaurant was for breakfast and it was adequate enough - you don't expect amazing service or selection at that time of day. All in all, if I were to go back to Toronto on business or pleasure then I would definitely stay at this hotel. Review #63:This hotel was a great experience. I also stayed at another property in Toronto on the same trip that was supposed to be better, but it wasn't. I thought the service was very particular and I can appreciate that. This hotel is also in a very trendy part of town away from most of the hussle and bustle. I would suggest you stay at this hotel and I will try to stay here anytime I am in Toronto! Review #64:Typical 4 star Marriott. Nice room with an supremely comfortable bed. Helpful staff and nice breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Best feature of this hotel by far is the very easy access by car to the hotel. Once parked, the subway system is within a block. Nothing special about the room rates, however it is a good recommend for people driving into city whom need a good downtown base to work out of. Review #65:I recently stayed at this hotel for a conference and found the staff to be super-courteous, efficient, and helpful, and the location can't be beat: walking distance to most downtown locations and steps from the subway to go further afield. The rooms were very clean and well-appointed. My room was very large - though others in my group told me theirs were much smaller. Small quibbles about the room: despite the fact that there was lots of wall space, the only mirror was the one in the bathroom, and the bathroom had a shower only (fine for me, but something others might not like). The food served in connection with the conference was excellent (I didn't eat in the restaurant). Review #66:The hotel is in a great location, close to many wonderful restaurants, very charming neighborhood. The room was very spacious, the bed was comfortable and the service was excellent. I was able to find parking right across the street (not inexpensive but very close). Review #67:I recently stayed one night at the Marriott on Bloor. I booked through Priceline and got a good deal for a spectacularly located hotel. The valet was fantastic as was the staff checking in. The entire process was smooth and easy. When I arrived in the room it was clean but seemed a little dated, which was no big deal. I did find a very unappealing hair in the sink but that is an easy thing for a cleaner to miss. The stay was completely uneventful until I woke up the next morning to find a row of what appeared to be mosquito bites on my forehead. They were very itchy and took almost two weeks to disappear. When I had them checked I was advised they were bed bug bites. My initial inclination was to say nothing but was compelled to contact the hotel by a friend. To that end, I sent an e-mail to Marriott and received a response advising that my complaint would be forwarded to the hotel manager who would contact me. A week later and I still haven't had any response. To think that the manager of a large and very well know hotel would ignore a customer who had experienced beg bug bites is amazing. Every time I think of that night I am inclined to itch\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..sorry I had to stop typing to scratch. Review #68:Stayed here from Thursday 07-04-08 to Monday 07-07-08. Hotel is a bit older and as others have said finding your way from the parking garage to the hotel lobby can be challenging at first. We parked in the self parking at it cost us $42 for about 4 days, which isn't to bad. Pros- Bed--bed was absouletly the best I've slept on in a long time. Bathrooms- Bathrooms were newly remodeled and quite attractive. My fiance loved the look. Location- We rode the TTC 95% of the time. Didn't have to deal with parking or traffic and with the subway station being right under the hotel with access directly to the North/South Yonge and East/West Bloor lines, getting where we wanted to go couldn't have been easier. Cons- Courtyard- The room we stayed in was on the first floor and right on the ground level of the courtyard. Not a real big deal, but doesn't encourage you to open up the shades and you really need to make sure they are closed unless you want to expose your self to others. Fitness Centre-Fitness centre was closed for remodeling. Was looking forward to keeping up on my workout regiment and enjoying hte sauna. Lack of Pool- Really wish they had a pool or hottub of some sort. Overall a good experience. Rooms were clean and tidy and staff was pleasant. When weighing it against th $60/night we paid on priceline I couldn't really complain. Review #69:The staff were very friendly, and consistently so. They were always around to help. The rooms were a good size, and the bed was so comfortable. I slept really well. The bathroom was also fantastic! There were great shelves, so it gave me lots of room to spread out my toiletries and makeup. I was hoping for a good view, but I had an inner courtyard room on a low floor. Probably because I got a corporate reduced rate. The room was still nice, but if you are going here on vacation, it would be a bummer. Make sure you get a higher floor room. It was very conveniently located- it is connected to an underground passage with access to the subway and stores. I was able to go get Starbucks without even going outside, which was wonderful in February! PS- sorry ab the photo quality- took them with my crappy camera phone. Review #70:First of all, I'm a loyal Marriott customer because their rewards program is the best. While this wasn't the nicest Marriott property I've ever been to, the staff here was phenomenal. Everyone we encountered from the front desk, housekeeping, waiters, were the friendliest, most hard-working I've seen in quite a while. It's amazing to be at a large chain and yet feel that you're at a small, boutique hotel property. Stay here if you want personal, caring service! Review #71:We stayed here one night on 24 flight layover. We got ther room for $65 taxes incl. through priceline. The room was huge. It had no tub only a shower but tother than was very large with a King size bed, safe, in room coffee and large flat screen tv. Only downside is even thou I am a Marriots rewards person I could not get free internet in the room because i booked on priceline. Staff was exceptional. On departing I thought I had misplaced my passport. Not a good thing when the car they ordered is waiting and you need to catch an overseas flight. They helped keep me calm and three people helped me look. We found it where it should have been but their patience and calm was greatly appreciated. I do not know his name but the bellman was excellent not just in this instance but on each interaction. At regular price this hotel is very good and if you get a room through priceline it is a steal! Review #72:Stayed one night - ok, but missed not having a pool and hotub. booked on Priceline for $55US Parking - Before I arrived i called the hotel to ask about parking - they told me the only paking available is Valet for $27 a day. They did not tell me there is a parking garage which can be accessed underground right next to the hotel. I was surprized it only cost me $10 for a 24 hour period. It is a little confusing to find your way but there is a door from the underground shopping area to the hotel. We toured around using the subway system - worked out good only $9.00 for a day pass for 2 people Review #73:Stayed here for a \"business retreat\" with 3 days of intensive meetings in the Executive Boardroom. The location of my room was not so great (511) which was right beside the vending/ice machines. The buzz from the machines were a little annoying when trying to sleep and the view did not allow much for natural light. Luckily the days were spent at the meetings. The room itself was nice and clean, so no complaints. The water pressure for the shower could have been better. Local calls made from your room were at a charge of $1.50 and internet at around $16.00 a day I believe. The gym was well equipped and clean. Hotel staff is helpful and friendly. The location was great since the Bloor Station subway stop was right next door, so it was convenient getting around to shop etc. Bloor Street shops just down the street as well. Longo's grocery store with a Starbucks in it was also really convenient and open till 10pm in case you wanted some late night snacks or just to pop over to grab lunch or dinner at their salad/deli bar. Review #74:the Marriott Bloor st. Yorkville was located right in the center of shopping. The subway was available out the door and down a few steps. An indoor /underground mall, food court, post office & ATM machine were also right there-very convenient. The hotel staff was exceptionally pleasant and helpful. the bartender was a great source of information to 4 sisters getting together for a weekend on restaurants we might like, night clubs,and misc.the rooms were so verycomfortable w/ high beds w/ down comforters and big pillows, there is nightly turn down service as well. We had breakfast at the hotel on sunday morning, the food was delicious and served hot. there also was a breakfast buffet. The bar was nice and relaxing- a good place to regroup and make plans for the evening w/pleasant bartenders who did not mind taking our group picture for us.the hotel was clean and bright. Ask for a room close to the elevator for two of us had a very long walk down the very long hall to get to the room.I would stay here again if i come back to toronto. Review #75:I have stayed at this hotel at least once a year, probably twice a year for the past 4 years. I noted on a recent trip that they had done some changes to the furniture in the room which was nice. I find the staff to be very good, many have been at the hotel a long time, and if you get to know them are really friendly. The hotel is in the right location for being right on the subway and near Yorkville. I have had excellent success in the past with suggestions from the concierge for restaurants. I wish the Regular Marriotts and JW's would just give free internet access to all rooms, like most of the lower brands. This is more of a complaint in regards to the branding and whats included. Charging $13.95 for internet is ridiculous, although at least this one included free access in their business services area. The last trip included the breakfast buffet which was a bonus. The service there was really good. I have been upgraded for access to the concierge lounge which can be nice for a drink in the evening/snack or for breakfast. A lot better and more reasonably priced than other hotels in the area. Review #76:I stayed for a couple of days at this hotel on business. The room was comfortable and clean, though nothing special. I think the location was very central, though the office I was traveling to was rather far out. The hotel restaurant was very friendly, though the menu and decor are a bit uninspired or dated. The service was great, and I felt very welcomed by the staff. Review #77:We usually stay at 4 star hotels near Queen/University avenue to be close to the Four Seasons Centre but on this occasion our Hotwire booking led us to the Marriott in Yorkville. What a great experience! Lovely large room with very comfortable king bed overlooking a nice garden. Right above underground shopping mall with access to the Bay and Holt Renfrew and right above the subway. (and so it only took about 15 minutes to get to the Four Seasons Centre). Very convenient - and an added bonus is the LCBO right underneath the hotel where you can get a nice bottle of wine. Short walking distance to very good Yorkville restaurants and to Pusateri's (high end deli). We really enjoy a quiet room and were getting fed up with revellers returning to their rooms around 3 a.m. which happens quite often with hotels near the entertainment district. This hotel was much quieter. Strongly recommended. There is a problem with the trip advisor site - this hotel did not have a swimming pool but I cannot show that in the review...please disregard the rating for the pool...there isn't one! Review #78:Got this hotel via a priceline Bid and paid a really low price. We stayed for one night on a sunday night. The location is excellent, right on top of the subway. As others have mentioned, the room was pretty good without being awesome. No flat screen TV. We had a good view. Internet access is not free in the room, but you can go down to the business center and hook up your laptop, or use one of the many computers, even print out documents for free. In fact, they allow free photocopies (for the first 50 copies I think). Where this hotel excelled is in service. When we checked in, they noticed my infant daughter and immediately offered to send a crib and refrigerator to the room. When we got back home, I realized that my cell phone charger was back in the hotel. Called up the marriott, they actually have a lost-and-found department, and they mailed it to me quick and free. Review #79:Hotel was in great area. Metro in basement, nice market next door and across the street from a good all-day breakfast place. Seemed extremely safe to walk around. Very close to high end shopping and good restaurants. Ate one \"appetizer\" meal in restaurant. Good, not great. \"Jenny' the concierge was extremely helpful -- even walking us out the door to give us directions. Review #80:Being frequent visitors to Toronto, we have stayed here many times. Initially it had a \"boutique hotel\" atmosphere, but there has been a noticeable decline in quality & maintenance. Condition of the furniture varies amongst rooms from good to poor, and often the bathtubs/showers drain very slowly, so I have been showering ankle deep in water. The lobby requires refreshing, and corners of area rugs sometimes are curled up, creating a safety hazard. The Matisse restaurant was reconfigured and the original attractive trompe- l'oeil decor was not replicated. Thus one side now is just a long boring wall. It is conveniently located to the quality shopping of Bloor/Yorkville and the subway. The long time staff is very courteous, but my general impression of this hotel is that is has deteriorated. Rates can be higher than this hotel warrants, perhaps because of its proximity to the Four Seasons & Park Hyatt. The Marriott Eaton Centre is far superior to the Marriott Bloor/Yorkville. Review #81:i'm staying for this hotel for a business trip, and just now, the fire system alarmed. so i call the customer service if we will go out. she said no, and wait for the announcement. then the security personnel said that the fire alarm system was on and now under investigation, but the fire alarm was still on. so, i call again the customer service and ask if that was a fire drill, and she said with an angry voice (she is not shouting but you can feel that she was irritated) \"didn't you hear the announcement? what does it said?\" i just said to her that i did not hear anything what we should do. then she just said that i should stay on my room. i understand that she feel irritated maybe because a lot of people is calling them and asking them what to do, but still, I am the customer, and i only want my safety. she should still answer me in a good manner and assuring me that everything is under control and not to worry. how rude this people can be!! ! Review #82:The front desk was continually incompetent, through the full five days, from check in to check out. They confused the reservation, they confused the kind of room, they had never seen Marriott rewards members before, it seemed. It took me more time to check in and be finished with them and finally have my room to settle into, than it did to fly there. The attitude was always: prepare for disappointment. Many of them used the same phrase: \"I'll tell you what I can and cannot do\": to the most standard request: such as: here is my guaranteed reservation. I have stayed hundreds of nights at Marriotts and this was the worst front desk service I have ever encountered. Actually, I had to stand in line behind other customers who were having similar problems with the front desk. The staff could be heard discussing the customers, it seems they did not like the customers' attitudes. Even when some managers tried to address problems, the solutions were lost by the next shift and everything had to start from zero; or again there would be someone new who couldn't work the solution and would start back off again with: \"Let me tell you what I can and cannot do\". The TV did not work and it took several hours to fix. The concierge level offered minimal breakfast selections, and did not have \"snacks all day\". Very limited offerings. The elevators were extremely slow, many people waiting for them, and after five minutes waiting for the elevator, people would start to chat, all with the same concerns: the extremely cold rooms, the very poor and intermittent internet service. The only plus side: the room cleaning service and room service personnel were friendly, efficient, very good at their jobs. All the problems relate to management and the front desk. Location was superb, but so is the location of many downtown hotels. Review #83:I traveled to Toronto with my boyfriend for my 30th birthday. I have zero complaints. It was close enough to the airport, the taxi ride was 60 bucks. Its very close to the subway, lots of restaurants and shopping. I enjoyed taking like a 8 dollar cab ride to the eaton center, which is like this awesome shopping and eating destination. I has some really awesome food while in Toronto, one of the best things I had I found right outside the hotel. There is a food cart right on the corner it it sells the best polish sausage ever! Im from chicago where hot dogs and sausage are big. So when I say it was sooo good, I mean it. The Marriot on Bloor had very nice employees they were helpful, when needed. My room was amazing! It was huge, clean ,comfortable, the complimentary robes were great. I would without a question stay here again. Review #84:The Toronto Marriott Bloor Yorkville is definitely in a very good location within Toronto. In the heart of the city and close to many of what Toronto offers. Getting to the hotel can be challenging at the wrong time of day due to horrible traffic near the airport. The hotel seems to have been renovated recently and the rooms reflect the newest Marriott standards. Room was clean and the latest technology was installed (i.e. Flat Screen TV). The bathroom was clean and updated. When I arrived at the hotel about 3 pm, there were no rooms available, so I had to go to the business center and did some work while I waited for a hotel to be ready. They gave me a nice end room which was far away from the elevator and was in a quiet section of the hotel. One thing that was disappointing is that the hotel did not contain a swimming pool. This was a surprise for a Marriott and considering its location and its hotel class. Although my stay was pleasant and trouble free, I will most likely not come to this hotel again. Review #85:Stayed in a large room wtih two double beds. Hotels staff was friendly and rooms were very clean. The location is ideal for shopping and Restaurants on Cumberland Street are very good, pricey but well worth it. The only inconveniene is the parking. Situated in another complex and to access it you need to exit the property. Review #86:I stayed at the Marriott, Bloor for 3 nights on business. From the moment I walked into the property I was impressed. The front desk clerk took the time to answer my questions and helped me map out my excursions for the next day. She was extremely patient with me and very knowledgeable about Toronto. She surprised me because I saw her in the lobby two days after I checked in and she referred to me by name! The hotel has been recently renovated so the rooms are extremely nice and a bit larger than the typical hotel room. The bathroom was tastefully done and the bed was very comfortable. The location can't be beat. It's located at the intersection of two subway lines plus is right near Yonge Street so you can go for a stroll any time of the day and night and feel safe. I would definately stay here again if I return to Toronto. Review #87:My husband and I recently stayed at the Toronto Marriott at Bloor. There's nothing wrong with this hotel (it's perfectly fine), but there's nothing particularly special about it either. We booked through Hotwire and got a great deal, so we have nothing to complain about. However, we noted the hotel is a little worse for wear in spots (the room doors look old, and the paint was badly chipped on the closet door in our room). There's no pool or spa -- I sort of expect a pool for a four star hotel. It's nicely decorated, and the staff were helpful (even moving us to the top floor on check-in). The walls might be a little thin (our neighbours woke us up in the early morning). I'd probably give it a 3.5 star rating overall. The location is good if you want to be conveniently located to Yorkville. I wouldn't discourage someone from staying here, but I also think there a lot more interesting and/or nicer places to stay in Toronto. Review #88:I was travelling with a delegation of 8 from India and we stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel that you spend through your jet lag usually doesnt get good reviews but this was a good place. Rooms were decent ( though I did find lighting a bit low) bathrooms decent sized and comfortable beds. I had a few vegetarians in my group and we checked in by 8 pm on arrival. Check in process was smooth and everyone had their room keys in less than 5 minutes which was impressive. The restaurant was closed by the time we all freshened up and came down, so we ended up having to order dinner at the bar. The waiter was really kind and managed a group of 10 walking in near to closing time very well including a few with dietary restrictions. Review #89:I travelled to Toronto on Jan 20/12 to spend a weekend with my 3 sisters and cousin for a fun girls weekend. We were very happy with the location of the hotel, close to shopping (underground) with wonderful restaurants nearby. We received an upgraded room that included a sitting area that was perfect for our group. All calls to the concierge and for room service were handled immediately and we always had service with a smile. I would defintely return to this hotel for a future stay in Toronto and have no complaints about the hotel whatsover. Review #90:I stayed at the Toronto Marriott Bloor Yorkville for two nights in mid-February. It was OK, for a four star hotel. I stay in Toronto a number of nights per year on business... and this hotel is at best OK. It's on the PATH (underground walkway/shopping) but that is the highlight. The rooms are clean and well kept... but the hotel is on the smaller side, and you can do better for the same price in Toronto (eg the Sheraton Centre). The staff was friendly, but there is nothing here to bring me back. Review #91:My family of 3 stayed here on Labor Day weekend in Toronto. It was very nice. Clean, updated, and worth far more than the $50/nt a paid through Priceline. It was very convenient taking the subway to see LOTR, Medieval times, and CN tower, from the hotel. We ate breakfast at Matisse restaurant one morning. It was very good, but expensive. We used the business center to check emails. That was very convenient also. The only complaint we had was the long walk to the room when we got off the elevator. We were in room 138. We would definitely stay here again, but will ask for a room close to the elevator. The only reason I didn't rate this hotel excellent, is the lack of a pool. Review #92:Great service, nice restaurant, good location. Excellent all around. Especially good was the man with the mustache at the concierge/trip planning desk who was absolutely the most helpful hotel staff person I have ever met anywhere. He went above and beyond in helping us plan our activities etc. These are the things that stay with you after visiting a new city. The whole atmosphere at the hotel is positive. Room service was prompt and delicious. Review #93:we actually stayed here on a comp through marriott rewards. Staff was excellent! We stayed in room 631 view of courtyard, well appointed room . 42\" TV , nicely decorated room, refrigerator, nice bathroom too. I believe it was recently renovated. Garage was $26.55/day with in & out privaleges... WELL WORTH IT! We stayed over on thursday nite checked in at noon and left at 9am. Staff was very friendly, turn down service at nite was nice. This place is alot nicer than the Courtyard Marriott on Yonge St. (Stayed theire 3 times) The only thing missing was a swimming pool. There is a nice concierge lounge on 6th floor that provides breakfast in morning and snacks all day long! If the price is right I'd go back in a heart beat! Review #94:We stayed here before flying out to Montreal and after we had already stayed in a noisy condo on the outer city limits. So we were looking for a bit of pampering and the suite with separate bedroom did not disappoint. Peaceful, comfortable bed was excellent. The proximity to upmarket shopping and plenty of restaurants in nearby Yorkville makes this a good place to stay. Also particularly handy is the AVIS rental garage in the same building. Front desk staff on checkin were very helpful finding us the right room. Only worrying thing is what seems to be an epidemic in Many North American hotels...most are \"pet friendly\". It's hard to stop yourself wondering what kind of animal has been in the room before you! Especially when you hear the occasional \"yap yap\" from the room across the hall. Review #95:Stayed at the Marriott Bloor Yorkville while attending a conference. Check in process was quick and easy. Front desk staff was helpful. The rooms were large and very clean. The bed was great, although the room was noisy. It was as if there was a mechanical/boiler/laundry room on the other side of the wall by the head of the bed. The sound of the fans and thumping could be heard all night. Requested a late check out, but it was not available due as the hotel was booked to capacity. Overall, good experience, would stay again. 20minute walk to Eaton Centre. The self parking at the hotel is difficult to find as it has poor signage. Review #96:Stayed at the Marriott Bloor Yorkville this past weekend with my boyfriend. The hotel was a nice walk away from Yorkville and all the great shopping and restuarants. The staff and the property itself was very clean and modern, especially our room. Our room was luxurious with a beautiful bathroom and fine furnishings. The bed was so comftorable that when I returned home to my own bed I went out matress shopping the next day!!! We ordered room service breakfast both mornings we were there since there wasnt any other good breakfast places in the area except for Mickey Ds and Tim Hortons. A little pricey ($15 a person) yet they deliver it to your room and the portions were larger then normal. Very delicious. Highly recommend this property! Review #97:This hotel is directly over the subway giving it easy access to pretty much anywhere you would want to go in the city. The front desk was helpful and the workers were all friendly. Those that gave the hotel bad reviews based on the walking distance to the room should be ashamed of their laziness. I had a long discussion with the parking attendant related to the parking fees. As I was leaving I noticed that you can get the ticket validated by the hotel but when I expressed that to the attendant she told me not to do it. I guess if you get the parking ticket validated you get one free night of parking allowing you to leave and come back in but each additional day is $26 or $28 dollars. If you park the car and dont leave the structure for 3 nights or more the rate for parking without the ticket getting validated is only $16. So if you are staying for more than 2 nights and dont need to drive anywhere it is cheaper to not have your ticket validated. Review #98:We had been invited to a retirement party in Toronto and decided to make it a get away weekend. The hotel had been selected for it's affordability, proximity to the party and the underground access to the subway. Also very close to some good shopping. We booked the hotel directly by phone and our room rate was $ 149.00 per night, which included a breakfast for two each morning. The breakfast was excellent; lots of fresh fruit, eggs, meats, breads, cereals, yogurt, warm oatmeal etc. On Sunday morning we were able to order custom eggs/omelettes. It may have been available on Saturday morning as well, but we didn't know. Very friendly wait staff, as was all the other staff at the hotel. We used valet parking which is extra. If you are on a budget you could park your car on the very end destinations of the Toronto Transit system and take it to this hotel. Puchase a day pass for $ 9.00 which is valid for 2 adults or 2 adults with up to 4 kids 19 and under or 1 adult with 5 kids 19 and under. What a deal. Go to many attractions/shopping in minutes and no parking hassles and fees. Very easy to learn and any Torontonians we asked for directions were very helpfull. Some even walked us to were we needed to go. The room at the hotel was clean and cheery, the bed was excellent. The toiletries of spa quality. Everything was to our satisfaction. Our dinner at the hotel restaurant was also very good. Lunch was enjoyed elswhere. A magazine in the room called WHERE has lots of good information in respect to attractions, shopping, dining and transportation. The Royal Ontario Museum has some nice exhibitions at te moment and Friday night tickets are half price. ps Don't forget to tip the wait staff at breakfast because when you have a voucher they do not present you with a bill. We will definitely stay here again. Review #99:Over the course of the last 7 months, I spent 29+ weeks in residence at the Toronto Marriott Bloor Yorkville Hotel. I can say without hesitation that it is the best service that I have received while staying in a hotel across the globe. The accomodations are wonderful, but the staff are superb. Starting with the front desk, you will be greeted by friendly, caring staff who will make every effort to ensure your accomodations are perfect. They are more than helpful in recommending restaurants, shopping, as well as any activities that you might wish to enjoy. The front desk is up-to-date on events occurring within the city, both current and upcoming. Please give Tamara, Sergio, Carol and all of the other staff my warm regards when you stay. For those who have access to the Concierge Lounge, you MUST meet George. He is one of the crown jewels of this hotel. George oversees the lounge in the evenings and maintains a clean, friendly environment with delicious appetizers (actually, you could make a meal off the appetizers). He was quick to enquire about my day, and then truly listened when it was \"one of those days\". The Bell Captain and staff are also fantastic. Victor will double-check to make certain that all of your luggage arrives safely from your mode of transportation to the lobby, as well as when you leave back safely into your taxi/limo. All of the staff are courteous, professional, and provide that \"at home\" feeling. I would strongly recommend this hotel and when I next travel to Toronto, this will be the hotel of my choice.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

With so many hotels as options, you do not need to subject yourself to our experience. On our last night at the hotel (we stayed 10 nights) we were packing our belongings when I discovered that my jewelry had been stolen from our suitcase. There are no hotel safes, nor are there safes in the rooms. In my naivete, I assumed there would be a safe so I did not check when we confirmed our booking. Without a safe, we decided to do the next best thing and hide our jewelry in one suitcase that was rolled up and put into another suircase, which was then stuffed under the armoire! The thief, apparently a professional, was so adept at picking the real from the fake, that only costume jewelry remained. Overall, close to $12,000 in jewelry was stolen. We called the police, and they conducted an \"investigation\". Clearly, the jewelry would never be found. The hotel manager and owner, Mr. Alain Bigeard, was not helpful, and has washed his hands clean of this unfortunate event. With so few employees in the hotel (there are a total of 6 employees including the owner) it is quite disappointing to have experienced such a tragedy. Review #1:I booked the hotel on the advice of this website and guidebooks for the first 3 nights of our honeymoon and it lived upto expectations. It is in a beautiful location very central which meant we walked nearly everywhere and the surrounding area 'Marais' provided us with enough restaurants, cafes and atmosphere to keep us entertained for the 3 nights of our stay. The Hotel could not have been more accomodating, we had a room on the 6th floor with a balcony on the front looking out over the rooftops of Paris. The rooms are compact and Bijou but they had everything we could have needed, the breckfast was excellent value and served till 12pm and the staff always polite. It is not a huge place and does not have a restaurant or leisure facilities in house but your in central paris and you do not need an excuse to go and look for somewhere to eat or walk. The Hotel Caron De Beaumarchais is an affordable and beautiful place to stay in a beautiful and expensive city. Review #2:About 3 years ago while wandering around Le Marais, I passed by Caron de Beaumarchais and fell in love with it's charm. I took a photo that I posted on Flickr and tagged so I could remember the name of this hotel when I returned. Unfortunately, 10 months later when I returned, there was no vacancy. :( This year, after being away from Paris for too long, I had the chance to return and sent an email to the hotel to see about availability. Sure enough it was! Of course, all of the anticipation really raised my expectations. But Caron de Beaumarchais didn't disappoint. It was as charming on the inside as the outside. The hotel gave me the rooftop floor with the balcony - something I couldn't really use as it was rainy in Paris while I was there, but adored nonetheless. The room, as are all Paris rooms, was tiny, but charming. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. The location couldn't be beat. The room was clean. The view was amazing. And I got a kick out of watching others stop and stare at the beautiful front of the hotel when I was waiting in the lobby area. The price was incredible for such a great location. I'd recommend this hotel highly. I can't wait to return! Review #3:The hotel lived up to expectations in every way. It was also a good test of Tripadvisor.com as it was the first time I'd based my hotel choice on the reviews on here. We stayed on the second floor - room 20 - and it was beautiful. Yes the room wasn't big but we were staying 12 days and had no problem storing all our clothes. And managed to stow the empty suitcases right out of the was behind the little writing desk. Unless you have a massive appetite you really do only need one breakfast and share it. We didn't even order extra coffee as what comes with breakfast gave us 3 cups - more than enough unless you want to spend the morning looking for a toilette!! The coffee was good strong french coffee not rather weak hotel coffee which so many places serve. We always had breakfast in the little breakfast room as I do actually like to get up and out of the room for breakfast. I was a little worried as the Hotel advertises \"Herald Tribune\" with breakfast that it catered exclusively for Americans. But if you're English don't worry there's also the option of the Guardian and Figaro available in the braekfast room. The fresh flowers in the room, the bathrobes, the lovely soaps and bath toiletries all make for a special stay. We ate mainly at Les Philosophes restauant about 2 minutes walk up the road and had lovely meals and excellent service. The hotel is a perfect base for Paris, we did use the Metro for the further flung destinations. but so much is walkable - buy a good map and get out there! A word of advice get to the big attractions early - we breakfasted at 8 and were at Notre Dame, the Eifel Tower, the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay etc by around 9.30 and beat the worst of the queues. A perfect stay and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a peaceful break in Paris. Don't worry if your French is rusty - the front desk staff speak excellent English and are very friendly. Review #4:Absolutely incredible. I booked this hotel based on their website and the reviews on this and other websites. I corresponded with the staff at the Caron de Beaumarchais and booked the room with the best view of Notre Dame because I wanted to propose to my girlfriend from the terrace. They were very accomodating and helpful. They helped me make reservations at restaurants and provided glasses and corkscrews for the wine we brought back to the room. Oh, by the way, SHE SAID YES!!! Merci! Review #5:Staying in this property is not for those who seek luxury at each turn. The good things are the location and convenience - you can literally walk Paris from the front door. The bad are that the rooms are small (worth asking for a balcony room when booking) and it's a couple of hundred years old ( - is that good or bad?). We quite happily lived in this hotel (in the fifth floor balcony room) for a week and thought it was a great option. Review #6:We found the location was excellent but the rooms are really really small. Bathrooms are tiny and can't fit two people. Still the place has a real sense of history, helpful front desk staff and one of the better locations in Paris. Felt safe walking around the neighbourhood . The price is quite reasonable and you feel like you are in Paris as opposed to staying in a standard Hilton.I wouldn't stay again even though I was happy as I think there is better value to be had. Review #7:My daugher and I stayed here from June 13-18th and were very pleased with the hotel and its location. The decor was quaint, the rooms small (we expected that), beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning worked! The staff was helpful, especially the gentleman who was at the desk the morning we left. He made an extraordinary(and successful) effort to get us a taxi on a Monday morning at rush hour. We enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the hotel's location in the Marais. There were numerous cafes, shops and restaurants to choose from within a couple blocks radius. We were able to walk to Notre Dame and several other sights and there were two metro stations close by when we didn't feel like walking. The area reminded me of the Trastavere area of Rome where you don't feel like you are in the midst of the tourist crowds at the end of a day of sightseeing. Review #8:I have stayed at this hotel both times I visited Paris, and if I get the opportunity to return, I would stay there again. Though the rooms are petit, the staff is friendly and very helpful. They treated my husband and myself very respectfully, in spite of our youthful appearance. The decor is charming throughout, the breakfast is decadent, and there is free wireless internet. The hotel is situated right off the Rue de Rivoli, so it is in walking distance from the Louvre, as well as the french department store, BHV. I recommend this hotel for romantics and 17th century history lovers because of the ambiance that evokes the romance of the past. Review #9:I have been to Paris many times and prefers to stay near the Rue de Rivoli as that is close to everything and easy to get around by the metro. This hotel is very central, right between two metro stations (H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville and St. Paul). The hotel is very typical Parisian, with very small rooms, small elevator and steep stairs. But the rooms were very clean (we had two rooms). My mother and my aunt shared a room with twin beds. It was two beds, but they were so close together that you might as well call it a double bed. There was no room to move the bed further apart, but they didn't mind. I shared a double bed with my young daugher and even if the bed was quite small, it was comfortable. The hotel is decorated in the style of the 17th century and is very charming if you like that type of decor. Even though the hotel is a step away from the busy Rue de Rivoli, we heard no trafic or other noise from our room. The breakfast room was tiny, but the breakfast was very good and it was more than enough to eat. The staff is very friendly and even though I spoke French with them, I could hear them speaking very well English with other guests. They were very helpful and serviceminded. I would stay here again! Review #10:I have to say that of all the hotels I have stayed in Paris, this one is by far my favorite. The service is wonderful, the staff is incredibly helpful, the rooms are perfectly delightful - I stayed in a front facing room with a balcony. The windows are double glazed, so while it is on a busy street, noise was not a problem. The location was fantastic - the Marais is pefectly situated for shopping, eating and strolling. Free Wi-Fi is very convenient......just a few doors down there is a takeaway coffee shop which can be a rarity in Paris (Cafe Columbus), perfect for a morning croissant and coffee that you can take back to your room. Best of all, check out the chandeliers in each room and the amazing lightbulbs, they are on rockers and gently sway making it look like real candles! Review #11:I had read many positive reviews of this site so decided to book here for my most recent trip to Paris. I was enchanted by their web site (which can be deceiving but not in this case). The room on tfifth floor streetside was compact but sunny with a tiny balcony with table and chairs. This is Paris so the room was tiny, but well-designed with two built-in armoires for storage. The setting was charming and exactly what I had been looking for from the antiques to the decor to the fresh flowers I was pleased to see there was a full bath with tub I have stayed in other 3-stars in Paris where all you get is a teensy shower stall. Yes, there was no shower curtain, but you can adjust the handheld shower spray so that it doesn't make a mess. The English-speaking staff was very nice and helped with dinner reservations. It is in a great location in the Marais district. The only downside of the location is that the neighborhood can get a little noisy at night especially if you leave the french doors cracked open. Overall this is about as good as it gets for this price in Paris. The little extras (flowers, candy, linens, atmosphere, nice bath products) really kick it up a notch above the rest in this category. Review #12:We have just come back from a 5 night stay at the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais. A superb location with immediate access to the hip and happening Marsais. The staff is friendly, the rooms although small (petite) are newly restored and charming with distinct character touches, and clean modern bathrooms. Balcony rooms (top 2 floors) offer excellent rooftop views and sunsets overlooking Notre Dame. Overall met all expectations of a small \"lost in time\" boutique hotel bording the hippest neighborhood with excellent shopping, eating and down right best people watching spot in town. Review #13:We stayed at the Caron de Beaumarchais at Christmastime this year. We has stayed there about 6 years prior, and had lovely memories. Not this time. Our room was tiny (I know, it's a Parisian hotel) dark, overlooked the noisy Rue de Rivoli, had a bathroom the size of a closet, with almost no actual closet space in the room. When we asked about changing rooms, the gentleman at the desk told us ALL the rooms were this small. (Maybe we were younger then, and more easily enchanted...) And to top it off, the minibar was in the bathroom- ewww. Ended up paying for 2 nights and only stayed 1.Thankfully found a great room for the rest of the trip at the Hotel Duo, also in the Marais. Will stay there again on our next trip to Paris! Review #14:Aside from the location, I hated this place. The Marais is an amazing neighborhood, but not worth a stay in this dirty little hotel. The carpets were worn and torn, and i was afraid to take my shoes off. Moreover, the maid's hair was on my sheets, and i seriously doubted the integrity and cleanliness of the mattresses and sheets. I was just here for one night, but I didn't get any sleep at all - I was too afraid the bed bugs would bite. This hotel is cheap, but you'd be better off moving to a less amazing location in order to preserve your sanity. I would recommend the Hotel Elysees Regencia in the 16e on Avenue Marceau. The rooms are slightly more expensive, but you get a whole lot more for the money. Review #15:We stayed here for five nights in October/November. It was a wonderful location. Our room was very charming, it had all the nice touches and the bathroom was clean and modern. We were very happy staying here and felt we got a lot of for the money, considering we were staying in Paris! Review #16:This was a wonderful 5 days in a charming 3 star hotel in a perfect location. The service was extremely helpful - making bus reservations to airport as we left the first day of the strike. Very charming though the lobby looked like it could use a dusting. Didn't pay for breakfast as there was a bakery and coffee shop up the block. Review #17:Based on good web & book reviews I booked this hotel expecting it to be an assured \"treat\" on a world trip. My experience of the hotel was very disappointing. Although I had requested a twin room, I was given a double (2 singles pushed together)in a room of \"shoe box\" proportions. This problem was obviously considered adequately rectified by reconfiguring a gap, the thickness of an envelope, between the beds. The lovely courtyard I'd expected to face onto was no more than a light well running up the centre of the building, glimpsed from my 3rd floor room. (I'd imagined a room on the courtyard would have lovely French doors for me to access it). I will certainly return to Paris and to the same district but I shall stay in a hotel capable of delivering on promise and service and not one hidden behind the folly of novelty. Review #18:My wife and I stayed here for two nights and had a great stay. The staff was pleasant, the location perfect and the style/ambiance of the rooms was great. Granted, the rooms are not particularly big by any standard but they are cozy and comfortable. We got a room facing the street which has a good view. I think if would have gotten a room with no view or a courtyard view the rooms would have felt too small. We got the breakfast package and had a beautiful spread delivered to our room - incredible pastries, soft boiled eggs, fruit and a pot of stellar, strong coffee. It doesn't sound particularly amazing but whenever we talk about our favorite breakfasts of all time, this one always comes up. Its a great way to start a daily adventure in Paris. Next time we are in Paris we plan to stay here. Can't go wrong. Review #19:Sweet place to stay in the Marais area. We stayed here for 5 days at the end of June. The room & bathroom was very tiny, but very clean. Our room on the 2nd floor (would be the 3rd floor in the US) had a little balcony. Like many boutique hotels, there was only one person at the front desk...and a different one everyday. All the attendants were extremely pleasant and helpful with all our questions. Dry cleaner is next door if you need it. Plenty of restaurants and shops in the neighborhood. About 8 minute walk to Hotel D'Ville or St. Paul metro. Right off Rue Rivoli and close to Les Halles & The Louvre. We would definitely stay here again. Review #20:beautiful boutique hotel, great location and service only drawback is the cheaper rooms ( courtyard view) are small, and a bit dark. it is worth the extra 10 euros for the front facing windows. whiach are larger and brighter. would go back in an instant Review #21:I stayed there 4 years ago and enjoyed it even better this time. Great staff, great location and the new decor is just soooo cute! Rooms are a bit small but I think it's a good size for Paris anyway and the antics make you forget that the minute you enter your room. This is definitely \"mon maison a Paris\". Review #22:My 11 year old daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights and were really delighted with our choice. I don't think we could have got a better location in the beautiful Marais district with everything we needed nearby including lots of shopping and great restaurants. The hotel and the rooms are small but lovely with loads of towels in the bathroom and a mini bar. Breakfast was enormous with one enough for both of us to share. We had a street facing room on the first floor and were surprised at how quiet it was. I will be recommending it to family and friends. Review #23:My mum and I just returned from an 8 day stay in Paris and we stayed at the charming little boutique Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais. I did a lot of research before hand, as I was traveling with my 65 year Mum, and wanted her to have the comforts that not all European hotels have. This hotel met all of our expectations : ~The location can't be beat (5min saunter to the Seine, right in the heart of Paris. 5min walk to metro) ~ All the staff we met were delightfully helpful and pleasant (Phillip & Genevieve were great). They were patient when we used our French, and welcoming when speaking in our native English. ~We had a front side room with a balcony, although just off of Rue de Rivoli it was surprisingly quiet. ~ Not only was our room decorated with a \"Marie- Antoinette feeling\" with grand drapes and exposed ceiling beams; our twin beds were comfortable, we had ample closet space for our clothes, and our room was impeccably clean. It was, as others have stated, the regular small Parisian size. ~The breakfast was large, my mother and I shared one between us, delivered to our room each morning...croissant, pain au chocolat, baguette, butter & jams, egg, coffee, fruit, yogurt, and cheese. The flavours were wonderful! ~As well as the cafes and restaurants around every corner, there is a delicious boulangerie 4 doors down and a Mon-op grocery store around the corner. Truly we were delighted with our find here, and will be booking here again for sure. Paris is such and enchanting city, and staying at Caron de Beaumarchais just added to the over-all wonderful experience. Review #24:What a lovely Hotel. Our room was on the 5th floor, with a balcony. Small but had enough room for what we wanted. The location is perfect for anything you would want to do in Paris. Metro very close, and many sights within walking distance, which we preferred. The staff was wonderful, very helpful and attentive. We would definately stay here again! ! Review #25:Based on the ecstatic reviews on this site and Fodor's, we reserved a street-fronting room for mid-September several months in advance. My friend and I have stayed in mid-priced hotels in the Marais before, so we understand what to expect for the money in that area. What really sold us on the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais, along with the great reviews -- the prospect of a little balcony in the Marais. We received a confirmation for a street-fronting room, but days before we left for France, we received a new confirmation for a \"courtyard view.\" We thought it was too late to make new arrangements, and how bad could it be? The \"courtyard,\" it turns out, is an air shaft, and courtyard rooms are aparently much smaller than street-fronting rooms. I can only assume the people who love this hotel do not get courtyard rooms. Frankly, apart from the tinyness, it was truly dumpy and ordinary and I defy anyone to find the \"charm\" in that room. As noted by others, the bed is too short for someone 5'11\" tall. Around 2 am a very strong smell permeated the airshaft -- I guess some restaurant began cooking -- it smelled like meatloaf. We never did sleep that night. All in all it was a grim little cell we couldn't wait to leave, which we did as soon as we found another hotel. It is a little disorienting -- all these positive reviews and our experience was not like that at all. All I can say is, don't let them downgrade you to a \"courtyard\" room! Review #26:Typical, quaint French Hotel in the hip Marais area. Close to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville and Pompidou Center (Metro about 6 blocks). We stayed in a lovely room (#10) on the second floor with a faboulous view and large windows that opened up to the street. The breakfast was delightful: great croissants, bread, jam, butter, fresh OJ, coffee and hard boiled egg served in a tiny kitchenette (or in your room). Yes, the rooms were small, but decorated lovingly. The service was fabulous, English speaking and with an attendant always at the front desk (entrance) which was more like a small living room. We would return and recommend this hotel. For the price we felt this was a good value. Review #27:Just returned from 3 nights in Paris, great time to go in early spring!! It was our 4th stay in the city and we wanted to stay in Le Marais which is great for less touristy dining and drinking! The Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais was a perfect location. We had the 6th floor front room and although I agree that it was TINY, it was also very cute and clean. The best thing about the front rooms is the balcony where we had breakfast 2 mornings. We could have sat out there all morning in the sun! We paid 142 euros per night which was less than originally quoted. This is a small hotel so expect to have to wait occasionally for the staff to return to the front desk etc. Overall the staff were very friendly as mentioned by other reviewers. The only thing that was a little annoying was the very loud banging of the doors to the rooms next to us early in the mornings. This was the cleaning staff. It was only so noticable because the rooms are so close but I kept thinking it was our door was being unlocked. Overall a great stay in a very 'parisian' hotel. Review #28:Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais was such a find!! Our Parisian friends suggested we stay here and we are so happy we did! Each day we awoke to a beautiful room with wood beams and lovely French furniture. We could open our windows to a beautiful little balcony and enjoy feel of Paris. Room size was a bit small but no smaller than most in Paris. The concierge was quite welcoming but I think was happy to see us depart because we asked for hot water for tea each night when we came home around 7 or 8pm, we felt like we really put them out by asking for this but they put up with our outlandish demands! (lol) They were truly kind to us and gave us directions and recommendations at every turn. This hotel is extremely convenient to walk anywhere!! To Notre Dame and a short bus ride to the Louvre or Muse'e D'Orsay or even to the Eiffel Tour, the baus station is right around the corner from the hotel. I highly recommend taking the bus like a regular Parisian, who by the way, were incredibly helpful to these two Americans who could not speak proper French. The trick here is to \"attempt\" to speak some French; once they know you're trying, they're much more apt to help you. About the bus, take the bus rather than the metro, you'll experience Paris as it should be experienced, like a local! On the whole, Beaumarchais was a wonderful place to stay, cozy, convenient and courteous(for the most part!) Rooms on the small size, no American television but I didn't come to Paris to watch TV I came to see Paris and that I did from this wonderful location. Review #29:My friend and I recently returned from a week's stay at the Caron de Beaumarchais and really enjoyed our stay there. We chose the hotel for its location and superior reputation and had a twin room, facing the street. The hotel is decorated for its period and is, hence, quite visually busy. The room was small, but roomy enough for two women with lots of stuff, and contained everything one would need. On the other hand, it's full of period furniture, big drapery, a chandelier that one of us hit every time we reached overhead to put our arms through a sweater, etc. The proprietor takes pride in the period decor, but did install a shower curtain for us immediately when we expressed concern about soaking the curtainless bathroom twice/day. There's a lovely woman at the desk most days named Genevieve who spoke with us at length about anything and everything and was warm, accommodating, fun and genuine. We decided against the hotel breakfast (12 euros) even though they serve at the most humane hours....up until 12. We did, however, order coffee twice and weren't thrilled with it. We found the coffee at the boulangerie up the street to be superior and most days went there for breakfast at an extremely reasonable price. The hotel is, in my view, in the best location in Paris...two steps off the Rue de Rivoli, easy walking to the Bastille and neighborhoods beyond, and likewise to the Louvre, Ile de la Cite, left bank, etc. We even walked back from Montmartre. There are lots of cafes, restaurants and interesting shops surrounding the hotel. Most highly recommended is L'As du Falafel for its excellent schwarma and falafel for a price you can live with while the euro is eating you alive! Review #30:I stayed twice in this hotel, in January 2008 (with my husband) and in May 2011 (with my parents). The hotel is really cute and well decorated (the pictures in their website are very accurate). The room is small, yet really comfortable and quiet. The bed is excellent; the shower has good pressure and temperature. The location is amazing! The hotel's street is very beautiful and has a lot of bakeries, caf\u00c3\u00a9s, restaurants, bars and shops. It also has a very good fromagerie and a nice wine bar, which is also a book shop. The hotel is very close to the subway and several interesting places. But, above all, what makes this hotel special is its service. The owner and the staff are extremely kind, helpful and attentive, especially Philipp and Geneveuve. I hope I can travel to Paris many times and, each time, I hope to stay there. Review #31:I booked this hotel for a romantic 2 day break for my husband's birthday, and the hotel and location couldn't have been more perfect! We had a room on the 5th floor with a balcony, and yes, it was a little petit, but really lovely nonetheless. The bathroom was a good size wtih a good shower/bath. The service couldn't have been nicer, really great reception wtih perfect English, yet were patient to humour me with my terrible French, without laughing! The location is amazing - you are in the heart of the Marais, with great shops, art, bars, restaurants, coffee shops - all sorts. A lot of sights are walkable to and from the hotel, including Hotel de Ville, Notre Dame, Latin Quarter to name but a few. I would go back again and again.... Review #32:I was referred to this lovely, little hotel by two friends and after exhaustive research and reading of many other TripAdvisor reviews, I booked my reservation for three nights in September. The staff were nice and helpful. The room was perfectly charming and well-presented... perfect for a solo traveler like myself. While I didn't partake in the breakfast, there was an amazing (and highly-regarded) boulangerie a few doors down on Rue Vieille du Temple where I had amazing breads and pastries in the morning. 2.5 blocks off the Seine, yet close to the main street of Rue de Francs Bourgois in Le Marais, the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais was ideally and centrally located for all there is to see and do in Paris. I will definitely stay here when I return next year. Review #33:We spent four nights in this hotel during our honey moon last July and it was exactly what we expected - Great location, charming hotel. The Roget Gallet soaps was a nice touch. International papers with breakfast big enough for two people. Helpful staff (speak many languages fluently). Free High speed Internet, which was perfect to plan our days and nights. Rooms are small as you would expect in Paris. Review #34:The hotel staff was very nice and accomodating about my lack of French (they even gave a French friend directions to the hotel in French for me). I stayed in Room #1 (their cheapest), and while some have complained about it being too small, or overlooking the entrance, I enjoyed being able to walk in the door and enter my room in a few steps. It is small (by American hotel room standards), but perfectly suitable for one person. It was an amazing stay and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Review #35:Caron du Beaumarchais is certainly well-reviewed on this site and many others but I am not sure it deserves all the accolades. It is located very conveniently in the Marais -- only a few blocks from the Metro and lots of shops but right next to one of Paris' busiest and nosiest streets - rue de Rivoli. The windows keep out most of the noise, but if you are in the front as we were, it precludes you from opening the windows at night for fresh air when the AC isn't on yet as was the case during our recent 4 night stay when we were lucky enough to have beautiful 65-70F days and the hotel does not have fans. Most of the staff are friendly and the hotel was particularly helpful in making reservations in advance at L'Amboisie - a very tough to get **** restaurant in Place des Voges. One notable exception was the afternoon clerk who was consistently rude -- never returning customary greetings and barely acknowledging our presence each time we dropped off or retrieved the room key. He often waited several minutes while working at the computer before even looking up, knowing we were waiting. The rooms are indeed small as reported, but typical for European hotels. The decor is quaint and charming but appears a little worn around the edges despite having undergone a renovation last year. Beds are comfortable but seem unusually short and really can't accomodate anyone above 6'! The bathroom is clean but small; linens are fine but not luxurious. I still don't understand why the showers are w/o curtains or doors! It leaves such a mess! The rooms were cleaned promptly each morning. We did not have breakfast there as we typically like to go out and have our cafe and croissant in local boulangeries with the other Parisiens -- and there are plenty to pick from in the Marais. Overall, I expected more and was a bit disappointed. Experience was not bad, but would not rush back here as many others have recommended. Review #36:My wife and I stayed at the Caron de Beaumarchais hotel for 2 nights in May of 2006. We had read an article in a magazine about the hotel and wanted to see what it was like. We were very satisfied with the accomodations and virtually had no complaints. We had one of the more expensive rooms on the 2nd floor facing the street with a small balcony that had a table and 2 chairs. We were able to have a drink out on the balcony and people watch. The room was furnished with antiques and had a beautiful beamed ceiling and a chandelier. The bathroom was in good shape with a full tub and shower, although the tub was quite small compared to North American standards. The only minor complaint I guess that I would have was that I found the mattress a little too soft. It wasn't so bad that I woke up with a sore back or anything. The hotel is located in one of the nicer districts in Paris, Le Marais, with many shops, cafes, restaurants and museums in the area. We had some good meals nearby and were able to walk to the Picasso Museum a few streets away. The hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful. We did not eat breadfast at the hotel, but it was about 10 Euros. The Metro is within a 10 minute walk up the Rue Rivoli and it is the Hotel de Ville station. Very easy to get to the hotel from the Metro even with luggage. I would recommend this hotel for it's comfort, decor and location. Review #37:What a location!!!!!!!!! -- on the right back between Hotel de Ville and the Marais. Great bistros down the street, a jazz club 10 minutes walk away, shopping to keep one fully occupied. During the day the owner staffs the desk and is most helpful in arranging/confirming dinners, tours, cabs. The evening and weekend receptionists also wonderful folks. The 19 rooms are small...but the high, wood- beamed ceiling makes them seem so much larger. We had a room in the front -- surprisingly quiet -- with a baloney and small table and chairs. Very personal place right in the middle of everything. Review #38:My wife and I recently spent 12 nights at he Caron du Beaumarchais. We totally enjoyed our stay. This is a small hotel, withits lobby filled with antiques. The room was indeed small, however, in our case, we had intensionally selected a sixth floor room with a terrace, with the knowledge that rooms with terraces were smaller. Location in the Marais district was perfect for us. It is centrally located, not inundated with tourists, quite safe and has a very active night life. Although the noise levels from street activity can be high, closing our windows eliminated outside noise. We heard nothing from occupied adjoining rooms. We found the hotel to be meticulously clean and the staff to be helpful beyond anything we could typically expect. I read that one poster complained about the small breakfast. Although the price of the hotel's breakfast was 12 euros, it was more than enough to share for two people. It consists of orange juice, a pot of coffee or tea, a baguette, a croissant, a chocolat au pain, butter, home made jams, yogurt, a hard boiled egg and a kiwi. This was more than adequate for my wife and I to share in the lovely downstairs breakfast room. As this was our first trip to Paris and I personally cannot compare it to other hotels in the city, its location, great staff and personality made it a winner for us. Review #39:This is a perfect example of \"you get what you pay for.\" It's not expensive, nor is it super cheap...so you get an *excellent* location, comfy beds, but subpar linens, microscopic rooms (even the superior rooms are a tight fit for two people with lots of luggage), polite service, but not many amenities (no kitchen/roomservice, spotty wifi, cheap soap). But if you're like me, and you just use your hotel as a place to sleep because you're out all day/night, you'll find this hotel quite comfortable. Review #40:After my first stay at the Caron de Beaumarchais, I cannot fathom a visit to Paris and choosing to rest my head anywhere else. This little hotel is a delight and a gem. Great location, great rooms, great ambiance. Parfait all around! Review #41:After extensive research which included scouring TripAdvisor, Budget Travel's \"Secret Hotels of Paris\", and the NY Times \"100 Hotels Under $150\", I ended up settling on the Caron de Beaumarchais for a labor day weekend trip with my mom. I mostly chose it based on the location (love the Marais--central, charming, and within walking distance of most sights), but ended up loving the charm and overall design of the hotel as well. I was just so pleased with our experience that I decided to write my first TA review! Positives: The staff was incredibly nice and helpful, the room was very clean and a good size for 2 people (by European standards--we stayed in a front side room, which, judging from the reviews, is definitely worth the extra money), beds comfortable, free wifi, AC, and a good sized, delicious breakfast (1 order is more than enough for 2 people). Also the location can't be beat, and the decor of the hotel was so French and charming, without being stuffy and old. Negatives: The walls were a bit thin so in the morning we definitely heard doors slamming etc as housekeeping went in to clean the rooms around us. It wasn't loud enough to wake us up but definitely loud once we were up. Also, some might be annoyed that you have to leave your room key at the desk every time you leave, but reception is 24 hours and it really wasn't an inconvenience for us. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Paris, both my mom and I are very picky and neither of us can recommend it highly enough! Review #42:We based our stay at the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais upon the reviews at Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. This lovely little (6 story) hotel has approx. 17 units, which though small, are quite functional and most importantly, CLEAN. The management is friendly and accommodating. The location is incredible. The hotel is central to transportation, shopping and great cafes. One of the best amenities the hotel offers is WI-FI in the guestrooms. This was important for us and it functioned flawlessly. They offer a petit dejeuner (small breakfast) in their dining area or in your room for 9.80 euros which includes coffee or tea, freshly squeezed orange juice, croissant and baguette with jam. There are so many delightful cafes though in the area that one should avail themselves of the neighborhood offerings. Walking down the street in the morning, you can smell the amazing aromas from the patisseries. The proof of a good hotel is whether you would return and I can positively say that YES, we would return to Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais! Review #43:We have stayed in this hotel many times and have always been very pleased with everything. The location is perfect, right in the middle of Marais, close to Rue Rivoli (but not so close that the traffic is disturbing). The staff is great, always helpful, giving directions, making restaurant reservations, etc. Rooms are small but very nicely decorated with old furniture, a small pot with flowers and bathrobes. Internet is excellent and free. Be sure to have breakfast in the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delicious with yoghurt, a kiwi, three types of jam, baguette, croissant, pain au chocolate and a big pot of really nice coffee. This is without doubt our favorite hotel in Paris! Review #44:My husband and I stayed here for a few days while we visited Paris. We couldn't have asked for a better location - we were in walking distance to the Seine, the Metro, Notre Dame, the Louvre, etc. The staff was very helpful and friendly (and spoke very good English since our French was limited). We had their breakfast each morning, which was not only convenient, but very good and reasonably priced. We found the value to be very good for this hotel considering its excellent location and charming atmosphere. Review #45:My girlfriend and I stayed here in Sept 2006. The rooms are very small but they have bathrooms in the rooms. The building is hundreds of years old and I thought the period furniture and decorations really added to the experience of our trip. We initially had the room without the chandelier and wooden beams but we were able to switch to a room that had the beams and it was very romantic and sweet and a bit larger. The location is excellent (the Marais where the hotel is located is the gay area of Paris so there are quite a few gay bars and restaurants but the hotel is on a quiet street). It's also the hippest area with lots of cute shops, close to the Pompidou and not far (think it was three blocks) to the Metro. It also has an elevator. There's a little cafe on the corner Le Pick-Clops that was great for breakfast and coffee. We would absolutely stay there again. Review #46:I stayed here for three nights with my two small daughters. This hotel is excellent for what it is- a quaint, clean, charming parisian three star in an outstanding location. The rooms are attractive but well organised (mini bar under sink in the bathroom!) and clean. We had a balcony (second floor streetfront room) which was a treat. The air conditioning is excellent, the toiletries, towels and bathrobes are superb, the staff are very friendly and helpful. And the location is incredible, in Marais, a few minutes walk to the Seine, Ile St. Louis, Notre Dame, etc... For a leisure visit to Paris in this price range, I cant imagine anything much better. Highly recommended. Review #47:We stayed at Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais for our first visit to Paris & it was so lovely...although the room was on the small side it was well designed to fit 2 suitcases in without having to move them about each time to move around. The staff were exceptional...upon settling the bill I asked what was the best means of transport to the airport, the concierge advised by taxi & then actually came outside with me to hail down a taxi then proceeded to help with my luggage & spoke to the driver to advise which terminal to go to. It was just the icing on the cake for me!! The only downfall was the fact there was no screen or curtain around the bath to stop the water from drenching the bathroom floor & basin etc Review #48:I really loved this hotel. It was cute and quaint and right in the Marais which is the gay district. To give you a sense where it is, it is about a block from Hotel Bar Central. The rates were more than I wanted to spend being a budget traveler, but it was worth it. The only thing I didnt like, was when I came home from the bars - which was typically anywhere from 2 am to 5 am the lobby was completely dark. You have to ring a bell and wake the night auditor from his sleep to open the door and then he hands you your key to your room (typical to leave you room, but not to wake the guy). Needless to say since I stayed out late, which most younger people do, I also slept in late and maid service is only up until certain times. They will call and let you know the maid is leaving - so at least you can get out if needed. Otherwise the hotel is awesome and very pretty. There is a lift and only 2 rooms per level so it is very quiet. Review #49:We stayed for a total of 6 nights at this perfectly located in the 4th. Our room was small as is typical of Parisian Hotels, but it did not impact our comfort at all. We wanted to be centrally located. The availability of cafes, shops and restaurants was excellent. Although our room was on the street side we slept comfortably without any concern of street sound. The staff were extremely helpful. A wonderful stay at a charming little Parisian Hotel. We utilized the Velib Bicycle System. What a pleasure. After a few disconcerting minutes getting used to traveling at the speed of bike in the city of lights we were comfortable. We travelled all over the city. If you plan on using the bike for less than 7 days still pony up the week few to avoid having the 150 euro deposit being held a number of times. Really make sure the bike is placed back and accounted for. Try to remember where you deposited the bike and its number in case of challenges. We used the Chip and Pin Passport Card from Travelex and it worked perfectly. In our opinion it is the best way to see Paris. In fact on our arrival day since we were still on Mountain Standard Time we were cruising the streets of Paris at 2am. Review #50:We stayed in rooms 20 and 21 for six nights in December after doing a thorough combing of the web and other travel resources to find accommodations in Paris. This hotel is recommended by Budget Travel magazine and Rick Steves among others. Pros: Excellent customer service from all staff-particularly notable was friendly and helpful Genevieve. The breakfast room was clean, bright, and tastefully decorated, and the breakfast was large enough for two people to share. Fresh flowers in the rooms and very good maid service. Our rooms had balconies with tables and chairs and very clean bathrooms. Don't let the lack of shower curtains turn you off--it's not a big deal and the water pressure can be adjusted to prevent spray. The location was fantastic--a short walk to the Hotel de Ville Metro stop and BHV department store. Many dining options close by including L'As du Falafel, Pat's Hot Dogs, gelato, two bakeries, and a small grocery store. We also tried Equinox on Rue de Rosiers (across from the falafel stand) and had a good meal there with helpful servers. Cons: The rooms are small, so packing light is smart.. I could hear sounds from the room above from time to time, but I am a light sleeper. We always looked forward to returning each evening to the Beaumarchais and would strongly recommend it for couples who are searching for an excellent boutique Paris hotel. Review #51:The Marai is really good. Train stations are nearby and it is a short walk to notre dame. Lots of great eateries nearby and good shopping. The hotel is pretty small, but they have definitely made the most of what they have. It is really well decorated - we loved it. Our room was very small, with no view, only an internal window to a void. Still, this was no problem. We found out about this through a hip hotels book and I think the price for here is very good for Paris. Review #52:A week at this small but beautiful hotel, right in the heart of the fabullous Marais district, made our visit to Paris so memorable, The helpful and knowledgable Manager and the exquistely decorated rooms in 19th, century French style makes this place something special. Although not cheap, this hotel offers a truly Parisian experience that complements the many visits to all that is so great about this unique city. Review #53:We chose this hotel after lots of research and with the help of trip advisor. It is located in the Marais district of Paris, a great central area. The area was quaint and full of lovely shops and small restaurants and eateries. Metro stops were close by - we arrived at Orly airport and caught the metro in with no problems. The Hotel was lovely - very ;French\" as we think of it. The beadroom was a good size especially by European Standards. The bathroom was well equiped. The room was airconditoined and windows were double glazed so it was very quiet at night. We were especially impressed with the helpfulness of the staff. They were particularly great at suggesting places to eat - we wanted authetic French food not the tourist interpretation! Review #54:We stayed at this hotel for 6 night, me and my daughter (12 years old). The staff was very polite, english speaker, helpful and nice. The hotel location is great. 3 minutes walking from two Metro stations: Hotel de ville & Saint paul (line 1). 5 minutes by foot to the Marais area and 15 minutes by foot to the Louvre and Place de la Concorde. The rooms are quite small, but beautifully decorated and comfortable. We enjoyed our staying very much. Review #55:I would like to highly recommend this hotel in the 4th district in Paris. It is close to everything. The room was the first one we have ever had in Paris with a real king size bed. Very comfortable. Other places have small beds. Full or queen size futons is the most we have experienced even renting apartments in Paris. It is small but it has an elevator. Very convenient for lots of luggage. Breakfast is optional with a separate charge but it is really like brunch. Lots of hearty chocolate croissants, baguettes, cheese, jam, yogurt and even fresh squeezed orange juice. One breakfast is enough for two... You can go to the small breakfast room or have it in your own room till noon. Decor is full of antiques, attractive and appropriate. We were there for about a week during Xmas 2005, and they had the nice gesture of giving us some chocolates we found in our room. Would love to go back there, very romantic. Appropriate for honeymooners. Review #56:We stayed for 6 nights in May. Had a front room. What a superb location, only minutes to the river. The marais is beautiful. Staff here are wonderful, very helpful in arranging taxi. I highly recommend the breakfast at the hotel, well worth the price. I also recommend dinner at Le Philosphe just up the street (Temple). Review #57:Just of Rivoli in Rue Veille du Temple, this is a great place to stay. Sweetly and classically decorated with a wonderful staff and really close to so much of what Paris offers - and in the extremely cool Marais district. Rooms are small, but that's OK and the bed is the best (and last, before heading home to NZ) we've experienced in 9 months of travel in Europe and USA - and quite a few hotels. In one of the coldest weeks in Paris for a long time it was lovely to come back to the hotel after a long day of sight-seeing. Very good advice from the team: use the buses to get around, instead of the metro. We did to get up to Montmartre and saw a lot more of the city. Fast internet, too... Highly recommended... Review #58:This is a lovely little hotel in a great location in Paris. The rates are between 165 and 185 euros plus 10 euros for breakfast. The breakfast is substantial-soft boiled egg, yogurt, croissant, bread, pain au chocolat, cheese, fruit and jams and honey. The rooms are beautiful period pieces filled with wooden beams, antique furniture and modern TV and air conditioning. They are small but that's Europe. They also have big fluffy robes and a mini bar. Try to get a room with a little balcony. You really feel on vacation sitting at the cafe table on your balcony eating croissants for breakfast. The reception staff are wonderful. They all speak English (or whatever language you need) and they are extremely helpful. They can suggest a restaurant, call you a cab, or point you to the nearest post office. I heartily recommend this hotel and would go again. Review #59:We did our homework online and kept coming back to this hotel and boy are we glad we did. Gracious, clean, helpful, incredible location, etc. Could not ask for more. When we checked in I tried to give Philippe our credit card and he brushed it aside and (in a \"Ctanley with a C\" way) said \"all you need is a great attitude and a smile to check in\". Fresh flowers, CNN on the tv for the little time we were in the room. We walked everywhere, from Amerinos and Berthillon ice cream, to galleries and cafes in the neighborhood (more than you can imagine), a three minute walk to River Seine, can cross right over to Ile St Louis and Il de la Cite. Great tip from hotel staff...at western tip of Il de la Cite there is a one hour river cruise for 12 euro (do not fall for the hundred euro dinner scam) and great cafes back in Marais for dinner. Right around the corner from an open market with various restaurants (but watch out, a few seem deliberately high priced for tourists, others not so much). Subway stops and bus stops close by. The Londerners and New Yorkers who crave a bit of home while there, three minutes away is a Le Pain Quotidien, but there is often a wait. Instead I suggest heading right out the door of the hotel and hit one of the patisseries on the street. Divine. All this within five or ten minutes of the hotel. Rooms are small but as everyone else writes, its Paris. I'm sure the rooms at the Marriott would be larger but also much more expensive and sterile. Would not stay anywhere else next time. It was perfect. Review #60:I stayed at The Caron de Beaumarchais with 3 friends, we booked 2 single rooms and 1 double,for 3 nights and all were ready waiting for us when we arrived. The rooms were all lovely, quite small, but perfectly formed. Very comfortable, with a great bathroom. Lovely reception with pieces of furniture, perfect for the theme. I would recommend the area also, many bars and great restaurants. All in all, a great find! Review #61:We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is elegant and charming, the rooms are a bit small but very comfortable. The staff is friendly and ready to help in case of need. The position is perfect, in the middle of the Marais, and a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk from various metro stations. Breakfast at the hotel is nice, but if you prefer to go outside there are many places around, as \"Le Pain quotidien\", not far away. Definitely a good choice. Review #62:This hotel cannot be beat for location--near the Seine, the Marais and walkable to most everywhere. Service is excellent in both French and English. Rooms are charming--a bit small but not uncomfortable. One note: what they call the courtyard is really an inner atrium--no sunlight on the lower floors and not much air But very quiet and I used the A/C so didn't have a problem. Review #63:This hotel was our first experience in Paris together. We arrived and were greeted by a lovely woman who was exceptionally kind and helpful. When shown to our room we found that it was very typical Paris - small.... very small. My partner and I barely had room to walk around the bed, and found that the bathroom, which was equally as small - had some water spillage issues when it came to showering. There was a man working there, who we found at times to be a little on the rude side - perhaps he had a lot on the go, but his working partner was lovely. The hotel was a very unique experience though, the location was superb! We really loved its centrality and it was lovely when the woman was working , as she was very helpful in finding things and giving us help. I would recommend - if you can afford it - try to upgrade your room, as the ones on the lower floors of course, are much smaller - dark and exposed to noise from the street. Overall - it was a unique first experience, and we really enjoyed ourselves in Paris. Just be aware of the likelihood of classic rooms being quite tiny :) Review #64:I am giving this hotel a 4 star because I really loved the location and the staff were very polite and friendly. However, we had a courtyard room and, as other reviewers mentioned, the courtyard rooms are not very nice at all. In fact, there is no courtyard. What they call a courtyard is an air-shaft with a tiny fake garden and a light. The room was extremely small (I live in New York and it was still small for me!) and the shower was quite strange and hard to use. That being said, we absolutely loved the location with all the wonderful shops and restaurants nearby (the cafe across the road has the best coffee!) and being so close to the Seine is very romantic. We would stay there again but not if we have a courtyard room. Bottomline: Don't stay here if they offer you a courtyard room. You can find much better places elsewhere. Review #65:My husband and I stayed at this oh so French little boutique hotel while honeymooning in Paris. The staff was charming, the location was great. Walking distance to Louvre, shopping, river, Notre Dame, great restaurants, Hotel de Ville and so much more. The Marais district is wonderful. If it's your first time to Paris (or Europe for that matter) be warned, it's even smaller than it looks in the pictures. However, we had a great view of the city and a wonderful stay. Best part: Caron has GREAT croissants and breakfast which they will deliver to your room each morning. We took advantage of this daily. Worst Part: They didn't really get that we were honeymooning, and the staff/owner would call about every hour or so starting at 10 am to see when we were leaving so they could clean the room. Wha? Kind of annoying and probably not so 'hospitable'. Review #66:The hotel is in a great location with lots to do in the area and a short walk to the metro. the rooms are small but they are nice and clean. we a nice balcony that over looked the street, we were near the top so it was not too loud. The biggest downside of the hotel is the shower for some reason none of them have shower curtains. When you shower the entire bathroom gets soaked with water. the staff are very friendly and helpful all speak English and French and are helpful with dinner reservations. Review #67:Charming hotel at the edge of the Marais (between Hotel Ville and Saint Paul) and a few blocks from Rue de Rossier and the best falafel in the world! Close to Rue Rivoli yet quiet. Very tight room (smaller on courtyard side) but had everything we needed. Staff was very accommodating. Free internet but breakfast not included. Who needs breakfast with boulangeries and great coffee all over Paris! Highly recommend. Review #68:My wife and I spent our honeymoon here and we couldn't have asked for anything better! It was our fisrt time to Europe, with not much experience traveling overseas at all so we were a bit nervous as to what to expect. But when we got there, we were greeted very kindly by the staff who helped bring our suitcases upstairs. Might I add that all the staff were able to speak English pretty well which was a plus! The room was small, but very quaint. The sunlight flowing through the room was perfect and brought a special touch to the quaint room. The furnishings were antiques, which was charming and the balcony was the best. We were on the top floor and could see all the roof tops surrounding the area including a couple cathedrals. The breakfasts were actually filling... because they were all breads and pastries! Around the area you can get lost in the streets but its fun... and there's a lot of other cafes around to eat and mingle in. The other good part is that your only about a 5 minute walk from the subway which can take you all around the city at ease. The staff was \"extremely\" helpful in setting up private tours for us, getting us prime tickets to some of the local shows! Also to note is a hotel perk that they may suggest when you're off to dinner. They have deals with certain restaurants and you get a reasonable discount vouture. Really, this was a wonderful and very relaxing place to stay! I'd go back... Review #69:I absolutely loved this place. The location is great for sightseeing, but without being too touristy. It is adorable and serves a fantastic breakfast with pastries from the local patisserie down the street. For Paris and the quality the price is fantastic. I would definitely stay here again when in Paris. Review #70:Very Romantic Hotel in a great location, decorated with antiques, the rooms have exposed beams and you really feel like you are in Paris. We had a street facing room which allowed us to eat breakfast on the balcony and soak up the street scene below, but the windows were thick enough to keep the noise out at night. But what really seperates the hotel from the rest is the service and attention to detail the the hotel provides, the hotel might be a little on the expensive side for the star rating but it is worth it. Only minus is It is a little difficult to get to from the metro if you have much luggage and plan on taking the metro you might want to choose a hotel closer to a RER station. Review #71:We loved this hotel! It is charming, funky, spotless, cool, and the coffee was fabulous. The location is perfect. And, the staff are really the best. They helped us with dinner reservations, gave us directions, and were friendly but not intrusive. Alain's son, the concierge during the week, was shocked when I told him that other hotels charge for wireless internet. He said, \"But this is a service, I offer it to my guests.\" That was typical of their attitude. The rooms are tiny, but that seems to be the price one pays for staying in the Marais, which is well worth it becuase you are so well-located. A great place overall! Review #72:We just stayed at the hotel for one night. The staff was very helpful and spoke good English. The rooms were quite small but basically a standard size for Paris. The location was the main draw card for us as it is right in the middle of The Marais district. Easy walk to the area's many shops, the place des Vosges, Town Hall and even Notre Dame. Would stay again. Review #73:This was our first trip to Paris and we were very favorably impressed with Caron de Beaumarchais. The staff is very nice and helpful, the rooms are extremely clean and the location is very convenient. The room was small (which I understand is completely typical) but it was decorated very nicely with lovely fabrics, sound-proof windows, and a great little terrace with a table and chairs. Bathroom had a tub, mini bar, shower with plentiful hot water and nice marble countertop. We paid 152 euros per night for 8 nights and successfully completed the entire transaction online. They were very responsive especially through email. As an example of the staff's attention to detail, we received a message from a friend staying at another hotel and the receptionist was kind enough to attach a map showing where our friend was staying. Please keep in mind that the hotel is right around the corner from Rue de Rivoli which is a major thoroughfare, so it is not completely quiet. We didn't have much trouble with noise as long as we kept the soundproof windows closed at night. I would definitely stay here again. Review #74:Perfect location in the heart of Paris. The staff was bilingual and very, very helpful. Easy walk to the metro and lots of places to eat near by. Several grocery stores for a snack or wine were around the corner. Beautiful rooms, very comfortable beds and good space for Paris standards. We are planning our next trip before we even check out. Pay for a front room with a small terrace, it is tiny but totally worth it! Wonderful! Review #75:Lovely boutique hotel in Marais between Hotel de Ville & St Paul. All staff very helpful & fluent in English. Although the room was quite small (usual for Paris) it was very beautifully & tastefully decorated with antique furniture, exposed ceiling beams, fresh flowers in room & small balcony. Breakfast was plentiful although we didn't have it every day in the hotel as there were many boulangeries etc nearby. We were two women travelling together to celebrate our 60th birthdays & were very happy that we chose Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais for the real Parisian experience. Review #76:My wife and I recently stayed at the beautiful Caron de Beaumarchais in celebration of our tenth year wedding anniversary. We couldn't have asked for a more quaint, romantic and better located hotel. Room 21, with its cute little balcony overlooking the street, was everything we expected and more. The room was small but beautifully decorated and had everything we needed. The continental breakfast we had delivered to our room was phenomenal. The entire hotel staff was both courteous and extremely helpful. If we're ever in Paris again we will definitely return to this little jewel in the Marais. Review #77:We were in Paris to celebrate my daughter and son in law's wedding at the American Church. Several of our party stayed at Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais. What a lovely and charming place to stay. Friendly and helpful staff made our short stay very pleasant. Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay that takes you back in time. Review #78:We had read about Hotel Caron and have had 4 days there. Nice staff. Very small rooms but of course its Paris. We had a front room on the first floor. Probably next time we would book one with a balcony. The greatest foyer like an interior designers studio. Tiny bathroom with little ventilation. Nice decor, air conditioned. The location in the Marais and proximity to everything was fantastic. Would reccomend. Review #79:I had been wanting to stay at Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais for several years now, but every time I had tried to reserve a room in the past, it was full. This time I was ecstatic when I was able to book a room for one night in March. I corresponded directly with the hotel, and even requested a room with a balcony, as I understood from the reviews here that the view was excellent. When we arrived, we were given a front room on the top floor with a balcony. I knew that the top floor rooms were smaller than the rest, but I was astounded at exactly how small it was. The room was miniscule, even by Parisian standards, and very sparsely decorated, although the exposed beams were lovely. The bathroom was clean but also very small. The balcony was good-sized, but the view was unimpressive (I used to live in Paris in an attic studio with a much better view). However, the reception was friendly if a bit matter-of-fact, and the rest of the hotel (lobby, breakfast room, etc) was charming. Overall, I thought 162 EUR was simply too expensive for the room we stayed in, and after reading the previous review and finding out that the reviewer was only charged 142 EUR for the same room, I'm very disappointed. I may stay here again, as the Marais is my favorite district in Paris, but if I do I'll ask for a larger front room. Review #80:My husband and I spent six nights at the hotel in late June and had a terrific stay. Our first room, on the top floor was very small (even by European standards) but had a sweet balcony. Since we were staying six nights, we asked the hotel to try to change our room to a slightly larger one and they juggled reservations and moved us down two floors to a bigger room (again by European standards) without balcony, which we found more comfortably. The location could not be better, just off the Rue du Rivoli in the happening Marais. We used the municipal bike system to get around everywhere this visit and there was a bike stand just up the block. All the hotel staff spoke English and were very helpful with reservations. The breakfast is the best deal in Paris - served until 12:00 PM for 12 Euro, one breakfast fed us both with leftovers, and an extra pot of coffee, 3 Euro, came with the Herald Tribune. Review #81:Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais is the most adorable hotel there ever was. From the minute you walk into their modest, cozy, and magnificently decorated lobby; you feel as though you have been transported to a time when Marie Antoinette still had her head. The fabric-covered walls, the old instruments, the quant little love seats, and the beautiful fire place; all make you feel as though you are sitting in a piece of Versailles. As for our room, it was wonderful! My mother and I stayed in a room in the front which had a window over looking the street. It was so lovely with the window box full of blooming pink flowers. The room had rustic wood beams on the ceiling, a crystal chandelier, and even a little writing desk with a small vase of flowers, and an ink jar, with a quill. The bathroom was pristine, white, and the towels all had the insignia from the hotel on them. I really enjoyed however, having breakfast in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downstairs. The breakfast room was full of romantic portraits, crystal chandeliers, flickering sconces, and old books that would make the finest historian blush. The tables are covered with lacy linens, and the plates have the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insignia on them as well. I loved the service, and the breakfast was by far one of the best I had in France. The desk was ever so helpful, even the man who owned the hotel. I could not get over how he decorated such a beautiful place. When my mother, and I discussed how much we loved antiquing; he sent us down the street to an antique market. I would love to come back next time I am in Paris! Review #82:My wife and I spent five nights at the Caron during our summer holiday. We very much enjoyed our time there and would return. First off, by American standards, the rooms are tiny. However, by Parisian standards, they are normal sized...considering the price. We had a lovely little room facing the courtyard meaning it was very quiet. Because of abnormally warm temperatures, the air conditioning in the room was true luxury. So many 3-star hotels in the area do not have A/C. As spoiled Americans, we like our rooms pretty cold and this was accomplished at the Caron. The staff at the hotel were simply wonderful. They were very helpful and attentive to all requests. They provided excellent restaurant suggestions, were very adept and helping us navigate the Metro system, and even assisted us with using their complimentary wireless internet when my laptop was not cooperating. Our room was always immaculately cleaned and the maids left plenty of towels for us as well. American travelers, another warning: many of the bathrooms have tub/showers without shower curtains. We were worried about soaking the bathroom by using the shower without a curtain and were told, \"no worries.\" Took a little getting used to, but end of the day, it was, indeed, all good. While the staff at the Caron is wonderful and the rooms lovely, the best part of the hotel is its location. The Caron is located near several Metro stops and is within easy walking distance of so many sites. We loved be so close to everything. We also loved the \"vibes\" of the neighborhood and walking the streets of the Marais. Also enjoyed the farmer's market which set up on Saturdays and Wednesday's just across the square from the Hotel. Are the better hotels in Paris? No doubt, yes. However, if you want to stay in the Marais and have a staff treat you as a special guess, there are few better places than the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais. Review #83:My wife and I enjoyed our recent 4 night stay at Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais. (This was our first trip to Paris). The hotel itself has a casual, comfortable atmosphere. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, and staff extremely frieindly. The rooms are typically Euro-small but the bathrooms were larger than expected. I booked this reservation by simply communicating directly with the hotel by e-mail in english. The process was easy and they promptly replied to all inquiries. We requested (at time of booking) and a \"front side\" room, which looks out over the street. They have less-expensive rooms on the back side but they get less sunlight and don't offer much of a view. Our assigned room was on the 3rd floor and gave us a nice street view from the large windows which open wide. We were not able to obtain a 5th floor balcony room, although requested. (I got the vague impression that these sought-after rooms may be reserved for returning customers). The location of this hotel was absolutely perfect. We loved the Marais district ,and the hotel is a short walk to the Seine and Cathedral Notre Dame. There are many cafes, bakeries, and restaurants in the immediate area. Metro and RER stations are not far. The Marais is a lively area at night with pedestrian activity. We felt very safe. The hotel's Rue Veille du Temple is a charming one-way street but is definitely not a \"quiet side street\". One negative aspect to our stay was the street noise late at night which we could hear from our hotel room ---- frequent buzzing of motorbikes, the familiar french police siren passing by on the nearby Rue du Rivoli ( a main thoroughfare), and on the weekend occasional yelling from young partiers as they walked down the sidewalk. But I guess that's to be expected when staying in such a location On our next trip to Paris, we would definitely consider staying again at this charming boutique hotel. But perhaps push for a higher room on the 4th or 5th floor. Review #84:I would echo fully the sentiments expressed in the review from Mensa Traveller (April 2007). My wife and I have just returned from our first visit to Paris celebrating our 44th Wedding Anniversary (Honeymoon!!). Please God we will return to this hotel again to further explore Paris. A front room is ESSENTIAL.The breakfast room is a treasure. A two or three day pass on the Batobus boat is worthwhile. You can hop on and off and you can access most of the sites from the river and it does not have the language problems that the Metro has. Our experience of Parisiens was of friendliness and courtesy. Our best wishes to Neil and Sharon (a real honeymoon couple from Toronto) with whom we shared breakfast and some laughs. Pat & Rita Conneely, Dublin, Ireland. May 2007 Review #85:We had the opportunity to stay at this charming hotel for four nights in April. The location of the hotel is very good in the middle of Marais. The hotel itself is amazingly cute and the staff was very nice to us. The gentleman who met us at check in was very nice suggesting some good walks around the area and some good trips around the must-sees in Paris. Our room facing the street had a small balcony which we unfortunately could not use since the weather was not the best. But if possible, a breakfast at the balcony must for sure be a nice way to start the day. The room was very cute with lots of charming details and although the interior was neither modern nor up to date it fitted the old property perfect and altogether the atmosphere was fantastic. The only draw back was that for us to tall Scandinavians the bed was to small with our feet hangning out and the bathroom required some acrobatic moves. The room in all was very small, but on the other hand you don't spend too much time in the room when you have all of Marais just out the door. There was free wifi which worked pretty good. I loved the area, with lots of nice bistro and bars as well as many small and interesting little shops. There was of course lots of tourists but still the whole area felt less touristy than for example the area around seventh or eight arrondisement. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel, room and service was excellent and the interior absolutely marvellous. The area was beautiful and we spent most of our vacation just browsing through the neighbourhood. Review #86:We stayed here on the recommendation of a friend. First, the positives. The location is terrific. It's very close to two Metro stops and within walking distance of the Louvre and Notre Dame. There are also a lot of very good cafes and bistros in the neighborhood. The hotel was clean and well maintained. The mini fridge was great to store our fruits, cheese and vegetables for our \"picnic\" lunches. The service was impeccable and very friendly. The morning breakfasts are worth the 12 Euros consisting of a variey of breads and croissants, excellent coffee, kiwi fruit, natural yogurt and a boiled egg. Overall, I think you get good value for the money. Now the negatives. Our room was quite small and so was the double bed. The bathroom had a handheld shower, but no shower curtain. So, we had to have a bath, then rinse off sitting in the tub using the handheld shower. We live in New York, so we're used to a certain amount of street noise. People who live in quieter environments might want a room off the street. Overall, I'd say the hotel was worth the 152 Euros per night, but next time we go to Paris, we'll ask about the size of the beds! Review #87:Our party of 4 - a couple and 2 older ladies stayed here in September. The hotel is charming, located near Rue de Rivoli in the Marais. Shops, restaurants and bars on every street. Lots of life and fun. The rooms are tiny but very sweet and truly soundproofed - close the windows and you never hear street noise - or other guests except for occasional hallway sounds. The balcony overlooking Vielle du Temple was also tiny but useable (though difficult for the older ladies). The mini bar with every item priced at 3E was handy and international calls from the room phone were very reasonable. We found the staff helpful and friendly. We split a single 12E breakfast between us at the staff's suggestion & it was plenty. It is a huge breakfast for one person. This lovely inn is a GREAT choice for a couple or friends & a great location that's close to lots of sites - the Seine, Notre Dame, the Louvre, Centre Pompidou, the Picasso Musee, Place de Vosges etc. as well as buses, taxis (hint: carry a hotel business card with you for the taxi driver). The lift was larger than others I'd seen at Paris hotels - room for 2 people plus luggage (though not much more). We loved it. Review #88:We spent two weeks here in December 2011. The staff was always helpful. They gave us directions on many occasions, made r\u00c3\u00a9servations for us for dinners, and made shuttle arrangements for us to th\u00c3\u00a9 airport. Samira, who brought us breakfast every morning, was a delight, even on Christmas morning when I'm sure she would have pr\u00c3\u00a9f\u00c3\u00a8rred to be home. The h\u00c3\u00b4tel is in a fabulous location, within true walking distance of Centre George Pompidou, Notre Dame and th\u00c3\u00a9 Picasso Museum (although it is closed for r\u00c3\u00a9novation). Although the h\u00c3\u00b4tel very close to two m\u00c3\u00a9tro stops, it is on bus line 69, which goes to the Louvre, Musee D',Orsee, Eiffle Tower, Musee Rodin, Rue Cler and H\u00c3\u00b4tel de ville. I can't say enough good things about this h\u00c3\u00b4tel. But it is only as good as the people who work there and they are all tops. Review #89:We stayed at the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais for two nights. Since it was our mini-moon after having just got married, expectations were high and they were amply met. The location is unbeatable; the Seine, Louvre, Pompidou, Ille de St Louis, Musee d'Orsay, Bastille etc are all an easily walkable distance and there is also the achingly pretty environs in which the hotel is immediately situated, Le Marais. As others have said, the staff are fantastic. They speak very good English but also encourage your burgeoning French too if you have a go! They helped us with lots of things like fighting for a taxi to take us to Gare du Nord (the staff member rolled up her sleeves and fought through Paris rush hour to flag one for us! - about approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 to Gare du Nord), reconfirming our restaurant booking and posting letters home. A big hit in our room was the breakfast in bed. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13 for a tray containing fresh pastries and french bread, hot chocolate, yoghurt, a soft boiled egg, homemade jams, cheese, fresh orange and a kiwi. All served with a copy of the Herald Tribune. Perfect. My partner and I enjoyed lounging around in the Hotel's bath robes and writing letters on the pretty stationery provided. The room was very charmingly decorated with period furniture and detail. To make for a balanced review, I will say that we were initially disappointed that the room was smaller than expected and the bed was two singles pushed together and that we didn't have a balcony but that quickly wore off because everything was so pleasant and the beds are very comfortable. The room had the gorgeous French windows that maintained that authentic Parisian experience, even without the balcony. We'd definitely return to the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais, though I think we'd struggle because the phone was ringing nearly off the hook with bookings when we sat in reception! Do not hesitate to book this place. I would recommend it very highly indeed. Review #90:This was my second return to this hotel and i'm sure I will return again for my next trip to Paris! It is in an amazing location, right in the heart of the Marais and close to the river, perfect for exploring Paris from. The hotel is charming and beautiful, rooms are pretty with wonderful fabric walls, furnishings, comfy beds and white clean bathrooms. The rooms are fairly small however a good size for Paris. We had a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony. The balcony was a nice addition as we could sit outside and watch Paris life go by below. However it was noisy at night time, especially compared to the room we had last year at the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard. Bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The breakfast is lovely and very large - one to share between 2 of us was ample! The staff are so friendly and helpful! This place is a real gem and a joy to stay in! Review #91:The hotel is situated just off the Rue de Rivoli in the Marais district. It is a perfect spot for exploring the local area and very close to several Metro stations. There are loads of restaurants and bars within easy reach. The hotel is wonderfully quirky - the decor transports you back in time to the 18th century and is certainly rather different from the usual bland, modern hotels. Room was small (expected in Paris) but was clean and extremely quiet - no traffic or street noise at all. Reception was very friendly and helpful with some good ideas for evening meals. We didn't try the breakfast - at 13 euros a bit pricey - but there is plenty of choice in the nearby cafes. It's not the cheapest but you're paying for something a bit different in a brilliant location. Would heartily recommend. Review #92:What your other reviewers seem to have missed is that this hotel is one of the most highly recommended hotels for the gay community. That is why it is so comfortable. Just as the Marais is the gay heart of Paris, so Le Caron is its most popular hotel. Review #93:I have been to Paris many times. I have stayed in many 3-star hotels. All were perfectly fine. However, Caron de Beaumarchais was the best Paris hotel experience I have ever had... and this was due almost entirely to the amazing service of the hotel reception staff. All of them (and especially Genvieve and Etienne) went out of their ways to help us. Sometimes we just needed directions or for our restaurant reservation to be confirmed. Othertimes, when my phone was lifted by street kids, they allowed - at no additional charge to us - phone calls back to the States to get everything squared away. The hotel is quite charming, the decor is classic French... everything is elegant and tasteful. The room we stayed in was the tiniest room I have ever stayed in. And, truth be told, at the beginning of our trip, we were a little concerned about the room size (even though I am quite familiar with small Paris hotel rooms), but by the end of the stay, we were never more grateful to have chosen this hotel. The rooms are comfortable, well cared for, quiet, and the beds are comfortable. But the NUMBER ONE REASON to stay at this hotel is the service (especially if Genvieve and Ettiene are still working there). I get the feeling that the management/owners of this hotel feel that customer service is priority one, so probably all future staff will also have similar attitudes about helping their clients. Highly-recommend. Review #94:I have just stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in april, it was just what I expected. Absolutely perfect location just off the rue de rivoli. So many restaurants/bars/sites close to the hotel. The rooms are small but I have been told this is how Paris hotels are. We chose not to have breakfast here as it seemed quite expensive and you could walk to a local cafe for a coffee and crossiant quite easily. Overall it was a lovely stay, it is quite expensive but wouldnt have been so bad if the euro was better!! I would recommend this hotel to anyone especially for a romantic trip. Review #95:My partner and I stayed here during October 2010 for 7 nights in a courtyard room. We loved it - much has already been said about the place but it's a great location and even though the rooms are small (where isnt in Paris? ), we found the place very comforting and a great base for sightseeing. Review #96:We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais. The staff was extremely helpful, giving us great advice on restaurants and arranging a van to take both of us to the airport for 20 Euros. The neighborhood the hotel is in is quintessential Paris. It is an easy walk to the Hotel Deville metro station. The little elevator might be hard to handle if you are claustrophobic and the rooms are small, but wasn't a problem for us. Would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Review #97:The hotel is nicely positioned in le merais and close to metro. The reception staff are very helpful and booked us a lovely restaurant for Christmas dinner. Also ask for shuttle transfer to the airport for only $20 for 2 people! Extremely cheap and reliable. The room is small but the norm for French hotels. Free in-room wifi included. The bed only came with a sheet and an old blanket for winter temperature so we had to rug up to sleep. The bathroom has the basic fit out but the lack of a shower curtain meant the bathroom was quite wet after the shower. Overall, nice stay but room for improvement. Review #98:Stayed 6 nights in a front facing room with a balcony on the 5th floor. At the time of booking it seemed very expensive but when we got there we could see why. The room was small but perfect, with beautiful French period decor and antique furniture. The bathroom was clean and modern. The balcony was tiny but the views towards Notre Dame were amazing. Staff could not have been more pleasant and spoke perfect English, but were also happy to let me practice my rusty French! Location couldn't be better - near all the main sights, metro and train stations, in the heart of the Marais meaning we never had to go far for dinner or drinks. The area was always buzzing but noise was never a problem. Only downside is the price but it's worth it to be so central. Highly recommended. Review #99:Stayed here with friends for two nights in September and loved it. The staff is especially friendly here - helping with directions, recommendations and making reservations at restaurants. Everyone working the front desk speaks perfect English, so for those with limited French skills, this is very helpful. I stayed in a courtyard room and (contrary to some other people's experiences, I guess) very much enjoyed it. Although the room is tiny and the view is not much to speak of, the room and bathroom were immaculate with a few old world charms (exposed beams in the ceiling, gaslight lighting fixture) and modern conveniences (flat screen television). I especially loved the little touches in this hotel like the cotton robes, the bath mitt, and the fabric padded walls. One drawback that other reviewers have mentioned before is that there is no shower curtain for the tub, so you probably can't take a shower standing up without getting the bathroom completely drenched. However, if you take a shower sitting in the tub, it is completely fine - just takes some getting used to. For the good price, location, and services you get with this hotel, I think it's a small price to pay to learn to shower a slightly different way.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

It was hard to find a clean breakfast table at the Hilton Honors lounge though, as the supervisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean the tables.

Rate are cheap, but breakfast was not included and hotel charges $20 for breakfast buffet. I bit too much for the USA and the quality is mediocre at best. Rooms are spacious, but dated. Hotel could do with a refurbishment. Pool was dirty. Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing. Review #1:This hotel was booked for us through our travel agent - it was near the airport & near the port of Miami where we were leaving on a cruise. Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line. The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet! We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier. Since we paid $210 for the night I thought we'd get free parking - we used the valet service for $28 (plus tips) which we found pricey also. We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff. And it is a very lovely place. Review #2:Despite some negative comments that we read on this site we still decided to give the Hilton a chance because the location was perfect for our trip. I must say we were extremely disappointed with our stay there. The renovations were the least of our worries. The room was nice. We had a Jr. Suite with the Bay view. The room was very spacious and nicely put together. HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk. They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room. They would leave dirty glasses and leave new ones and they did not change the sheets. VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window. We made a complainant and were told we could have a free breakfast. When we went to retrieve the breakfast we were told that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it and were accused of lying about getting a free breakfast. FRONT DESK: Members of the front desk staff were extremely rude and condescending!! Messages are not sent to the manager but rather put to the side. We finally spoke to one front desk manager who compensated us for one nights stay because of our troubles. We were pleased until the day of check out when we dealt with an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153assistant front desk manager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who gave us trouble with our reimbursement. Long story short it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing I spent more time out of the hotel than in because my stay at the Downtown Miami Hilton could have ruined my entire vacation. Review #3:One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping. Don't really need this on holiday especially when you have been out really early say on an excursion and you return late afternoon/early evening to find room not cleaned or replenished. Excursions booked via hotel consierge could only be paid for with cash. As previous review on Hilton Bentley this seems to be a policy throughout the Miami area. Other travellers we spoke to experienced the same. Cannot even charge to room account. Bar service at busy times was a little haphazard - incorrect orders although they did make amends for errors. Pool area although at roof level and could be quite a haven staff appeared once again overwhelmed at busy times - could not keep on top of towel demand and allowed guests to bring bottles/glasses into the pool area. One issue with the executive lounge access - hotel literature stated the lounge should have been open from 6.00 am - this was not the case and when we arrived on one occasion to grab breakfast before leaving for the day we were told to \"try later lounge not opening yet staff had not arrived\". We felt that an establishment of this nature in this location and carrying the Hilton brand should have made staff available to man the lounge at the times stated. That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers. Review #4:A group of three of us stayed at this motel during October 9th thru October 13th. My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time. Upon arrival at the motel my party was told that we couldn't be checked into a room despite paying our trip in advance because they were having issues receiving payment from the vendor. We had our payment receipts and confirmations in hand and had also called in advance to confirm before arriving. We have to stand around for about two hours before being checked in. Upon checking in the room they assigned us was the wrong type. We had to go back downstairs to be assigned another room. When were assigned a new room the keys didn't work so we had to go back to have them activated. The room we finally received was very nice. We stayed in 724 which was a one bedroom suite. It was very spacious and well kept. On the upside the manager bought us dinner and drinks at the restaurant for our inconvenience at check-in and he was very apologetic and nice. The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great. For the most part the staff was very professional and on top of their job. There was a male bartender that in my opinion was very rude, unprofessional and obviously doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like his job, but that was my only negative encounter. We didn't rent a car upon arrival, but met a really nice cab driver who took us everywhere we wanted to go for the whole time we were there. This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami. One of the downsides to this motel is the location. There is no food or entertainment around. There is a Checkers and a Burger king across the street. Overall the stay at this Hotel was satisfactory. Review #5:I found the hotel staff to be very welcoming and accommodating. They provided me a room with a great view, and my room was very clean and equipped appropriately. The hotel restaurant was adequate; however, the staff here also strived to please. The view of the bay was incredible, and my bed was very comfortable. A huge group of teenagers were staying in the hotel, and kids were all over the place until late at night...flooding the lobby, elevators, and public space. I finally had to take my drink from the bar to my room as a result of all of the noise and lack of supervision. Kids were in the hallway during the night slamming doors and making noise. I called the front desk, they responded, but little control over the situation. I would hope that there would be a cerfew and expectations of adult supervision in the future as I got little sleep as a result of the noise. Other than the noise and kids, it was a good hotel. Review #6:This hotel is nice , but for a business traveller is far from ideal , i arrived with no sleep and had to pop a coupe of earplugs to be able to , the beds are great and rooms are spacious and beautiful view but the walls are paper thin and you can hear crystal clear conversation tvs sex ect coming from the other room ,you can also hear the hallway noise amplified times 4.. there is no minibar which is also quite annoying when u are in business as usually you need drinks and snaks at hand ,, room service was ok and inexpensive compared to other Hiltons I have been at ..had the Chicken quesadillas which where not bad but artificial cheese , beware ... this hotel is far from everywhere touritsy and you need a car or taxi to move around , this was not an issue for me as i only needed the room to sleep and eat and had a driver.. an Ok hotel but too noisy to book it again , probably best for a group and tourist trip, avoid if in Buisness and looking for peace Review #7:Stayed here for 2 nights - excellent value for money! Spring fling rate of $125 which included a food credit for $50, champagne and late check-out. Our room was nicely decorated, great linens, flat screen tv and a beautiful view of Miami skyline. As we had a car ,the location was not a problem.South Beach is just a short drive across the bridge and we took a taxi to Bayside.We ordered room service for breakfast and it was excellent. Review #8:This is my second night here at Hilton hotel downtown miami. I love love love it!!! Clean and spacious,everybody is very polite and helpfull. Thank you all for making our stay unique!!! My only reccomendation would be providing free WiFi connection up in the rooms.not only at the lobby. I would love to enjoy that when i return. This is definetely not my last time here!! We still have two more nights to enjoy here!!! A beautiful place!! We feel so VIP;-) Review #9:We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Miami Downtown. It pays to have be a Gold member of Hilton Honors. We were upgraded to a much nicer room with a terrific view of the water and access to the concierge room. Cold water bottles in their mini fridge, fruit, complimentary breakfast in the morning! What more could we ask! Excellent customer service. Review #10:Selected this hotel for a group/work event. Working with Domingo in sales was the best part about this. He consistently had suggestions that were perfect. I don't generally plan events for work and so Domingo took the helm and provided the direction needed. The meeting rooms and lodging rooms were very nice. You don't generally go wrong with a Hilton. In this case, it was the staff that made the event run smoothly. Also, the food was far above the standard conference selection. Review #11:My wife and I stayed here as a 1 night pre-cruise hotel. I had bid on this thorugh one of those \"find out the name after you commit\" websites. We got the room, taxes and breakfast for $90. Excellent value. The room was great especially the bedding. Each of the staff we had interactions with were very helpful. Next time I go to Maimi I will stay at the Hilton. The hotel is a very short walk from the Metromover whcih we took to Bayside Marketplace. Review #12:I won't restate what has been said in earlier reviews. This is a stay overnight for a cruise hotel. I am on business and an $8 cab ride to downtown. The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace. The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies. The one issue i must stress is do not--I repeat--do not take the overhead train cars to or from the hotel area after 6pm. Regardless of what you are told it is not safe for anyone. If you don't know the system you will go around in circles and the cars are invested with local hoodlums and drunks. There is no police presence...ever! Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight. They don't get off they just ride in circles and look for trouble. There were two young girls on board that were terrified...I told them to get off the tram with me--they did and I put them in a cab to their hotel. I have been travelling to Miami for years and it just gets worse every year. The downtown is a ghost town except for a couple of hotels and Bayside. Do not wander off the main strip! One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste. I complained to the \"manager\" and she told me that it was \"their culture\". Huh? So, if you are staying one night and then heading to the cruise terminal it is fine...anything more than that look at a more upscale place in a better area of town. Review #13:I had great difficulty getting a room in Miami as it was Super Bowl week end and so used some HHonors points to stay here. I was delighted to be upgraded to Executive Level something I don't think Starwood or IC Hotels do when using points. The hotel was full and jumping with lively but good natured Colts fans and had a fantastic atmosphere. In spite of everything, the hotel coped very well and it was great - food, staff, room, lounge all excellent. Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities. Bayside Plaza is a short taxi ride away which is a lot of fun especially on Super Bowl week end and the Metromover is just a block away which gives access to Metrorail. This will get you to Dadeland Mall, a good place for shopping and gifts to take home. Review #14:This hotel was great. My girlfriend and I got it for a great price. The room was very nice, as was the bathroom. The room was quite large. The bed was extremely comfortable and the AC worked beautifully. It was very clean. Service was friendly and on top of things. Concierge desk was extremely helpful (leave a tip). Room service was great - they had great 24 hour food - try the conch chowder, the conch fritters, key lime pie - I could keep going, everything was delicious. The restaurant inside the hotel had delicious plates and the breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and delicious. The outdoor pool and patio were awesome and not even that busy. The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants. After 6 nights at South Beach right beside Ocean Drive, this hotel and downtown Miami (particularly Bayside) were a great escape for us. Relaxing versus the 24 hour party going on at South Beach (though that was great as well). This hotel was just great, exactly what you would expect from a Hilton. This hotel was awesome. Review #15:We asked for Towels - 5 minutes later they were there We had room service - said it would take 25 minutes - was there in 15 We needed more pillows - there in 10 minutes Housekeeping was a pleasure and our room was always made up early. The value is terrific and attention makes it even more stellar. They Aim to please and have true hospitality - Review #16:I thought I would be staying downtown but this hotel is about 1 1/2 miles north of the downtown center. The hotel, its rooms and amenities were all very nice. The staff was accommodating and friendly. They did charge for wifi however, which seems unnecessary. Some tips: The parking is very expensive - $35 for valet and $25 for self-park. After paying the first night, i parked on 17th Terrace north of hotel the second night for free. If you are not leaving the hotel early, you pay $1.50 per hour between 7am and 10pm. A quick stroll in the morning up 5 blocks to the tiled Barcardi building is worthwhile. Review #17:pros: Room was clean though a little tight and the city view was great at night. Friendly stuff. Coffee was amazing. cons: the first floor was for moter. Valet parking was over $25. The main lobby was not actually on the second floor - confusing. TV was not functioning properly. Review #18:Nice, clean hotel with great view. I enjoyed staying here but I don't understand why there isn't free internet like in all other hotels I stayed in during my 3-week vacation. Free internet is available only in lobby downstairs and if you want internet in your room, you have to pay for it. That's a big MINUS. If you have a car, you have choice of vallet parking or self parking. Review #19:The hotel itself was great. Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards. When we tried to get answers, he waved his hands in our face and dismissed us and told us to talk to someone else in the morning. But other than that, not a bad place to stay. Review #20:My two daughters and I stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise. I had prepaid for a junior suite and requested a higher floor room with a nice bayview and early check-in if possible. I also told the front desk manager Christopher that it was a special trip as both my daughters had birthdays. When we got to the hotel, around 11a.m, room wasn't ready, but they checked our bags and we went straight to the pool. I was told they would put a rush on getting the room ready and they asked for my cell phone. By 12:30 p.m, I got a call on my cell phone to inform me our room was ready. Beautiful room, gorgeous view. I called to thank Christopher and he even remembered that my girls had birthdays and sent up some treats for them. Thank you so much!! The only thing I found strange was that there was no mini fridge in the room, even for a suite our size. Review #21:I was a bit worried from the reviews about the Hilton. After staying there, I think some of these people that complain either are used to staying at the Ritz-Carlton or just too damn picky. We got there on Thursday night and didn't have to stand in any lines to check in. The front desk guy was nice enough to give us a room facing the bay after we requested it although what they had available was on the 4th floor. The room had two huge windows with a nice view and it was nice and cleanly decorated. The buffet breakfast (whcich was part of the room rate) was very good I must say, although it was the same every day, but we didn't mind). We were able to grab some bottles of water and fruit on our way out for the day. Another positive was the free internet service in the lobby (they had 3 computers you could use as well as wireless if you had a laptop) We were also able to avoid paying the $28 parking fee by parking across the street at a meter and then making sure we moved our car in the morning. Everything was pretty close and accessible from the hotel (Bayside, South Beach, Coconut Grove etc.) Of course the downside was that the elevators were slow, depending on what time of the day it was ..but the way people complain on here, you would think it was the end of the world. It really was not that bad if you had 2-3 minutes of patience. Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast. Review #22:Hotel was ideally located for the purpose of my business trip. However the Hotel has an old feel to it and the surrounding areas outside the hotel was a bit rundown and had a grimy feel. On check in the room I was assigned was very smoky smelling but they moved me to a suite with a better view. Review #23:After reading all the bad reviews I expected a real dump. That was not the case although this is not a hotel you want to book for a special occasion. The rooms are ok. Clean, quiet at night and good beds. Nothing special though. Our room had a balcony that we couldn't use because of all the construction going on. Tools and debris were lying on the balcony. The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel. Tip for runners: It's a nice run from the hotel towards Miami Beach (which is only 4k away). Review #24:A few weeks ago I visited this beautiful hotel and I stayed only one night because I was taking a cruise. People was very nice to me there, specially in the front desk where I was told about all amenities. Nice room with a nice bay view. At night and in the morning service was excellent in the concierge lounge attended by Luis who did a great job. I would recommend this hotel and I would stay myself there anytime. Review #25:i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, found the hotel clean and friendly, good bar area and resturant... I did not like the area the hotel was in i would of prefered south beach area. Although the hotel was only a taxi drive away from south beach. Overall i found this hotel to be one of the nicest hotels that i have stayed in, we flew to miami from vegas and arrived at 7.30am we were able to check in which was great staff were very helpfull. Review #26:Hotel was convenient to and from Miami airport via SuperShuttle ($16 to and from here) and to cruise ship at nearby port. I came a day before the departure of my cruise and thank goodness because my bag did not make the flight, even though I'd checked in 2 hours before the flight. As the hours wore on, I became increasingly agitated with United Airlines which could not confirm with certainty the location of my bag or when it would be delivered. I called often and continued to get unsatisfactory answers. However, finally, just before the last shuttle departure to the port, a very nice bellman at the hotel let me look around the storage room and lo and behold there was my bag (I had been previously assured that it could not be at the hotel). It could have been there 10 minutes or 10 hours, who knows--a bellman had accepted delivery and never reported it to anyone. I was so happy to have the bag and reported back to the chief concierge, Yasser, what had happened so maybe someone else wouldn't have this same mix up. He escorted me to the shuttle, heard me out, talked to the bellmen and was extremely kind. When I returned to the hotel after my cruise, I learned that I had been upgraded to a suite--yay! So even though there was a mix up with my bag which caused me some frustration and sleeplessness, the Hilton more than made up for it. This hotel deals with lots of \"cruisers\" and the location is so convenient next to the port --I could see my ship from my hotel window. The views of the skyline and the port are terrific. The service overall is excellent. Good amenities without a lot of nickel-and-diming, eg, free high-speed Internet with 5 or 6 terminals and connected printers. Nearby Bin 18 is a wonderful restaurant, and was recommended by the concierge (David, who was also very helpful and nice). Review #27:This was a great hotel. Stayed here during re NBA finals. The rooms are really nice and clean and the staff is amazing. Just need to watch out for all the greedy homeless people outside. Looks like the projects are just a few blocks away from the hotel and these folks come at you over and over. Never had a bum get angry and call me names because I didn't give him anything. He forgot I gave him a few dollars the day before. Also DO NOT GO TO THE RALLY'S ACROSS THE STREET. this is the worst joint ever. It tool almost 30 min to make some food an no one else was there other than the homeless people that kept asking to get their cup refilled for them. Sorry diverted from the hotel but it was perfect! ! Review #28:Booked AAA Stay and Park. Great rate for a room to accomodate 4 persons. Large room. Very comfortable beds. Fantastic view from 19th floor. Excellent service. Beautiful common areas, lounge, lobby, pool. Stayed post cruise for 1 night only. Wished we had longer to stay. Will always return to Hilton if in Miami. Only negative, which is not fault of Hilton was road construction on Biscayne blvd. Noise never a problem, just navigating the in and out of hotel slight challenge. Car rental agency at location a plus. Review #29:I spent 2 nights here for a business trip. This is an older hotel but seems to have been renovated fairly recently. One annoyance, the first suite assigned to me was already occupied! Second room was upgrade to huge corner junior suite with nice view thru floor-ceiling windows of Biscayne Bay and cruise ship harbor. Hotel was packed with south american tourists but my corner room was quiet. Location is a little awkward to enter due to road construction. 2 sets of elevators and 2nd floor lobby layout is confusing at first. High parking rates unless you get park & stay AAA rate (I did). Good restaurant. Good Chinese restaurant in Doubletree next door. Room was in good condition and seemed fairly recent renovation. Review #30:We stayed here for 2 days before our cruise out of Miami. The hotel seemed renovated and it was clean and beautiful. We had a room on the 14th floor overlooking downtown Miami. The view was amazing. The room itself was huge compared to other hotels I've stayed at. The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel close to the Miami port and I would definitely stay here again. Review #31:Stayed the night prior to our cruise, was a $15 taxi ride to the airport the next day. Reserved a king sized bed through lastminutetravel, however was not available when we arrived. The staff upgraded us to larger room, with a terrific view of the downtown and port. I would always ask for an upgrade if you dont already that that room. as a side not they had $2 beers in the bar which was quite nice Review #32:I travel to Miami on a regular basis and always stay here when the rates are competitive. It is in downtown Miami, so it makes sales calls very convenient for me. The rooms overlooking the bay have fantastic views. The food is decent, nothing great, but Bayside is just a short drive or 20 min. walk in one direction and there are more places to eat in the other direction. The pool area is nice and the water is just two blocks away. It is by no means a South Beach property (thankfully). The staff is very friendly and they always remember me. The only complaint I have is the required $28 per day for parking, but this is Miami and any decent place will charge you for parking. The valet employees are very quick and nice. Review #33:Our waitress, Angeleena, was exceptionally nice to us weary travelers, night of January 16, 2012. We wanted to get dessert to take to our room. Our room could have been better, candy wrappers in the dresser drawers and a pair on men's underwear crumpled up by the picture window. Review #34:First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business. for the price, it's OK, nothing more. Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls. We all know hotel phones are pricey, so we kept the calls short, but even still - the rates aren't advertised anywhere in the room. Coming from Europe, it takes some time to get used to the \"rip me off at every corner\" culture in the States, but this was just going too far. Really abusive. So the hotel - fine, for the cost, if you have to be downtown, it's an OK choice. Phone - don't go near it. Review #35:I travel about every week for business and stay in the Hilton/Hilton chain for the points and usually my stays are fine there. This was my first and last time at the Hilton downtown Miami. Where do I start? Checking was fine and the room view was outstanding...that's the good. Valet service is god awful. There Is a dedicated attendant in a booth working but she doesn't pick up her phone...what's the point. Then when I got my car 10 minutes later the attendent just handed me my keys and walked away...a total joke. The room,...bathroom had hair on the sink and tub. The ventilation system (not the ac) was loud and could not be turned off...I am not the type that needs total silence to sleep but I was counting the days to get the he'll outta here. I was 5 rooms away from the elevator and the noise in the hall of just the elevator was annoying. I asked to change rooms and was met with attitude and a \"check back later, we have no rooms left\". I just smiled and went to work. You need to take an elevator to get to the registration. Then after registration you need to walk to a different set of elevators across the hotel to get to your room. A design genius put this hotel together clearly. My lesson! All Hiltons are not the same. I will be back on business in Miami soon and am damn sure I'm not staying here. Don't make the same mistake I did. Review #36:This is a very nice hotel, especially for the price. I was skeptical of the quality because of the great rates. I was pleasantly surprised. Within 5 minutes of arriving, three different employees greeted and welcomed our family . First impressions count. Huge windows with great views. Extremely comfortable beds. Two fast food restaurants across the street. Even though we booked on a discount site, we felt like important guests. Gorgeous pool. We needed extra pillows and towels - to our room in 10 minutes with a smile. This hotel should definately be rated higher. Review #37:I too saw a number of marginal comments however I stayed at the hotel in the begining of October. I was on the 8th floor. The view was inrcedible. Folks, I travel often and certainly know the difference between hiding quality service and providing quality service. If you are not the type of person who is trying to find something wrong, you will love this place. It is in downtown so you have to cab or drive to Miami beach but you know that upon reservation. I suggest the cab. It cost me 6.00 one way. 10.00 after the tip. So for 20.00 you get a safe way to and from the SOBE area. The rooms are clean and truly comfortable. The complaints you see are not accurate. Now, if you are a person who can find something wrong at any hotel than do not stay here. Because you will complain that the elevators are slow....that the elevators are warm....It will always be something and frankly you would complain if you were given the room for free. If you are complaining about anything in your room, get a life. You are in Miami. Get out and see the beach and the nitelife!!!! Overall, great place, great hotel, great staff. The total package!! ! Review #38:overall, we are very happy with this hotel. We have a great room, spectacular view. However, we have sought a bit of relaxation in the lounge both nights we have been here. Both nights the same three staff members have been on duty. They seem to have no idea how to run a bar. The service is unbelievably slow. On both nghts we have waited for 20 minutes or more for our drinks. On both nights my husband has had to get up and deliver our orders directly to the bartender. The first night our food orders took forever and tonight I never got my slice of pie and our second round of drinks never arrived. We gave up, paid for the drinks we had and retreated to our comfortable room. We go out and we travel a lot - this service was just plain bizarre. Review #39:They are doing the best they can with the old building. If low ceilings bother you this is not the place for you. This hotel is best suited for the folks who want a decent place to stay when working in downtown Miami or are going to catch a cruise. We only picked it because we wanted a hotel that would give us the night we needed for our Hilton Honors points. That having been said that have updated the rooms and the corner Jr. Suite is very spacious, had a great view of the bay but lacked a microwave or a mini-refrigerator??? The bathroom was small as well. The pool area was actually a nice surprise as it was spacious and well furnished with a very friendly full service pool bar and grill. This is a very large hotel and very busy with many international guest (we overheard many languages spoken) and eventhough the staff was VERY busy they all had a great attitude and friendly demeanor. The overwhelming number of people just means that everything takes a little longer. I also did not care for the $28/ day parking fee. Im confident that given more time I could have found something more pleasing for the second half of our family vacation. Review #40:Our stay at the Hilton Downtown Miami was nothing short of perfect. The staff were very friendly from the moment we reached there to the moment we left. I have never come across such friendly staff! We arrived there after a very long flight from Ireland and we were delighted to have such a fast check in and such friendly service. Our room was very comfortable and had a amazing view of the city and of the bay. Definitely worth the money. The breakfast buffet was quiet nice. There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained. The hotel is close to everything. All you need to do is hop on the bus or metromover which is almost outside the door! So it is impossible to complain about that! There were always taxi's at the hotel also that could bring us on a five minute trip to the beach!! Fantastic hotel, keep it up! We will be back for sure. Thanks for a great stay!! ! Review #41:When we arrived for a one night stay, (we were catching a cruise ship the next morning) the one bell hop at the entrance did not greet us, or offer to help, or open a door. He seemed to be busy counting his tips. The young man at the check in desk was very helpful but was new, as he sounded so scripted as if he had memorised all his lines. The hotel is old and needs some updating in several areas. We had a snack in the lounge as that's all that was available. It was almost uneatable, but we were hungry. The next day they compt our snack after explaning it all to the front desk people. The Hilton Honors lounge had a very nice breakfast available but it seemed that the superivisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean tables, so was hard to find a clean one. The hotel is near the ski train that will take you right downtown for free. Watch out for the unfortuneates in our society. There is tansit police around but not everywhere. Review #42:My husband and friends stayed at the Hilton Miami Downtown for a week.We really enjoy this hotel.Our room was clean and comfortable.The pool is great if you enjoy swimming great drinks at the pool bar.Driveway staff was very friendley and polite. We had a great time.Parking is expensive. Review #43:My husband and I stayed at the Miami Hilton for a conference he was attending. Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive. For me, it's the little details that make a hotel worth the money, and the Hilton just doesn't have the attention to detail that a hotel of its caliber should. First, the toilet paper holder is 2.5 ft. away from the toilet - I kid you not. You almost fall off of the toilet trying to get it. Second, my husband and I are both businesspeople, and to get wireless internet in our room, we were EACH charged $9.99 a day, even though their materials all say \"wireless internet in your room for only $9.99 a day.\" What they should say is per computer. Maybe other hotels do this, too, but I haven't experienced it. I'm sleeping in the bed with my husband. Will I be charged extra for that? Third, the entire hotel is a little run down. I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab. Soon. Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is. Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours. Now, I don't expect Hilton to be able to control emergencies like this, but I mention it only as another point of frustration with this place. In a city like Miami, I'm sure there are better places to stay. Review #44:Stayed there for a business conference and have to say I was less than impressed. Everything was just about average. On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent. Due to on-site construction, elevator service was horrible. And a lot of construction in the \"motor lobby\" on the ground floor. Finally, despite the name, it's not really downtown per se, but a 5 minute drive from downtown. Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland. Review #45:We did a roundtrip in Florida and stayed here for two nights. Ask bayview and as high as possibele ! We has a great view over the bay (room 1416) The room was clean, large with a very comfortable bed. The sheets and pillows are excellent for a good night sleep. There is no fridge or in-room safe in the room. The bathroom is also really nice, here the towels smells like they should. We did valid parking (max 28 dollar a day), no problem checking in and out, they are fast. Also we tried the breakfast buffet, it was tastfull and complete (20 dollar p.p.) Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all. One of the best hotels during our holiday, if there is a next time, we book it again without any doubt . The location,down -town, was oke. There are just a few fast-food eateries near the entrance of the hotel. Things looked not so nice a few blocks further away, so we did not walked around the area. South beach is a 15 minutes drive. We also did some beaching on Key Biscane, loved it. Review #46:As we arrived we parked on the street, there was constructiono but being that we live on Sobe we knew the area and parking area well...so we avoided the $29 valet parking per day....We were greeted by Andrew, excellent front desk person who gave us a room on the high floor....I told him it was my birthday weekend and he tried to make it very special for me and my family...we then went to lobby to wait for room, excellent service also...The service at every place we went was superb...i even thought i wasn't in Miami...lol..everyone super friendly....the pool bartender also....In the executive lounge, service was great too...nothing to complaint....our room had a great view of the port and bayside also miami beach and the bed was amazing....... Review #47:I was on a weeklong business trip and attended a training program. The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun. Cab ride to South Beach was $15. Beds were very comfortble with excellent creature comforts, towels pillows and bedding and I felt that it was a very comfortable sleeping room. Wireless internet access is $9.95 which isn't bad by most comparisons. The banquet food was fabulous and themed menus were creative and well presented. I loved the shrimp and crab claws. Nice pool area for catching some sun or for a late night swim.. I had a great burger and beer at the lobby bar upon arrival and felt like the staff was very friendly in all departments. I would definitely go back. Great meeting space adn overall a well managed Hilton. Review #48:I visted this hotel on a Thursday with two other family members. Check in was quick and our bags were brought to the room in a timely manner. The lobby, restautant, bar and pool looked great at this hotel. The rooms and hallways left a little more to be desired. On the way to my room someone had dropped 3 beers on the floor and it was wet and sticky with the cans still there and a wet floor sign in the middle. After staying in Hilton's in Alabama and other states i was expecting more from the Hilton in Miami. The room's didnt look nearly as good as they did in other less known cities. No safe or frig in the rooms. The staff was great. They only give 2 free continental breakfast coupons no matter how many people you book in the room. I didnt like the looks of the free continental breakfast so I ordered room service and it was tasty and arrived quickly. Checkout was quick. I would still stay again now that I know what to expect. Review #49:I was not looking forward to staying at this hotel after reading the bad reviews ,but i have to say that we really enjoyed our two night stay. The room was really clean, the hotel facilities were very good and the views from the room were amazing, we could not fault the service and the breakfast, everything was presented well. I would have to say don't be put off by the bad reviews about the hotel. The only downfall is that the hotel could have been in a better area. Also there are safes available at this hotel at the reception which are free of charge! Review #50:After 4 days at Walt Disney World followed by 4 days cruising from Miami to Key West to Cozumel and back to Miami, we wanted a great place to relax. We found that here. The room was wonderful and they actually had one unexpectedly ready for us to check-in at 9:30 a.m., well before their 3 p.m. check-in time. All was fresh & clean, and the view of the bay was an added perk. Every staff person we encountered was friendly & helpful. Review #51:Stayed 1 night at this Hotel (prior to cruise embarkation the next day). Hotel location is away from the main tourist attractions (Bayside Marketplace, Miami beaches). There are hardly any shops nearby except for a fast-food outlet opposite the hotel. The room was large, clean and quiet. Bed was comfortable. Great view of the port from my room. Free wifi only at the lobby and not in room. Most guests are in T-shirt, shorts and slippers (We are in Miami!) so the feel/atmosphere is different from other Hilton (business) hotel. Review #52:I stayed here when I went to visit U of M. I got a great deal online! The hotel is very clean, the staff professional - and the food - simply amazing. Although - taking a tip from a previous poster - dine at the Bistro - 1/2 price on some of the appetizers and reasonably priced sandwiches. What I got was beyond what I expected - I was stuffed to the brim. The room was immaculate (although the hair dryer had a broken attachment). If you can get a good deal...I say go for it. If you're visiting the med school, it's supposedly only 2.5 miles away - but it took me nearly half an hour to deal with the miami traffic - so either familiarize yourself the night before OR leave early enough to address the bumper to bumper traffic. BE WARNED though - self-park is 25 per day in the garage (or pay everytime you pull it out of the garage); valet park is 28 per day (can pull it out as often as you want). Rates are valid as of this posting. Review #53:I was here for one night with my family before we board a cruise ship across the bay. I was hhonors gold member so my room was upgraded to a bayview on high floor with access to lounge. Nothing to complain. The room is a big corner room with a balcony as big as the room itself :P floor to ceiling window provide great view and bright natrual light. As I was only there for one night I didn't utility all the services the hotel had to offer. Just used the lounge for snack in the early evening and breakfast the next morning. The lady at the nice enough to give my daughter an OJ even though it wasn't normally offered for snacks and only for breakfast. Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs. There was one little bump in my stay, my room is a connecting room with the other side also occupied. The neighbor was a bit loud in the music playing but it goes with the connecting room so I can't really complain too much. Then I smelled cigarette smoke leaking through the connecting door. The smell gets stronger and stronger and I have a preganent wife and a small child so I called front desk and confirmed the hotel is a 100% smoke-free hotel and told them about the smoke. The manager was quick to investigate with security staff. Minutes later, the manager is back at my door and told me they have resolved the issue with my next door neighbor and asked me if wanted to switch room. It was late in the night so I thanked him and said I can just open the big sliding door to the balcony to air out the room. Overall, it was a very nice stay with excellent services. Review #54:My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes! When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents. We got an upgrade when checked in to a better view room, bay/city view which was gorgeous, specially at night! The kids wanted to go the pool, so went there and had some really good sandwiches and the pool was clean and not so many people at all. The executive lounge is in the 16th floor (also a great view!) and there we met Luis who was very friendly and polite, always smiling and as it was our first time in miami he kindly answer ALL of our questions. We also wanted to go out for dinner(the snacks in the lounge weren't enough for the kids)so he recommended a very good restaurant near the bay area and he even called there and made us a reservation so we didn't have to wait for the line. Everytime we ran into someone they always saluted us. I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place. I would go and would stay again without any doubts. Review #55:This hotel and the staff were great. The renovations that I have been reading about appear to be just about complete. The rooms were GREAT! All five of them. Updated, clean, and very comfortable beds. One of the rooms air conditioning did not work and the front desk gave a rebate for that room which was nice. After working 15 years in the hotel business I know that perfection isnt always possible thus I appreciate it when hotel staff goes the extra mile. For example, I was told by the front desk that I needed to go down to the transportation office in order to book the shuttle to the cruise terminal. When I got downstairs to the motor lobby there was no one at the transportation office. The bell captain noticed I looked confused and asked me what I needed. I told him I needed a shuttle to the cruise terminal for 12 people for 11AM the next morning. He told me that no one was at the transportation office but he took my room number and told me he would have a shuttle for me at the time requested. Just based on prior experience I thought that the next morning we would be scrambling for cabs so I got downstairs a little early. The Bell Captain recognixed me as I got off the elevator, got all of our luggage together and got us oon our way in our shuttle. I the hotel business sometimes the HOSPITALITY piece is forgotten. Not so at the Hilton Miami Downtown. The service was the best!! Also the fitmess center was really excellent. As was the resturant. We had lunch one day and breakfast another Review #56:I'm a hhonors Diamond member. Was pre-assigned room number 1630 a large corner room with its own huge private terrace. The floor to ceiling windows and the private terrace made for spectacular views of downtown Miami as well as the cruise port. The staff were all pleasant and helpful, especially Bell services that made several dining recommendations. There's a Tapas bar on the other side of the street about a block to your right. The pool is on the roof just off of the lobby, with a large selection of loungers as well as couples loungers with cushions. The executive lounge had new Dell computers, wifi internet access was available throughout the hotel (including the pool area) -- free for gold and diamond members. Would definitely recommend for a pre/post cruise stay. Great treatment of hhonors members. Review #57:We stayed at the Hilton for 2 nights after getting of a cruise. The hotel itself was pretty good. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the lobby and bars downstairs were very relaxing and we did spend alot of time there. The room was spacious, but the walls very thin. We were near the lifts and they were noisy all night. The airconditioning in the room was rather loud as well. But the room was clean and bright. Except for the location, we would stay there again. When we travel, we like to walk around the area/city and enjoy the sights. DO NOT walk too far from this Hotel. We should have stayed at South Beach area instead. Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel. We soon turned around, went back and called a taxi to take us where we wanted to go. The Hotel is good - the location is not. Review #58:Great Hotel perfect location, although there was a lot of construction around the hotel. Parking is super expensive, but that's Miami for you, at $28 per day. Be careful when you check in make sure they put you in the room you actually reserved. Beautiful lobby! ! Review #59:Only the view from the hotel room made it worthwhile for me. I had a corner room with views from two sides of the room. I had expected a minibar in a hotel of this category. The location is not that good for the regular tourist with no car but a Metromover station is nearby. It can take you to the Bayside Marketplace where you find nice restaurants and shops. However, if I will ever visit Miami again, I will book a hotel in the Art Deco District. Review #60:We decided to stay at Hilton dowtown after a terrible experience in South Beach, at \"Suites on South Beach\". Weather was terrible, never so cold in Miami since 1930. We had a wonderful room at 20th floor with 2 walls of windows, overlooking the city. There was a problem with heating system, but it seems it was the first time ever they need it... Anyway the staff had been wonderful and tried immediatly to fix it. Valet parking was very pricy ($ 28) but very efficient. Internet connection free in the lobby, pricy in the rooms, breakfast not included. Nice swimming pool, even if not tried having 32\u00c2\u00b0F. The hotel formerly was a Radisson and the struistoric Hilton are better. Heating quite noisy. Anyway if you have a car it takes 3 minutes to go to South Beach and it is better spend money for a good hotel in downtown compared to a fake design hotel in SOBE. Try taptap haitian restaurant for dinner, wonderful. Review #61:We booked via web and got a fair price last fall. The location is pretty much good. It takes 5-10 minutes to oceans drive with cab or car. At first they took us to an unready room which was disappointing but after a short wait they took us to a really big room with a great harbor scene as an apology to the mess. The rooms are pretty new or renovated recently . Bathroom is clean and wide. The beds are comfortable and big. The breakfast buffet wasn't included in the price but we enjoyed continental breakfast. The rooms have fast internet access even internet tv but we didn't have time to use. The staff were pretty friendly and warm especially the bellboys and front desk officials. \u00c4\u00b1t has an interesting entrance you take a lift to 3 floor above to enter the lobby from the valet service but still not tiring. As a matter of fact if you want to spend a few days in central Miami I say go for it. Review #62:I am a frequent traveler to Miami and I have stayed at different hotels every time. I stayed two nights in a room with two beds and floor to ceiling windows with a beautiful view of the city. We had difficulty with the TV the first night and called the front desk. Someone was at our door within 5 minutes. He was knowleable regarding the TV and needed to make severeal setting changes and everything was working perfect. I must say my most recent experience at this Hotel has really blown me away. Front desk staff very courteous and professional. I also had great meals in the restuarant with good quality and service delivered by the staff. I plan to stay hotel in my future visits to Miami. The staff is extremely nice and always finding ways to go the extra mile... I received a discount for parking for my conference and paid only $12 dollars for two nights. Review #63:Not right in South Beach, but this hotel still has a very good location near the Biscayne Bay with beautiful views! See if you can get upgraded to a higher floor room, the view is really spectacular! Close to a mall and generally well situated if you are in Miami for business. Review #64:I stayed here for a 4 day conference. Construction was happening on the exterior of the hotel. The staff here were more than excellent. My colleague and I both received excellent service. The breakfast buffet is expensive but worth it. Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water were offered once one exists the elevator in the morning into the lobby. Room was clean, comfortable beds, with excellent view of the bay and downtown. The OMNI trainstation was only a block away. Taking the train toward downtown is free and a five minute ride to the famous Bayside Marketplace --- which is a must do! Overall, was a great stay :) Review #65:You may stayed at other modern hotels around the world and you will find it this hotel is a little bit dated. However, I still think this hotel is very nice with the size of the room, lobby area, swimming pool and the gym. We stayed for 2 nights before we board on the cruise ship. Taxi brought us to South Beach and the terminals within 15mins and there will always be taxi. Hotel stuff are very helpful. Room is very clean overall. A little bit pricy but you are staying at Hilton, so you expected to pay a bit more. Review #66:Two friends and I (three young women) stayed at this hotel during June of this Summer. During our stay we were sexually harassed by the security guard on duty by the pool. Not only did the three of us feel unsafe but we were scared to stay in the room for fear the guard might have access to our room. The next day after I arrived back in Atlanta, I contacted the hotel and left a message for the manger stating that it was about sexual harassment at the hotel...I never received a call back. So then I contacted Corporate offices, and I was informed that the manager already stated that he sent a apology to me (LIES). The manger (Mr. Pellon) of the hotel did not give an apology, he just said he did to cover his own tracks. I had to chase down an apology. I JUSTreceived an apology on October 3, 2011. I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami. If this harassment has happen to you at this hotel also, please contact me because my attorney will be more than happy to take your case also. Review #67:I liked the comfort of the beds, the flow of water in the shower, and the helpfulness of the staff, but that is pretty much it. Aside from the convenient location to the MetroMover, which was all we needed to get to the bayside station. The hotel needs to seriously upgrade its rooms to be in par with other establishments. It lacks a new television sets. Switching between channels was quite dreadful; the volume was vastly different for every other station. The room was a bit dusty and the coffee station did not have stir sticks. In addition, it did not enough tea bags for two people. With the absents of bath towels in our room, especially after haven already taking a shower, made the experience of drying off a difficult challenge. The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in. We witnessed an arrest by hotel security staff after a man refused to leave the motor lobby. Btw, when you arrive at the hotel, it is quite confusing where the check in is located (2nd floor). In this case, I would suggest more signage for those arriving at the hotel. Review #68:I stayed here one night on business, enjoying the $89/night rate they were advertising on their web site. I would call this a four star hotel that's slightly rough around the edges. Tropical theme, colorful decor. All the staff members I encountered were more than friendly and attentive. Really, very hospitable. My first room was a bit noisy as it was across the hall from the vending machine, so they moved me, gladly, to the 18th floor. And they sent someone up to move me and didn't make me haul my luggage all the way downstairs again. Nice touch. The pool was fine, relaxing for downtown location. I had dinner outside in the nice Miami breeze. The ceviche was terrific. But the wines by the glass selections could be a bit more varied. Kendall Jackson and BV were about it. For such an international city I thought there would be more attention paid to international wines, but that's my thing so... Overall, nice place to stay if you are in town on business. Review #69:I stayed here for a short break with a corporate rate which was able to jump to a bay view suite. Rooms have a good area and all you need on a Hilton. nearby the Bayside arena and a short drive to Miami Beach (art Deco). The only drawback is that near by the hotel you do not have any life, and the park option is expensive 28 usd. Review #70:The Downtown Miami Hilton is on the fringe of the downtown area but very close to the light rail and a short drive to S. Beach and Little Havana. Rooms are very spacious and modern with large Windows and expansive views. All in all a nice hotel. If you like dancing try The Vagabond nightclub within walking distance. Review #71:Nice hotel no real complaints. Thanks to Anthony at the front desk who managed to get us a room with a great view for my partners birthday. Nice bar and restaurant downstairs, great pool and views. The drinks and food are pricey in the hotel, but then again in Miami everything seems to be expensive. There are fast food places to eat right across the street, you would have to drive a few blocks for a good place to eat. Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend. Close to all - short taxi ride away. I would not recommend strolling at night in the area, during the day very busy and walkable. I would definitly stay again, and it was a great experience overall. One more note parking is 28 per day, and internet 10 bucks for 24 hrs - again something expected in a downtown major city ..no real place to park otherwise, so this may be the only option, or cab it.. Review #72:Stayed here for 2 nights in Sept 2008, on our way down to Key West. Got a great deal on the room through priceline. Room was great, very large corner room, nice flat panel TV, fridge, the 2 outer walls were basically floor to ceiling windows with amazing views. Service was good, nothing to complain about. Hotel is clean and nicely decorated. Now the things that ticked us off, and I know some of this isn't the fault of the hotel. When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore. To further my aggravation, the hotel information stated that a continental breakfast buffet was included, however when we went down the dining area and got the kids some food and sat down to eat is when we were informed that the breakfast was not included, since we were already sitting and eating it was a little too late to get up and leave, add another $60 to the bill and my deal is now no deal. I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else. I know that the hotel had recently changed ownership but they should have had the hotel information changed with the various booking agents. Review #73:only a few days ago, I was at the first time in miami also at the first time in this hotel and I'm impressed! Everything there were great from the nice clean and comfortable room with the unbelievable pretty view until the good food, the great bar and pool etc and last but not least the helpful friendly and sympathetic staff especially the ladjh in the little shop and the men called fernando at the front desk, he'd done a well work, gave good advices and was very cordially,smart, professional with a nice charisma and left behind a positive impression! so I would like to say thx to all staff and especiall to fernando for this great service, that's one of the reason why we will come again soon... it was the first and definitely not the last time. I only could recommend a stay in this wonderful hotel to everybody Review #74:Traveled to Miami in January for business and stayed at the Hilton Downtown because the conference was being held at the same hotel. The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it. $28/day for valet and $25/day self parking...very expensive Blood stains on pillow cases...contacted front desk about the issue and they reacted like it was a normal thing and would mention it to housekeeping. Room was very sub-standard for cleanliness...floor looked like it never gets vacuumed. Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business. For the money, there are much better hotels in the area. The cost of this hotel should be 1/2 of existing for the value. Review #75:the hilton hotel downtown miami has the most amazing roof top pool and terrace.with stunning views over the port and miami.staff really helpful,and the rooms spacious clean and beds you just sink into.food and drink what you would expect to pay in city.pricey on overnight parking 28 dollars.but what a view of fireworks on new year.aesy to find and ideal if going on a cruise from miami port,only 5 mins drive.would recomend. Review #76:The reviews for the hotel were terrible. I had wanted to cancel and stay somewhere else before my cruise. But I'm happy to say the Miami Hilton met all my needs. Check in was smooth and courteous except after waiting 20 min for an elevator my keys did not work and I was on a high floor. Got a new one and all was fine. I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet. The pool was outstanding and service very good there. I also enjoyed the Lounge and food there. I will stay at this very busy hotel again. Review #77:Fridge didnt work Staff was rude and all spanish speaking. Staff lied that the bus system of Miami was very difficult to use when in fact it was more inexpensive and a lot easier than getting around w/ a taxi. Room was small and boring. Pool sucked Cooling system was messed up (we could not control it) We stayed there 5 days and really got tired of it! Review #78:I stay at hundreds of hotels per year for work. I have a difficult time sleeping at night so requested a room away from the elevator. I reconfirmed this request prior to arrival. However, when I arrived my room as well as my mothers room who is also a very light sleeper is next to an elevator. The staff were unhelpful. I spoke to several managers including Humberto several times. After a very poor nights sleep he offered to refund the points for the rooms. I accepted since the only reason I stayed at this Hilton was for a good nights sleep while starting a family vacation. The elevator dinged all night long keeping up the entire family. While the offer of refunding the points was nice, it would have actually been netter if they followed though on that promise!. After several e-mails they responded they were only refunding a single room. I also copied the Hilton executive team and did not receive a response form them. I will be not be staying at this hotel again and if you want a good nights sleep at a hotel with a friendly staff I recommend you don't either. Review #79:I attended a conference at this hotel for 2 days. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. Guestroom was spacious and the bed was so nice, it was difficult to get up in the morning! Food during the meeting was very good. No missed wake up calls! Review #80:Just stayed here for business. I must say my first impressions were not good, but the hotel staff made efforts to improve my stay. Got in late and check in was a nightmare. Really have never been through a slower check in - problem was that I was behind about 25 foreign tourists, which is what appears to make up the majority of this hotel's clientel. After finally being checked in I was given a room that had some problems. Had to move rooms, but was upgraded to a suite and my room service was comped. Very nicely handled by front desk staff. Other than that all was well, staff was friendly. Cons: hotel loud, construction going on outside, Internet is not free. Pros: friendly staff, clean rooms Review #81:Stayed one night on way to cruise. Booked a 2 queen bed junior suite for 5 people. The 2 queen beds were NOT queen size. They were at most double beds. The room was very large and had a pull-out sofa. But, there were no sheets available and we had to call down to housekeeping at 2am (when we arrived) to get sheets. The poor gentleman who arrived with our sheets had NO idea how to make a bed, he started putting the blanket on the mattress (before the sheets) when I told him he could leave. The room did have windows on 3 sides and a great view. As a Hilton gold member, we went to the concierge level for the continental breakfast. It was NOT good. Extremely runny, undercooked scrambled eggs, bacon, cheap bagels, yogurt, some cereal. I have had much better free continental breakfasts at Holiday Inns. And if you think the reviews about the elevators are exaggerated, they are not. The elevator can take 20-30 minutes to get to your floor and is often filled with people and luggage. We tried to take the stairs, but there is no direct route to the lobby and ended up on a wild goose chase around the building. Ended up riding up and back down to get to the lobby. This was just an OK place to stay for 1 night. Review #82:This is the 3rd time I stay in this hotel, due to very busy schedule I made all my meetins in the hotel. Wish to point out the excellent service I and my guests have enjoyed in the dining room from the manager in charge Mr Avi Zarchi and his team. Very polite and very professional approach. Wish I could meet same people in other hotels I stay around the world. Zary Rosenfeld Room 1125 IN 3/12 out 3/16/2012 Review #83:Check in was very nice, after being in the room for sometime, my elderly mother in law reached under the pillow to discover a used \" prophylactic\" . Housekeeping came up and changed out the sheets, but the vision never went away. Upon inspecting our room, my wife found used empty shampoo bottles in the shower. The next morning the hotel manager was \"unavailable\" to speak to us, but the gentleman at the counter said he would \" refund our money \" from the cruise package to us. As of today, we have not heard anything from the hotel or the cruise line to confirm this. Other than that, the hotel is very nice. I feel the housekeeping staff is totaly at fault, and needs better supervision. Review #84:Stayed one night before boarding a cruise ship. As a Hilton gold member, had access to the lounge, and free internet in room. Luckily, due to the fact that internet access is pricey otherwise. Lounge lacked bottles of water! Only option for a hot meal for breakfast was scrambled eggs and bacon; no oatmeal at this location, which I was looking forward to. The toaster was broken as well, with burned out elements. Other food in the lounge was good (fruit, coffee). When we arrived, only option for a meal was at the bar in the lobby. Horrible club sandwich! Cold fat soaked bacon, processed meats, and very expensive. Plus, they tack on an 18% service fee with the meal - 2 drinks and 2 sandwiches came to $64!! Recommendation: eat elsewhere; even room service would probably have been better. Review #85:I normally stay in South Beach when I go to Miami, but this time I stayed at the Hilton in Downtown Miami. We got a Bayview room and it came with incredible views of the Miami Skyline. The staff was always friendly and helpful. I even asked a random employee about towels poolside & he was more than happy to help even though it's not technically his job. The only downside is that it is a bit of a hassle to get to the beach compared to staying in South Beach, but I already knew that going into the stay. I also liked that they were dog friendly. I took my Pekingese with me and she loved the beds (slept comfortably) and the floor to ceiling windows. Review #86:Booked over the net (hotels.com)from Australia for a 4 night stay prior to a cruise from Ft Lauderdale. King double requested with views to south or east as well as breakfast and carparking $200 / night. Got a 4th floor room with canyon views. No breakfast or carparking. Location was great 200 yds from Omni station for free Metro Mover + local bus station ($2 one way anywhere on route). $25 taxi from Miami airport. Rooms large and clean. No room safe or fridge - ice down the hall. Paid for newspapers - got 2 out of 4. They just said they ran out. Once coffee machine was used it was not replenished, even after a request to staff. Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service. Room service trays stayed in corridors for 2 days. Review #87:We stayed here Saturday night before the ING Miami Marathon/ Half Marathon. The entrance is funky if you arrive by car and expect to park in the garage. You drive up to what seems to be the 3-4 floor and there is a nice entrance. But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking. We finally got to the lobby and due to the many marathon guests, it was busy. I waited in the Hilton Honors line, which was shorter than the other line. After about 5 minutes, I was helped. Front desk staffer was very nice, saw that I was a Hilton Honors Gold member and quickly informed me of the complimentary welcome reception and breakfast at the executive lounge. He also noted that I requested a room by an ice machine and replied that he was sorry but they did not have any rooms left. He then upgraded me to a one-bedroom suite. When we got up there we realized it was actually two separate rooms with a connecting door, one with a dining and sitting area, bathroom, and a gorgeous view of downtown Miami. The other room was a regular guest room which was a good size and had a comfortable bed. And yes, we were now near an ice machine. The upgrade was very much appreciated. We did not make the breakfast because of the race timing, but the welcome reception was very nice. The executive lounge also had a nice view and offered hot and cold appetizers, water and soft drinks, along with wine and beer for a reasonable price. Very nice feature. I used to live right next to this hotel and was very impressed with the service and the accommodations. This hotel can often be had for a deal and would be a great value. Location is walkable to the Arsht Center, American Airlines Arena, and Bayside, but you would need a taxi/car for anything else. Review #88:This hotel lived up to its name and expectations! VERY clean and tidy The staff was great, courteous, and friendly. Our room had a great view of the city. The restaurant on the main level was excellent, had a variety of food and drinks. We had a small group and received a decent price for the weekend. The central fire station is located a few blocks down from this hotel. The valet was efficient and always had our car available when we exited the elevator. Review #89:Spent 6 days here for a conference and workshop. Overall really happy with the place. Would honestly give 3.5 but 3 is a bit low. Location is decent- fairly close to real downtown, very close to bus and train terminal for south beach etc. But not much in walking range. Conference setup is typical but decent. Wifi struggles at times, nerd heavy conferences will be rough. Food: seriously excellent snapper, bomb key lime pie. Again conference food just ok though, damn those $16 DOJ muffins Rooms a are good, big tvs, comfy beds, nice setup. Staff were real helpful and friendly, no faults there. Some fun decor and some oldish. Overall really happy with our stay, apart from one crappy bathroom light switch that took all your body weight to activate... Review #90:I had to spend my last night in Miami, and in Downtown I found this Hilto more convenient than the Hyatt, where I spent a couple of nights ten days before. The parking was just fine: as i already wrote just pick the valet service because a) you don't want to look for a parking in this neighborhood and b) the difference between valet and single entry is risible. The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach. Absolutely nothing to complain about rooms (modern and with huge widescreen tv) and service: the express check out on the phone, in a busy day of meeting and conferences, saved me a lot of time. In downtown Miami I would probably come back here. Review #91:We found the hotel faultless, really clean, excellent service and really good value for money! Loved Angelina who served us every night in the lounge bar! Our only gripe was the area... We live in the NE of England so are used to a bit of rough and tumble but upon leaving the hotel each time we felt really uneasy!!! Too many hobos and drug addicts!!! ! Review #92:Stay here if you enjoy sleeping with loud music. We had very loud booming music until 1:00am, not easy to fall asleep with that going on. $28 for valet parking, really???? I hate being fleeced for parking and this seems to be a trend in Miami. No bar fridge in the room if you want to keep something cold. Not impressed. Review #93:Excellent services clean and spacious rooms with great view of downtown Miami.Bar off lobby is a great hotel bar.We were given a bottle of champagne for our anniversary.The staff was very accommodating always smiling and engaging in conversation. We are looking forward to returning.We highly recommend this Hilton. Review #94:Stayed at this hotel 2 different occasions both times the old men secuirty guards constantly harrass woman. I have seen them taking pictures of and with several females no wonder prostitues hang around there. They do nothing but assist in the situation. They ask for your business card and e-mail address it doesn't matter if you are from out of town or not. They are pigs! Review #95:We stayed at the Hilton Miami Downtown hotel for 2 nights before joining a cruise and were very happy with the hotel. The room was spacious and bathroom clean with great views over the bay and the breakfast was awesome, the staff throughout the hotel were very polite and helpful. The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach. It did seem that it was full of business people and a couple of seminars taking place but this meant the bar was lively on the evening and the pool area was very quiet during the day so we could soak up the sun with just a couple of other people around :) Overall I would definately recommend this hotel and also stay again if we return to Miami Review #96:Regular Miami traveller here. First time for the Hilton Downtown. The hotel room is well-appointed, clean, and contains the new amenities at Hilton - Lavazza in-room coffee, thick towels, and comfortable bedding. The A/C, as mentioned elsewhere here, is very loud. Can't hear the old-style TV (?) when it comes on. The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown. I wouldn't venture by foot very far here after dark - not there's much around. There is a couple of small restaurants two blocks north on Biscayne worth a try: Bin 18 and a Sushi bar. Pretty safe if you stay on Biscayne. Also a salad place and sandwich shop just past 19th St (hotel is on 16th). Have not tried the hotel offerings yet. Parking is absurd. $28 in this economy?? You have to be kidding! Indoor Park a block and a half away just off 2nd Ave and 14th St. on your left. You'll see the signs - much, much less expensive. All in all, not bad if you can figure out the parking. Compares well to the Hyatt in the room, although the Hyatt personal service is superior. Review #97:Stayed 1 night at this hotel as my wife and I prepared to fly out to the Caribbean the next day for an extended vacation. Check-in was easy, though its a little funky getting to the reception area as you have to take an elevator up a floor, but not a big deal. Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night. Room had a great city-view, it was clean, and everything worked properly. We wanted some firmer pillows and they brought them right up. They also gave us concierge access so a continental breakfast was available to us the next morning (not sure if it offered to everyone or to us because we were Hilton Honors members). Breakfast was typical continental, but good. We hung out by pool for a little bit in the morning as well, there were plenty of lounge chairs and pool was clean. They also had a business center with free internet access for guests, so we were able to check our flight info, which was a big help. Great value for the money we spent and not that far from airport. We'd stay there again w/o a 2nd thought. Review #98:Stayed at Miami Hilton for New Years Eve 2011. Great view was the only good thing at this hotel. Rates were too expensive and service was terrible. 4 persons stayed in room but only towels for 3 people. called hotel reception 3 times and no towels were ever delivered. not a good way to start New Years eve having to share towels. Air conditioning noise is horrendous. kept you awake all night. Phone did not work in room. WIFI is not free either. Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either. Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families. Review #99:We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton. When we arrived the valet guys seemed like they had nothing better to do than harass us. We checked in and later that night I wanted to have a bath. To my surprise, tge tub filled with green water. We called the front desk and they sent someone up to check. The guy who came said it was the city's problem and left. The manager called and said the water was safe and we explained we did not feel comfortable bathing and brushing our teeth in green water. We asked him for another room and to check it first. We waited an hour and got impatient because it was midnight. We called and they said they had one room but the water was green too. We asked for a discount or something and he said he would drop off some breakfast vouchers. We woke up to no vouchers under our door and had to call and explain a couple more times the situation. What an ordeal. They gave us continental vouchers. What an insult. We confronted them and they gave us a full breakfast. The breakfast was actually the highlight but the service at this hotel was disorganized and rude! !", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

My husband was traveling for business (making the cost of the hotel less of an issue), while I went sight-seeing. We were generally very happy with the Grand Amsterdam. The room was adequate in size, and nicely appointed. The bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms are well appointed, with nice toiletries and a good shower. I did wish for a double-sink, but those seem to be less common outside the U.S. (I'm not sure who thought up the rectangular toilet seat - very cute, but doesn't fit the round shape of the object sitting on it). We ate at the restaurant and found it very good, if pricey. We also used the gym - it has only three pieces of cardio equipment and one weight machine, but they were all in good condition. We used the pool and sauna - nice options after a day of touring. The hotel is very well located. We don't mind a little walking and only used a cab to take us to the train station when we left. There of lots of shops, restuarants, and attractions very nearby, and the Anne Frank House and Van Gogh Museum are an easy 20 minute walk. One note if you are traveling soon - ask about the ongoing construction or plan to be up by 8:00 a.m. sharp - the pounding on the building is noticable. Review #1:This is a truly great hotel. The decor is really cool, the beds are superbly comfortable, the bathrooms excellent, the food is wonderful. But what makes a great hotel is the staff. I've stayed here twice this year. The first time I was really busy with work and was working at the business centre even after I'd checked out. One of the staff noticed that I'd been beavering away at my laptop for quite a long and asked whether she could bring me a drink. She then brought me a beautiful pot of tea (and I do mean the teapot was very beautiful, but it was also a very touching gesture). When I returned more recently, the person checking me in mentioned that on the previous visit I'd had a problem with room service (it was simply that because I was working I wanted to have dinner in my room and there did not seem to be a room service menu in the room, when I rang room service, one was delivered to my room very promptly) and that problem had been addressed and there were now room service menus in the room. That is really impressive service and excellent follow up by the staff. As much as I love Amsterdam, I will return simply to stay at the Grand. Review #2:Great hotel, fabulous, courteous helpful staff and Guido the concierge among the best ever! Convenient central location, excellent restaurants. Beautiful building and rooms, immaculate, comfortable - Wow!! Only negative was that like most nicer European hotels, they expect you to eat a large and very expensive breakfast buffet. A la carte only available via room service. Great guest lounge on main floor with 2 complimentary computers (and free internet) for guest use was a nice plus. Review #3:We stayed at this hotel for two nights, as my 40th birthday was on the 29th December. We had complimentary champagne upon arrival. The location is perfect for exploring beautiful Amsterdam and the staff were extremely helpful. We used the spa which was relaxing and therapeutic. We enjoyed champagne with the staff on the Thursday evening and tried some delicious cheese! Our room was comfy and was regularly tidied and freshened up. It was a birthday that I will always remember and I would love to return one day. Amsterdam is a fantastic and architecturally wonderful city. Review #4:Checked in to the hotel on Thursday, greeted by a host and a lovely Butler Domingo! We were celebrating our anniversary and were treated like a prince and princess! our luggage was misplaced so stress levels were up, but the butler chased this up regularly! We had a suite room which was outstanding with views of the canal, The bathroom was lovely, and the bedroom so romantic! Lovely size bed! Loved everything about the stay, hotel is a walk way from all the shops/rest and the staff are all so pleasant! We even got treated like VIP at the restaurant Domingo booked for us where we got a special table too! Loved it, want to do it al again! Thank you for the amazing stay! Review #5:Sofitel's renowned service in addition to Dutch hospitality have made our stay at this hotel a wonderful experience. The contrast of modern furnishing in a historical building dating back to the 1500s makes this hotel ideal for a romantic getaway. The guest relations manager greeted us from the lobby and escorted us to the room. The entire staff were eager to please us. The guest-staff get together on thursdays with flowing champagne glasses and finger foods is just one example of the warmth and hospitality you'll expect. Dam square is right across the corner and the red light district is a five minute walk away, making its location ideal regardless of what your idea of fun is. The beds were extremely comfortable and the view of the canal from the room was just perfect. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone and I would definitely stay there if I ever go to Amsterdam again. Review #6:We stayed at The Grand Sofitel in Amsterdam on the nights of June 4, 5 and 6 in suite 336. Two other couples in our traveling party also stayed at The Grand on the same nights at our recommendation. WE ALL HAD A VERY ENJOYABLE STAY. From my first contact with Sanne Pisters in reservations to the last contact with the concierge as we all left for the airport our stay WAS PERFECT. You have a wonderful property. I own the Ocean Lodge and The Lodges at Cannon Beach in Cannon Beach, Oregon a beachside town located 90 minutes west of Portland Oregon so I know good service when I see it. Your rooms were clean and well appointed. Everything worked properly and was explained by the valet. Your morning breakfast buffet was very complete including the hot entrees we ordered after getting fruit and pastry. The Grand is a wonderful spot to stay because it is central to all of the activities we planned. Once day four in our group went to the train station and rented bikes to ride the dikes across the river, two others walked to the Zoo. Others went to the Anne Frank House, on canal tours and to museums. At the end of each day we met back at The Grand for a quiet moment of respite. We enjoyed two late evenings outside in the terrace bar and one room service when one of our party twisted a knee and needed a night off from walking. Your concierge selected perfect places for us to eat where they clearly knew we were Sofitel guests. Each night we had a nice hot shower and then fell asleep in the wonderful beds - ready for a new day, All of your employees made us feel at home and we will be returning to The Grand when we take a cruise from Amsterdam to Basel, Switzerland. Review #7:We stayed at Sofitel The Grand Amsterdam for 2 nights in early Dec 2008. We took a Connexxion hotel shuttle from the Schiphol airport, and the trip took about 25-30 minutes (with a few other hotel drop-offs). When we tried to check-in at Sofitel, we were told that our booking was not available. We then figured that we were at the wrong hotel (i.e. Sofitel but not Sofitel The Grand)! Fortunately the Connexxion driver was still outside the hotel, and he gave us a ride to the right place. So make sure you communicate the correct hotel name to your driver if you're going to stay there. The hotel itself was a historic and magnificent site. We stayed in a Sofitel suite with courtyard view. The room was huge with a large bed and lounge area, a separate room with closets and a working desk, and a bathroom. The decor and furniture looked a bit old-fashioned at first (e.g. colorful / patterned draperies, tapestry sofa, oak table, etc. ), but we actually quite liked them after a while as the ambience was cozy and very different from other contemporary / modern hotels we had previously stayed in. The most important thing was we felt comfortable in the suite. The courtyard (from our window) was nice - would be relaxing to have a walk around there. However, as the weather was rather cold and rainy, we did not spend time out there during our stay. The hotel offered turn-down service in the early evening. Some people might not like it but we were fine and appreciated it. We also enjoyed a complimentary welcome drink at the restaurant. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We bought our tickets to the Van Gogh Museum at the reception / concierge (to avoid line-up at the museum). A hotel staff also recommended a great Indonesian restaurant to us (can't remember the name now...but I did take one of their cards). To sum it up, we were happy with our stay and would certainly go back next time we're in Amsterdam. Review #8:We had the pleasure of staying at the Sofitel Grand Amsterdam and can say it was one of the best hotel stays we have ever experienced. Once you enter the grounds of the hotel, the crazy outside world just disappears.... The hotel itself is stunning. On check in you are shown to your room and the features of the room & hotel are explained to you. The compliementary dried fruits & syrup biscuits are a lovely touch. The nespresso coffee machine was also appreciated! The central courtyard of the hotel is a oasis, the perfect place to enjoy a glass of champagne. We had dinner at the restaurant, the menu is fish based and we completely enjoy both the food and the amibence. All the staff we spoke with were outstanding. The staff are extremely friendly yet professional, a perfect balance. We can not reccommend a stay a this Grand Hotel strongly enough!! ! Review #9:Very poor in every respect, bar closed early, barman had to look up how to make a cocktail, cold water in the shower, TV that didn't work - (I could do on). If you take advantage of one of the special offers you can expect a second rate service, a noisey room and staff who really don't want you to return. Review #10:This is a great value,the staff are warm and welcoming,the rooms are wonderfully well-equipped,the breakfast is excellent,the location is perfect and the whole hotel is spotless. Everything was great, they had free wifi,a balcony,laundry service,breakfast included,and they were happy to help with whatever we needed.The hotel itself was very clean & comfortable. Review #11:My husband and I stayed for three nights in August and our overall impressions of the hotel were extremely favourable from the excellent location and impressive decor to the cleanliness of the room. Our only gripe was with the service, both in the bar and the restaurant when we had breakfast. It was painfully slow, and the waiting staff suffered from tunnel vision, ignoring our attempts to catch their attention. Someone needs to do a time and motion exercise to improve things - why have waitresses standing around doing nothing because (presumably) it is not in their remit to, for example, take your order but instead just to clear tables? That irritation aside, tho, I would not hesitate to stay at the hotel again. Review #12:The beds at The Grand are actually like sleeping on cloud. As a couple who sleep on a Tempurpedic in the US, this bed is ten times more comfortable. Incredible sleeping on this lovely feather bed with a feather duvet. The service is impeccable and I'm sure they would cheerfully scrape gum off the sole of my shoe had I asked. Every detail was attended to and the turn-down service included the most incredible chocolate truffles I've ever had! it's right on the canal and just a block from the boat tours, and the neighborhood where you can walk all day to see the lovely touristy shops or the high end shopping district. The Grand keeps taxis on hand for a ride at a moments notice. This place has a historic history and the breakfast buffet was delicious. We're American so they made lovely scrambled eggs from scratch and there were plenty of meats, cheeses, fresh fruit, and breads including those heavenly croissants. In case you can't tell this place ROCKS! It's well worth the price. Review #13:My wife and I stayed at this hotel April 30- May 2. We got to the hotel at noon; check-in was 3 PM. Front desk finally gave us a room at 4:30 PM. The room they provided was on two levels Bed on lower level and bath and closet up 5 steps. Very challenging to maneuver around and use toilet at night. We spoke to many people and a lot of them got stuck with this type of room. Breakfast was included and dining room was disorganized. You had to hail servers to get tea, coffee or hot food. Cold food was buffet. Quality was good but a pain to constantly get someone to bring hot items. This is a big hotel in an old building which could not be renovated sufficiently to keep old world charm with modern conveniences. The service in this hotel is poor, the rates high and they are disorganized. My wife and I are from USA and a fellow guest from Germany commented about the many quality problems at this hotel. I would avoid this hotel even if they offered a great rate. Review #14:The Grand is suitably located at the heart of the medieval city and the atmosphere has a touch of real \"grandieuse\". However, the staff totally ruined it for us: We booked through hotel's own website and opted for the \"stay 4 -pay 3 nights\" package. It was clear that breakfast was not inclusive and as we always enjoy our breakfast during vacation, we clicked the extra \"breakfast\" option as well. We received shortly a confirmatory email, with a total reservation price which included breakfast as requested. However, after checking-in and during breakfast, staff seemed unaware that we decided to include the breakfast option during our reservation and insisted that breakfast was not included in the price. Staff also seemed unwilling (or uncapable) to check the details of our reservation with their own reservation confirmatory email. Thankfully we brought a printout with us, and brought it to the reception desk. The scene with the Reservation Manager taking curious looks and questioning their own email was less than pleasant and unheard of from a 5 star establishment. We received no apologies for this annoyance during our stay. For the history, the balance (for the stay 4-pay 3 package incl. breakfast) was 4 euros less than our initial total reservation price!!! Sofitel The Grand management really needs to set things straight with regards to their reservation, billing and attitude towards guests policies. Review #15:Had an excellent stay. Have rarely encountered such service-oriented staff in The Netherlands. My room was spacious and well equipped. Location is perfect. You get the feel of life along the canals and it is an easy walking distance from key sights and shops, including the flower market. Did not try the restaurants. Yes, it is pricey but you do get a lot in return! Review #16:We got this hotel at a last minute bargain, and I am glad we did. The room, although small (but not smaller than normal European hotel rooms), was very comfortable. The king-size bed was fantastic and I always enjoy a place that gives you a robe with the towels. Very convienent, right next to Dam Square and walkable from the Train Station. I would definitely stay here again. Review #17:The Sofitel is located right next to the RLD. Even in cold weather, it seemed to be a short walk from everything. We stayed in a suite that offered butler service. The service was outstanding. We have stayed at other top hotels/resorts (Four Seasons, Ritz) and this particular Sofitel location was up to snuff. Luis and Domingo went out of their way to help us out, as did the check-in staff. We also used the amenities (indoor pool) and my wife and her sister used the spa services. Great time! They also have working Macs with printers in the lobby area that came in really handy. Review #18:We often travel to Amsterdam and most hotels in the city are small, old, worn, as well as being expensive. We stayed at the Radisson Blu last year and although the rooms were big, it was rather dark in the room and felt more like a business hotel. This year we stayed at the Sofitel and we were very impressed by the renovations they've done. Just walking into the large front courtyard gives you a relaxed feeling right away making you feel at home. The hotel is conveniently located in the city centre of Amsterdam. We stayed for 2 nights in interconecting Superior rooms. The bathrooms were brand new and large (no bath, just shower) but the rooms were compact. We have no complaints about the service, it was sometimes a bit quirky but we wouldn't say it was bad service. Staff were all very nice. There are 2 iMacs in the cozy lounge by the lobby with free access to the internet. Otherwise in the room it's 17 Euros a day. We had the buffet breakfasts on both mornings which had a great selection but at 32 Euros per person you'd hope so. We had dinner in Bridges one night and although the raw seafood platter was extremely good, the main course was average. We'd definitely come back to this hotel again. It's very comfortable and a great place to stay in Amsterdam. The hotel has a similar feel to the Sofitel St James in London. Review #19:I travel a lot and this is one of the best hotel in the world. Everything is perfect, staff, service and room. Location is just amazing, walking distance to a lot of major tourist destination. As an Accor card member, this is one on the only hotel where the card was recognized and acknowledge. Well do not hesitate, if you go to Amsterdam this is the place you want to stay. Review #20:I've stayed at the Sofitel \"The Grand Amsterdam\" hotel a number of times and found it to be outstanding. The city center location is excellent while also being quite and just a little bit removed from the hustle and bustle. I've found the staff to be initially reserved but warm up quickly if you actual converse with them. NOTE: My stays were a few years ago so the Feb 2010 date was the earliest date in the review menu, Review #21:We spent 3 nights at the Grand and stayed in one of their newly renovated apartments, truly amazing with its oversize living-room (complimentary nespresso machine included) and bathroom (best shower ever) and its quiet, comfortable bedroom. Nice view on a small canal (sleepy swans drifting slowly at night, their neck twisted back to rest their head on their feathers, a sight to be seen). I stayed in this hotel 5-6 years ago and it looks so much better now : I remember a very outdated decoration in the bedroom but everything looks fresh now. There were beautiful pink and violet tulips everywhere in the hotel, it was gorgeous. The breakfast room is impressive, not to be missed. Breakfast itself is good although not as good as Sofitel London or Berlin. The food at the restaurant was good, not amazing, and the service a bit slow although restaurant was only half full. Location is very good, red light district very close but you wouldn't believe it, there was absolutely no nuisance from it. Would definitely recommend. Review #22:In many ways this is a lovely hotel in a great location but they do enough things wrong to mar your stay. Be wary of the front desk staff. They will either treat you with respect or contempt but you never know which it will be. The rooms are dated; the wall paper was peeling in mine and carpet had pulled away from the wall in many places. But the rooms are large (for Europe) and the bathroom was spotless. The pool and locker room were also clean and bright but if you book a massage you must pay in cash. Be prepared to sleep with earplugs. There is no other way to put it. The noise level is bad. Review #23:My husband and me booked an escapade, at promotional rates, got upgraded to an apartment suite! Although we didn't use the first floor, it was a nice touch! The location is great; although close to everything, walking distance from the train station, the Dam, the main places, it is an oasis of quiet, a chic ambiance. The hotel itself is worth seeing, with its colored glasses and reminiscences of distinguished guests from bygone times. We didn't try the facilities though, but what we saw was good enough. The service is excellent, (very untypical of the locals, unfortunately), from the reception staff, to Udo, the concierge who makes miracles, or Peter, the bell boy. Would go back, for sure! Review #24:I have stayed two nights in a superior room at the Sofitel. I must say it is not as nice as other Sofitel. The room although 2 levels above Classic room is rather small and furnished ok, and not upscale. The first room that was assigned stunk chemical mized with smoke odors. I was changed for another room without much problem. I did not like the low pressure shower head and the price ( circa EUR 30-35) of the breakfast. The restaurant is not well lighted and the food is ok but not worth EUR30. I liked the location and the pool. In general, l think the room was overpriced (360/night) and the service good but not like with the other Sofitel. Review #25:I had the pleasure of spending 7 nights at the Sofitel Grand Demure in Amsterdam while attending a conference with a girl friend. The Decor was just beautiful and the internal garden just lovely, this Hotel is very Grand and stands upto its name. The weather was not so kind to us but the Hotel Staff were excellent. We had been at The Burj in Dubai before arriving and I can say the Burj staff could learn at lot from the staff at this Hotel. The Hotel is under renovation and only had around 30 rooms available. At no time did we hear the renovations or see work people, it was all handled very well. Our room over looked the front courtyard and canal which was pleasant and it was so nice to be able to have the window open for fresh air at night. It is close to the Red Light area but you wouldnt know it, is very safe. We used the pool and steam room which was very clean. The breakfast buffet was excellent, we didnt need to eat for the rest of the day, the fresh stawberries and raspberries were a real treat. I am the Latte queen, coming from Australia we are used to our coffee a certain way, the dutch are not so much into Lattes but they managed to master my tastes very early on in the stay. The staff made our stay very enjoyable and I would recommend to other travellers. I can imagine this Hotel will be even more Grand after the renovation, well done Soitel and thank you for a pleasant stay. You will remain on my list as a beautiful place to stay and excellent service. Review #26:We loved staying here. We realized it was a splurge, but it was worth it. Every aspect of our stay was wonderful. No one mentions the amazing exterior detailing of the hotel or the courtyard entry. Very charming. The Guest Services person, Zsa Zsa, went out of her way to greet us and treat us warmly. My only complaint is that is was several blocks from the nearest tram. The pool, although below ground level and small, is still lovely. I don't think it would be my choice with small children due to its sophistication. Review #27:Checked in at very short notice for one night via the tourist office - which was originally all that was available. The staff was very helpful in arranging for us to extend to three nights. The rooms are very pleasant ,comfortable and clean with enough of a feeling of luxury to make you feel good about the place. Great location for the town centre but from our room no view at all. Breakfast was good and as plentiful as you want- if a little erratic in the organisation. Hotel and Bar staff very pleasant. A few hiccoughs in that they ended up taking several hundred Euro too much credit card authorisation over and above the room costs even if you accept that they should hold authorisation in case of extras. The receptionist soon found the mistake when it was pointed out, and it was put right after checkout. They were also very good in rectifying the misunderstanding over whether or not breakfast was included for the extended two nights. The building itself is internally beautiful and historic. Unfortunately my wife was put off using the bar facilities after we saw several mice. We were told, with profuse apologies, that this was an ongoing problem during nearby canal restoration works. Review #28:The hotel is in the centre of town so we walked to all the attractions that we wanted to see. The standard rooms are not big but the suitable for us. The used the hotel transfer to and from the airport which made everything very easy as we arrived at different times and no one had to organize money. The highlight of our stay was the concierge Mr Udo Eshuijs who organized medicine for our daughter who had asthma and needed a puffer. He organized the hotel doctor to send a script to the chemist and sent a taxi to collect it then delivered it to the room personally. He suggested various restaurants that were all great and made our stay memorable. If you stay please use his recommendations. Review #29:So beautiful and modern and perfectly clean. Great place for travelers who like nothing but the best. The location was excellent, so close to everything, but beware, it is also very close to the red light district, so, if you may be offended by it, don't stay there or don't take a right once you leave the hotel. It didn't bother us at all so I didn't see it as a problem. The room we stayed was pretty small, but the bed was the most comfortable ever! the curtains were heavy and dark so you could relax and nap at any time of the day. The bathroom was large and very modern and the toiletries excellent. I may be going to other Sofitels around the world! Review #30:Booked room type (deluxe king) not available \"due to construction\" but only found out when we got to the room. Large cobweb in the room and stained grouting in shower area. Room service order delivered incorrectly. 7am alarm call received, waking us up, which we'd not requested! The hotel is in a very good location but so are many less expensive ones! Sofitel are off my list - this is meant to be one of their best and it's really not that good. Review #31:Me and my wife stayed at this wonderful hotel for five days and loved it. Great atmosphere, beautiful architecture and even better service. This hotel can be recommended to everyone who is visiting Amsterdam. It is near al the big tourist attractions and the Central Station. The rooms are very comfortable and the interior is outstanding. This hotel has my vote for best hotel in Amsterdam! Review #32:We have just returned from 3 nights at the Sofitel Grand, staying in a Junior Suite. Our welcome was excellent making us feel as though we had definitely made the right choice. All the staff were friendly throughout the stay although we had a few blips with level of service which is a shame as the hotel has a lot of the ingredients to make it excellent. The location is interesting! In a beautiful building with a lot of history. Be warned though, it is VERY close to the red light district. We are certainly not prudes but the location of the hotel meant that, mainly in the evenings, the area was full of large groups of men on what seemed like 'lads nights out'! I also hate to say that a lot of them were English too who seemed to have had a sherry too many!! Hence lots of noise and lager drinking in the bars nearby the hotel!! Not conducive to a romantic night out!! On our last evening the gas in the hotel kitchens went out and therefore the menu in the restaurant was extremely limited. We had to revert to room service (again a restricted menu because of the problem) and no apology was made for this inconvenience. In our mind the hotel should have given notice that there was a problem so that we had time to make alterntiave arrangements (apparently it had been out all day). Not good for a 5 star hotel. We would return with a group of mates for fun weekend. We wouldn't return for a romantic weekend away with a partner! ! Review #33:Just back from a weekend at the The Grand with two other couples, the hotel itself is on a great site and very central. The rating is five star but is probably more like a very high four as some of the place is in need of a spruce up (its not in bad nick just not five star) however the staff more than made up for any slight shortfall with great service and lots of handy tips. The Sunday bruch is also a good way to come round after a heavy night with a great varied buffet and hair of the dog included in the price. If you have a Sofitel loyalty card the room upgrades a well worth it. We would go back again. Review #34:Only a few steps away from the hustle and bustle around the Old Church and yet as quiet as a mansion in the countryside: That's the Amsterdam Grand Sofitel for you. It's so centrally located that you can actually walk from Amsterdam Centraal train station. Also some of the best restaurants are in close proximity. The hotel used to be a convent and later Amsterdam city hall. Don't miss the council hall, the mayor's office and the marriage chamber \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are all open to the public. Review #35:just returned from the sofitel booked a surprise 50th birthday for my husband. hotel ,rooms, staff, and location were fantastic. the hotel staff were wonderful and made every effort to make our stay special. they presented my husband with a cake and domingo the waiter in the resturant was very hospitable and really nice guy, providing us with information of the city . thanks again to the sofitel we will be back. lorraine, mick robinson and john and lynne hewitt. ps domingo enjoy your friends wedding dont get to drunk you have to work the next day x Review #36:After a glorious refurb. this hotel is looking stunning. The staff seem really to enjoy their work, they are very smart too. Service is superb, friendly, yet very professional. We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a junior suite for 60 euros a night, we did and were not disappointed. The decor is plush, the bathroom in black slate, a huge bath -freestanding and glorious toiletries. We had views from our 5th floor across the Amsterdam rooftops and canals. The hotel could not be in a better position, close to bars, restaurants, sleaze - if you want it and shops. The prices were what you would expect in a 5* hotel, the bar prices were actually reasonable. There is building work in the spa area, we didn't notice so much as a workman, this will be finished in August. We had room service, the food was decent quality, but the menu is limited, great croque monsieur though. There is a simply stunning courtyard bar and restaurant area, which was always lively, being a courtyard it was also an oasis from the hedonistic delights outside. The room was quiet, with excellent air conditioning, TV had BBC1 and2 and a few other English Channels. Parking was 50 Euros a night, but that was to be expected here. Also bottled water seemed very expensive compared to other drinks. The nicest touch was when they brought the car when we left and there was a gift for the journey home; two bottles of water, two muesli bars and two wipe up towelettes, how sweet is that? Review #37:The location of the hotel is just great. It is right in the center of the city. You can walk just about anywhere from the hotel. And the walk from the Central train station is only about 10 minutes. Front reception was very friendly. A man showed us to our room which was on the fourth floor in the corner. They called it a junior suite with two twin beds. Windows looked out onto the front of the hotel over the canal. Very nice views. Bathroom was fantastic. Big tub and separate shower with a window. There was a TV in the bathroom and stereo speakers. The only thing I didn't care for was the glass swing open bathroom doors which did not give enough privacy. Room was very clean. Beds were very comfortable. Some of the best I have experienced. Plenty of room to walk around and separate closets to put clothes. I did not try the restaurant. It was expensive, but looked very nice. The courtyard in the center of the hotel is very nice for drinks. A little expensive, the the atmosphere is worth it. There is a coffee shop right outside the hotel. Every morning and afternoon we would walk by and smell the pot that they were smoking there. Didn't bother me (it's Amsterdam after all), but I wasn't expecting something like that so close to the hotel. Staff at checkout was very friendly. Overall, my stay here was excellent and I would definitely return. The sofitel beds and pillows are so comfortable. This sofitel ranks in the top 3 that I have stayed at. Get a good deal by booking a promotion through their website and you won't regret it. Review #38:A great hotel for lots of money. The room we reserved was much smaller in person than on the website. On inspection we wanted to upgrade and pay. Reception gave us a suite at a reduced price which was very fair. The only odditiy: the hallway to the bathroom went up a half-step, then down then up again. A bit trying in the middle of the night. Also, breakfast was hugely expensive--$90/2 but extraordinary. Champagne and everything one could want. No chance for an egg and some toast--all $45.Otherwise, the location, staff, room and food were outstanding. Review #39:We stayed here for three nights. It is as comfortable, indeed as luxurious as any reasonable person could ask. The staff was pleasant and helpful, but unintrusive. Some people might find the location too close to the Red Light district, to the right of the entrance, but to the left is the University area. Amsterdam is a compact and dense city. We walked to the museum neighborhood in about 45 minutes. Trams and taxis are plentiful and reasonable. And English is virutally the second native tongue. The hotel restaurant is very good as is the one in the nearby Hotel Europe, and there are many nearby restaurants in all price (and quality) ranges. Only at the time of checkout was there acrimony. We had found a good rate on the internet, oddly through a hotel site based in Utrecht, averaging 265 euros, and they had already taken it from our credit card. They insisted that the actual rate was 295 euros per day, plus city tax. The first person refused to budge, and her supervisor at first said it was impossible to adjust. We had our confirmation number, and then the supervisor relented. If you are paying less than the full rate, I recommend you keep proof of the agreed price. Except for this, it was a superior hotel. Review #40:Although we had booked months previous to our arrival, we arrived to discover our children (13 & 15) had been put in a room on a completely different floor to us. The girl who assisted us at reception was very cold and almost rude. It was Christmas and although we could see that people were enjoying Christmas treats in the bar, we not asked to partake; nor were we given any introduction to the hotel facilities. This cold treatment continued for our entire stay (5 nights). The concierge made us feel that any question or required assistance was an imposition - it was really unbelievable. Probably felt even more as we had just previously been in a hotel in Prague (The Augustine) which was not only superior in every way, but where the staff were so warm and friendly we felt sad to leave!! Anyway - our rooms, although attractive, were tiny with far too much furniture/lamps etc which we were forever bumping into! The bathrooms were tiny, so we continually tripped over each other. The beds were too too soft, even by European standards. The breakfasts (not included) were exorbitant - infact the only saving grace was that the rooms contained an espresso machine, so we could have our morning coffee then eat elsewhere!! We have previously stayed at the Pulitzer, which is old but charming - I would definitely not stay at The Grand Amsterdam again, I could have forgiven all of the room faults if the services at the front desk had been friendlier..... but there is no excuse for cold staff Review #41:We loved this hotel, the entrance and the courtyard have been renovated beautifully. The decoration is trendy, cozy, romantic and elegant. The rooms are a nice size, the bathrooms renovated and are smart with nice amenities. Our room had its own Nespresso machine. The hotel is conveniently located and in walking distance to movies, galleries(- the Van Gogh is a must see! ) The staff is incredibly helpful and efficient! We would recommend this hotel to our family and friends. Review #42:Stayed here for about 10 days in July. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms were normal size for European standards, with a nice bathroom and good range of Hermes ammenities (though for me, they felt more a scent men would prefer than women). Bed was softer than I am normally use to, but comfortable none the less. Use the free \"low speed\" internet in my room, which met all my needs e.g. could still do skype video chats etc. My room faced the inner courtyard, so was very quiet. Breakfast is very good, but you have to order hot food (so if you are in a rush, order it as soon as you step inside). Hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the main train station, and just on the edge of the red light district and shoppin area. So you are not in the middle of any, but only a stones throw away, which made the hotel very suitabel for me (ie all the convenience without the noise, but again I had a inner courtyard viewing room). lastly, there is a gym, but it is very small with just a few cardio machines and some weights and one other machine. Only 2 small negatives were , the room rate is not cheap for those on a budget, and the lift if you need it is al little slow. All in all, a great hotel, good location, nice rooms, and friendly staff Review #43:My stay at the Grand Sofitel Demeure for 4 nights in July, 2006 was excellent. I paid 295 euros as a summer rate for a spacious junior suite on the courtyard. Clean and well maintained. Very quiet except for muffled early evening conversations from outdoor diners in the courtyard. Top location on a quiet street only a couple of blocks from the Dam. Secluded feeling. Intimate atmosphere. No smoking rooms. Four computers in business center for free internet access. Superb dinners in wonderful courtyard during the summer--expensive, but worth the price. Very good breakfast buffet. Friendly and efficient staff. I prefer to the Pulitzer and L'Europe. Don't confuse with the other Sofitel in Amsterdam that is closer to the train station. Only defect was thermostat that had to be turned on or off manually--strong and effective air conditioning, but never turned off except by a flip of the switch. Probably a quirk of my room. An elegant and very satisfying hotel. Review #44:Stayed in this hotel for a long weekend last year and it really was beautiful. Fantastic breakfasts! Had dinner in the restuarant and that was excellent also. Only down side was the bar was really smoky but then most of Amsterdam is! Would recommend the hotel but probably will not go back to Amsterdam as it was nice but i hate smoking! ! Review #45:My girlfriend and i have just spent 2 nights at the Sofitel Amsterdam The Grand. The location was great, the decoration of great taste but the service was not worthy of a 5-star. If you intend to use the spa facilities, please be aware that it is currently being renovated, so no access there. We booked the cheapest room which featured : - No bathtub (never seen that in any hotel at all, let alone a \"5-star\" ! - Broken glass on the floor ! (they apologized and offered us a complementary bottle of wine, which was nice). - No TV remote control (i had to go down to reception to ask for one..). - No direct access by phone to the reception. - Dusty shelves in the bathroom. - Scratches on the furniture. - The complementary bottle of water was not replaced overnight. Except for the glass, you might think that these are small details of no importance, but when you add them all together it does somehow lessen the appeal of this great hotel and diminishes the rating too. Still a very good place to stay. The staff are kind and well intentioned, but it shouldn't be hard work for the customer as it was for me. We did not have lunch nor breakfast in the hotel, so i cannot comment on the food. Review #46:Stayed here in September with three friends. I travel frequently and have stayed in a lot of hotels worldwide. This hotel had one of the best standard of bedrooms I have seen. The beds are amazingly comfortable. The bathrooms are incredibly modern with fantastic rain showers. It is close to the red light district but if you turned left out of the hotel then you may not have noticed. Staff were wonderful and attentive. The restaurant was a little short staffed during the breakfast which led to delays but there are few who would possibly want to pay for it. Although good, very expensive - even by hotel standards. Wonderful architecture and history to the building which I prefer to modern hotels. Review #47:Wonderful stay in the heart of Amsterdam! The restaurant serves amazing seafood, the bar is cosy and opens on a intimate garden. Service is elegant and friendly. There is a fireplace room next to the lobby where it is nice to relax and have a drink after walking around Amsterdam. We'll come back! Review #48:My favorite hotel in Amsterdam. This is a truly Grand hotel. It is within an easy walk from Centraal Station. 2 blocks to the Dam Square, many museums are walkable, the Anne Frank House and the Flower Market are also walkable. Bridges Restaurant within the hotel is excellent, particularly for seafood. They have a good wine list which includes a few selections from Holland as well. The central courtyard is delightful in warm months for dining or a drink. The lobby bar area is quiet, relaxing and has good selection of single malts. Review #49:We have just returned from the Sofitel, which is in a very lovely building with warm, welcoming and attentive staff. Everything is done to ensure that their guests feel comfortable. Breakfast is a sumptuous affair - probably one of the best I have had anywhere. So good in fact that we just lingered for much longer than we would normally do over breakfast. Ours was a ' superior ' room and whilst being very comfortable, was quite compact. The pool is calm and peaceful and very welcome after a busy sight seeing day. The location of the hotel is perfect as most important locations are within walking distance (or borrow/hire bicycles from the hotel). The only thing that would have made the stay perfect was if our bed could have been made properly, without any creases in the too large quilt cover for the quilt, & if the bottom sheet had been properly laid on the mattress so it could be firmly tucked in. I had to remake the bed on our first 2 nights & yes I could have called someone to do it, but we were ready for bed & had already got in to go to sleep, so it was just quicker & easier to do it myself. I told reception about it after the 2nd night & certainly it was better on the 3rd night, but I still had to readjust the (now better fitting) quilt cover to get rid of the creases on the underside of the quilt. It is really not difficult to make a bed and in a hotel like this it should be perfect. Once the bedding was properly in place, we slept really well as the beds are very comfortable. So overall, if you get a maid who can make a bed you will have a lovely time in this hotel. If I knew I wouldn't have to make my bed I would be happy to stay again! Review #50:Very chic hotel, very well-placed near the main tourist sites and with very warm and friendly service, which you normally don't get in places like this. The design of the hotel is modern, cool and very trendy. The restaurant is superlative but very pricey. We had a breakfast there too, very expensive but incredibly rich both in quantity and diversity of food. The rooms were to die for. We loved it and can't wait to go back. Review #51:I have stayed at the Grand a dozen times, but i had not been back since it was remodeled. Now I do agree that the bathrooms needed work, the showers were a joke, water all over the floor every time you used them. They have been improved greatly. My problem is with the rest of the room, very poorly designed. Try to get to the closet or the in room safe, almost impossible. The lighting is just TERRIBLE. The color schemes do not help being very dark. It is just not possible to sit in the living room of the suite and do anything but maybe watch TV. The spa was under construction but i did get a peak inside, nice addition. The Library internet area is probably the nicest addition but with just two computers it was constantly in use. The new restaurant, Bridges is touted as one of Amsterdam's finest, I thought that the breakfast buffet was nowhere near as nice as the former Roux offerings so we did not bother. We did enjoy the bar staff and the oysters, the staff could not have been better and more helpful. I think that maybe they should have fixed the bathrooms and changed the furniture and TV's but left the hotels charm alone. We used to enjoy hanging out in our Suite and having drinks and room service, but the ambiance has been ruined. I have stayed in many of the Suites and Jr. Suites but i have mixed feelings about returning, I have no idea what room I would request. I found the front office staff excellent as was the concierge. Anyone that goes to Amsterdam and does not buy their tickets to the Van Gogh from a concierge is making a very BIG mistake, you simply bypass the huge line and go to the fast track line, no waiting. My first hotel that I stayed at was the Hotel De L'Europe, which is also into a very large remodel, and i am afraid they are making some of the same mistakes that the Grand has made and have gone too modern. Review #52:My husband and I decided to stay here after an exhaustive search of the hotels in AMS. I ended up getting a great deal on the hotel website--295 Euros for a junior suite with breakfast included. The room was very large and overlooked the canal. The location in great--centrally located and easy to get to everything (although AMS is really not that big compared to London, etc...) . Location is very near red light district and there are some rather loud bars just down the street from the hotel. However, even with out room facing out toward the street, I really didn't hear them. The courtyard of the hotel was another plus--quiet and beautful. I also loved the historic backgroud of the hotel and enjoyed exploring some of the older meeting rooms. All in all--a great stay at the Grand! Review #53:I travel a lot and stay in lots of hotels for fun and work. This hotel is amazing! I always pay attention to the service and here I was amazed. It was a dream! Please note that The Netherlands is a country were generally the client is almost never first even if you spend considerable amounts of money, i.e., Metz & Co in Amsterdam - worst client service ever. Don't bother to visit. So with that said that this hotel makes yout stay lovely!! The staff puts attention to every detail. Everybody is friendly, attentive and food and quality are great. Loved room service and I was amazed by the service at the restaurant too. They have delicious sea food. During our stay, We got three times drinks from the house. We got upgraded so we stayed the first night in a suite and it was perfect! Living room, dinning room. Big bathroom and lovely room with walk in closet. We can't complain at all. We couldn't leave the hotel after the great expirience. And we literally didn't leave the hotel since we went from room to great restaurant and bar and then decided to stay another night. This time we got a normal room and still we enjoyed it very much. Thanks to the good attitude of staff. This hotel is well located since its in the middle of the center and still gives you the relax feeling. If you want to make use of the spa book it in advance because it could be very busy. It is quite expensive but it's more than worth it. You won't regret it. Review #54:Our third time at this hotel, and the place is still revealing itself. We were upgraded to a jr suite on the OLD courtyard. The court wasnt very noisy since the windows were double glass, but the courtyard's lights at night could be a problem unless you draw the curtains which the evening maid will do for you. The room was nice size with high ceilings probably equal to a normal hotel room here in the states but with very nice understated old dutch modern furniture and deep ruby carpets, obviously the place needs an update but it was still very posh compared to other amsterdam hotels, and the services are very good. I love the room service kitchen, breakfast, lunch, and dinner were all truly wonderful and their coffee was so good. I love how convenient it is the rest of city; it is literally in the middle of this circular city. I had some clothes cleaned over night since I missed the early morning pickup, and I thought they would be automatically delivered when done, but I had to ask for them, and I had them in ten minutes, so the place isnt' perfect. However, they are thoughtful in other ways, like on thanksgiving they surprised us with a dessert tray of punkin pies, and thinking my friend and I were business travelers, they rearranged our room and divided the king into two twins . I love the amstel too but the grand is special as well in it's own slightly more casual and user friendly way. The dollar does not go far in europe but i still found the hotel an overall fairvalue, but hope that things get better for our dollar so I can soon return to the grand again. Review #55:Stayed at the Grand for 2 nights last weekend in a Junior Suite and could not fault it in any way. Location is great, on the edge of the red light district but lovely and peaceful. Staff were extremely helpful - nothing was too much trouble. Ate breakfast in the Cafe Roux and found it to be excellent value for money, with extremely attentive wating staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel. Review #56:The hotel is centrally located, 10 minutes walk to the Central Station. But some locals got it mixed up with other Sofitel and it took us a while to find it. Although it is right next to the red light district, it is tucked away and is quiet and safe. It is close to most sight seeing places. The room is spacious, tastefully refurnished and well designed. The bathroom is simple, clean and contemporary. I am very fussy about bathroom and I was happy with this. But water leaked from the glass partition of the shower. The hotel is still undergoing some major renovation but it did not create any noise. They provided free internet at the business centre. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise. The food was nice and not too over priced. It is trully a five star hotel. Review #57:I was there with my wife for 3 days for a business meeting. Our room was above average. We were on the first floor next to the canal but the noise was acceptable. We ate in the dining room for breakfast and had catered lunches for our meetings, all of which were good. I liked the location which was certrally located. The internal garden next to and serviced by the bar was epically nice.I thought the staff was uniformaly friendly and attentive. Review #58:I stayed in this hotel for one night recently and absolutely loved it! We got the train from the airport to the city (just over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3) and then got a taxi for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11 to the hotel. We arrived early so we couldn't check-in straightaway as the room wasn't ready yet but the receptionist gave us a map of the city and gave us advice on the best restaurants and sites nearby. She couldn't have been more helpful. The room was huge and had a canal view. Large bathroom as well. Location was great. Red-light district is just around the corner from the hotel but the hotel itself is very quiet. Our room looked out over the front of the hotel and we couldn't hear a thing. Plenty of things to see and do nearby and nearly everything is within walking distance. I recommend that you get the I Amsterdam card when you get there - you get free trams and buses and entrance into most of the major museums and sites. You also get 2 free canal boat rides and discounts on a lot of other attractions. We got the 48-hr card for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac43 - well worth it! Review #59:Very nice hotel with very friendly staff. Clean, spacious rooms, nice bathrooms. They could have some more cushion on the pillow topper for the bed for my preference. The windows are not sound proofed. The door is not sound proofed at all. The location is said to be near Red Light district but it is actually far enough to not notice anything at all. There are often celebrities staying at this hotel. Review #60:Travelled to Amsterdam with Partner who was at hotel for a conference. Hotel facade was covered in scaffolding. The hotel accepted a reservation for a Premium Suite with Canal View. Canal view completely obscured by scaffolding, except for one window in bedroom. Other bedroom window looks straight into somebody's apartment!! Probably a good room if you are a voyeur. To say this was a Premier Suite is a joke. It looks to be furnished by Ikea, although at least with Ikea furniture you dont usually have electical wires and extension cables running along the floor in full view. The dark brown and crimson carpet does not help the ambiance either. Bed is extremely comfortable but with only 12\" of space either side of the bed it is a tight fit. Luckily their was no cat to swing!! Workmen started work directly outside the room at 7.45am making further sleep impossible, despite being told by reception staff that we should not be bothered by noise!! Buffet Breakfast at 34Euros is a joke. Staff are friendly but basically clueless. It took 3 goes at getting someone to bring a pepper pot to the table!! And had somebody else's breakfast delivered to the table twice by mistake by two different people! I suppose this maybe considered a 5* hotel if you think travelling by Easyjet or Ryanair is luxurious. It is just a rather clumsy attempt by a rather mediocre chain, Sofitel, of trying to move into the luxury travel section, when they should stay doing what they do well, 3* - 4* hotels. Last month I stayed at true 5* hotels from the Aman & Shangri-la Chains, Sofitel comes nowhere near their level. I am not the only person to be upset with the hotel, 4 other delegates from the hotel are very disappointed here and some even changed rooms. I Review #61:My son and I recently stayed over at this hotel. Generally the service was good although I would not have made a reservation at this hotel if I realized that the bathrooms offer showers only. I enjoy a soak in a hot bath after walking all day long day but had to suffice with a shower. The water leaked out from under the shower door over the bathroom floor and had to mopped up every time I sued the shower. Water from the wash hand basin drains very slowly. Location is very central as one can walk to most places of interest. Ask for a room higher up off the street as I was woken up at 3 o'clock one morning when 4 taxi drivers decided to have a disagreement outside my bedroom window. Also the garbage bins are moved out on the pavement in the mornings which cause a lot of noise. The steps up to the bathroom and/or down to the bedroom could also be a nuisance especially during the night. Towels, linen, pillows and so on were all in good condition. Overall quite good although I would not return to this property for the reasons given above. Review #62:this is a nice hotel which is going through a much needed renovation project. the bar has been closed and an obviously temporary one has been set up, though for a temporary bar it is very nice with good service. the room i was in was a good size and very clean though does need updating as it was a touch 80's esque. all the staff i encountered were very friendly and helpful when called upon.the spa is minimal but the pool is big enough so long as you dont have to share it with anyone else. in summary this is a hotel i have stayed at twice now and i feel i have experienced all that it has to offer, in saying that, i would not stay here again as i feel that twice is enough and i would like to experience other hotels in amsterdam but i would recommend it as it is a good hotel. oh...it is also in a great location just on the edge of the redlight district ,you feel, as indeed you are, bang in the middle of things. Review #63:Close to the center of things but flanked by two quiet canals, Sofitel The Grand Amsterdam provides an excellent base for tourist or business traveler. The former Amsterdam city hall has become a luxurious hotel with an excellent seafood restaurant. It is an easy ten-minute walk from the train station and all the principal tourist stops are likewise easily accessible. The service is excellent, the rooms plush. Review #64:Location: Great!!! You are right in the center of Amsterdam, very close to red light district but set in a very secluded and quiet courtyard. Food: We only had room service while staying but food was very good. Service: The attitute of the staff was very helpful and efficient. The concierge was useful and helped out with museum tickets. Room: Managed to get upgraded from Deluxe room to Appartment. Room was large and clean. The decor was a bit dated but overall ok. The bed was great, very comfortable. Overall: Service was fast and efficient, Food was good and location was great. I would happily stay here again. Review #65:We stayed 3days in this hotel and enjoyed it a lot. Never the less there are some points they should work on: Pros: +Location (it\u00c2\u00b4s really in the center of amsterdam) +If you have a room with courtyard view it\u00c2\u00b4s quiet (I don\u00c2\u00b4t know the other rooms) +Nice and -for Amsterdam-standard- quite big rooms, furnished in an old fashioned but nice way +good business center Cons: -The quality of service is sometimes not the one of a 5-star hotel (waiting time and some of the guys are a little bit arrogant). -Take your reservation with you - they tried to charge a much higher price at the check out compared to the one I booked at [--] (Of course this could happen anywhere, but I read about the same thing in another review too, so be prepared) -Paying 28\u00e2\u201a\u00ac p.P. for a breakfast is redicolous - go elsewhere in Joordan Quarter -The resteraunt-tip from the hotel-staff had two problems: A) It was closed and B) from outside it looked like a tourist-trap I would never walk in Enjoy your trip... Review #66:The stay and service was as good as expected with an hotel from this level. Looked good, felt good, was good. Especcially as platinum member, it felt good to be there. Only, the bill in the hotelbar was a bit (unexpted) high. But, was our own foult and worth it :-) Great! Review #67:We stayed here for only one night in the Easter weekend with three children. The service was excellent. Staff really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The rooms were lovely decorated. The children were thrilled to find huge chocolate bunnies in their rooms. The restaurant was excellent. You need to book way ahead of time because it is often full. Breakfast was a bit chaotic not enough staff to keep up with everybody. We organized a small boat with captain from the hotel. A bit expensive but really worth seeing Amsterdam from a boat through the canals. It is a lovely hotel. Nicely decorated and quiet location. Unfortunately they were renovating the spa area so we could not try out the swimming pool. Review #68:This hotel is perfect in every way. It's location near Dam square. It's Cafe Roux restaurant ,buffet breakfast, housekeeping staff, front desk, concierge, bartender,etc. Our room was quite large. We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite upon arrival. Our every request was handled without any problems. My wife & I were celebrating our anniversary with the final two days in Amsterdam. I've become a Sofitel customer since staying here. They even arranged a fixed rate for our taxi returning to Schipol airport Bob C. Columbus Ohio Review #69:Stayed for 5 days in August. Delighted to get an upgrade to a junior suite and very impressed to be taken their by our \"personal butler\". The hotel location is fantastic - right next to but not in, the busiest part of town. The room was huge, a wonderful canal view, with every amenity possible .......at first sight. There was a Nespresso machine which we used, the capsules were never replaced so after 6 cups between two of us we had to ask for more. There was some fruit in the room - we ate it and it was not replaced. It was a lottery as to what combination of bath towels, small towels and face cloths would appear. We asked the butler to arrange afternoon tea in the library for us and 3 friends - nothing special, it was an advertised service. 5 minutes later he was up in the room with menus asking us to choose - but the friends were not due until the afternoon so we said we would decide specifics then. (The specifics were which tea, and did we want champagne). Friends arrived, no sign of tea in the library and no one knew of then request. Butler was summoned and appeared to sort it out - 4 teas arrived for 5 people. The hotel was very expensive - even for a junior suite - you are paying for location and room. Service was pretty second rate. One final thing - we had the room buy the lift and every time it moved we could hear it winding up and down. Did not stop us sleeping but it did disturb our sleep. Review #70:We were a party of 7 and we stayed at The Grand from September 30 to October 3. The brick exterior was beautiful and the modern lobby was a good contrast to it. Check in was a breeze and guest relations manager Zsa Zsa even escorted us to our room. She was most friendly and helpful. Everyday before and after dinner we would enjoy drinks at the terrace, in the courtyard formed by the hotel's different buildings that were connected together. The staff at the terrace were friendly and very efficient. The concierge staff were also very efficient and helpful in terms of providing dinner reservations and transport services. The entire staff, from the restaurant to housekeeping to the doormen were the epitome of gracious, hospitable and efficient service. The bed in our room was so comfortable, if Amsterdam wasn't such an exciting city it might have been doubly difficult to get out of bed in the mornings. Breakfast was always delicious and had a good variety to choose from. The hotel was located only 5 minutes away from the red light district. We also booked a private dinner cruise and we were picked up by the skipper at the hotel's front door. The company's name is Belle Epoque and they served a 3-course dinner where each course was obtained from gourmet restaurants. From starter to dessert, it was well worth it! The skipper and her assistant were a joy to cruise with. I love Amsterdam and I love The Grand! Review #71:Amsterdam is an interesting exciting place but i was a bit sceptical about the hotel choices as there weren't many options for 5 star luxury which i am fanatical about. However when we checked into this hotel we were pleasantly surprised. The location is amazing as it is a short walk to the red light district and other interesting hot spots. We stayed in a luxury room and it was furnished nicely, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was quiet large and also very nice. The view out the window was of another building so didnt get much out of that. We ordered a few times from room service and the food was quiet enjoyable. Had dinner once at the Bridges restaurant, the service was good and so was the food. The concierge service was average and overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. This is not the most luxurious 5 star hotel you will stay in but in Amsterdam i think this was the perfect choice. Review #72:This hotel must be the worst I have ever stayed in. It all started with check in, when I was given a room key to a room that was already occupied by others,... This was solved OK by the front office staff. I found the rooms to be tiny and extremely dark. Then we decided after a walk over the canals (make sure you don't turn right, because that's were the red light district is) to have dinner at the Bridges Restaurant. The service was again poor, with an arrogant hostess and so/so food. Breakfast was reasonably good, but then the great surprise came out upon check out; we were charged for minibar items that we never used (?!?) After complaining to this and speaking to the manager, this was waived. Will definitely not recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family. Review #73:The location is very central and the building (a former city hall) has a lot of potential. The rooms are terribly dated (the bathroom is just fine, typical Sofitel, but small: no separate shower). The spa is small, dark and very hot. The food at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Roux is good but not outstanding. Breakfast is a decent buffet with average service and little attention to detail (e.g. wilted flowers in chipped vases on the tables). Given the rates they charge, the place should be completely renovated (which they plan to do). Review #74:We have been lucky and stayed in some great hotels over the years but our recent stay Sofitel The Grand was one of the best. From the moment we arrived the staff could not have done more to help every single person was excellent and really cared about making a difference to our stay. They fused over our little boy and made him feel welcome which is not always the reaction in hotels. The room was superb, big and comfortable with a great bathroom. Swimming pool was great and food both in room and in Bridges was great. Although not the cheapest hotel it was money well spent and good value. Would definitely recommend to anyone. It really is one of the best hotels in the world. Review #75:We stayed at The Grand for 3 nights 02-05 August 2007. This hotel is in a terrific location, easy to reach the Dam Square, Central Station, etc. We did not experience any noise problems mentioned by others. Entering via the lovely entrance courtyard we felt somewhat removed from all of the crowds of people. Our room looked out on the canal but we were not affected by people walking by. Room was in good shape, not excellent, but certainly what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Our only disappointment was the concierge staff. We felt they were indifferent to our rather simple (restaurants, sightseeing) requests. Other than that, we'd certainly return. We have previously stayed at the Amstel but liked the location of The Grand much better. Review #76:I stayed here for 3 days with my wife. The hotel is very good and the atmosphere is very nice. Very good service from the staff. Please don't do any rehabilitations in the bar area. That area is very good. I did not like the new rooms. To modern. The bed was VERY good. After a long day walk it was very nice to relax in the garden with one Duvel beer and a glas of wine. Review #77:We stayed for three nights in the Grand and couldn't have been more impressed. We had perfect peace and quiet in a lovely room overlooking the central courtyard (away from the front street which does border onto the more 'lively' red light district). The staff were friendly, spoke perfect English, and there was no effort spared to make our stay enjoyable and relaxing. A truly 5-star experience for us. Review #78:Amsterdam can be a bit rainy, which is to be expected, but on one of our days it was absolutely torrential all day. This is the perfect hotel to be as we never had to leave. we ventured out into the cold and rain for a bit, but came back to a spa visit and a little time in the sauna to warm up. Service here is definitely first rate, Gabrielle went out of our way upon check in (room was not ready) - but we had an upgrade to a junior suite and their IT person came by while we were waiting and hooked up our internet. From making dinner reservations to ensuring all our needs were met, this hotel met all of our needs. Central location and very easy to navigate from there. Review #79:Sofitel The Grand was our second stop on a 4 stop honeymoon. The hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade and champagne to celebrate the occasion. Aside from the upgrade, the staff was extremely warm and welcoming upon check-in. They escorted us to our beautiful room which overlooked the courtyard and walked us through all of the features of the hotel room. The room was well decorated and very clean. The bathroom was amazing, with a dual head shower, a large soaking tub and his and hers sinks. Also, the location of the hotel itself was great as we were within walking distance of the city center. We both used the gym, swimming pool and steam room (all complimentary) during our stay. While the gym was definitely tiny, the indoor pool was a decent size. The concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations were all a hit from Pancake Bakery, to a new Vietnamese restaurant, to a great wine bar. Even though the weather wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ideal (pockets of rain the whole weekend) our trip was excellent because of Sofitel The Grand. We will definitely be back and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of staying anywhere else! Review #80:The hotel was in the middle of a renovation, so sometimes the elevator didn't work. But the staff was very friendly and always took us up in the 'construction' elevator. The breakfast there was wonderful. We did not eat dinner there, however, as it was very expensive. Review #81:I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my wife, before a business trip to Germany. The location is perfect, everything is close to walk distance. The staff was Ok, just a few confused during my check-in, but everybody were gentle and polite. The room was a charm! There is a restaurant in the hotel (The Bridges) with a wonderful food, excellent staff and a good price. Definitely we recommend the Sofitel Amsterdam. Review #82:We stayed there for a weekend in August and it was amazing. We booked a superior double room but when we checked in, we were upgraded to a suite with a butler service. It was great, the butler helped us book a table at a restaurant, and answered every question that we had. The room was great as well. The massage in the hotel's spa can only be recommended! The location was great as well. I can only recommend this hotel and we will be staying there again when in Amsterdam Review #83:This is definitely the best hotel I've stayed in in Amsterdam. We actually drove there from the UK, and the valet met us, and deposited our car in the garage - the parking was included in the price, so that was nice. The hotel was realyl plush, and you enter via a courtyard, so even if you walk past the hotel, you have no idea what it's like inside unless you go in. Lovely room, with opulent decor, overlooking a lovely courtyard at the rear of the hotel. Filled with lovely vegetation, it was nice to not be looking over the street, and gave a real feel of privacy. Great location, just moments from Dam Square, and the Red Light District. Not cheap, but so much nicer than staying anywhere else in the city! Review #84:I have stayed in many gorgeous hotels in the past, but this one beats most of them on many grounds: 1) it's in amsterdam! Old Europe, home of tiny houses, cramped hotel rooms, dark hallways.. Yet the grand is, well... Grand... Spacious, luxurious, airy, light.... The courtyard is gorgeous, the garden is peaceful, and the room was beautiful. 2) the service is something I had not had for a long time in Europe. I am not saying that european service is bad... No, just that Asian and middle eastern (read, dubai) service is just better... Well, the grand was definitely at par, with dubai... Except that it felt geniun...so actually better than dubai 3) location location location: perfect! 4) price: steep. But then again it's the Grand... If you can afford it, if u can smuggle it during a business trip... Do it! Review #85:Just returned from what was an excellent stay at The Grand. My wife and I and another couple stayed for 2 nights and had a great time. We arrived from a really early flight at about 10 am and didn't really expect to get checked in before 3pm.We got checked in by around 11am but what we really appreciated was that they upgraded us both to a Junior Suite, beautiful high ceilings , fantastically comfortable beds and good bathrooms. I had emailed the conscierge a week earlier to book a restaurant and had 'mentioned' that both parties were there to celebrate a birthday so perhaps that helped in the upgrade.The hotel is a beautiful old building with alot of history and the location is second to none being just around the corner from the RLD, 2 minutes walk from Dam Square and even next door to The Greenhouse Coffee Shop(for those of you who require a herbal pick me up). We used a taxi to get to The Van Gogh Museum and Rijks museum ( both superb) and there seemed to be a Mercedes taxi on tap in the hotel courtyard at all times which was great .. The service in the hotel was top notch and the breakfast buffet was one of the best I have had(champagne and all). Another nice feature of the hotel was being able to go for a sauna and swim after a hard days sightseeing,( I think it is one of the very few hotels in Amsterdam to have these facilities). To sum up The Grand,a Top quality hotel,Great location , Impeccable service and a perfect place to spoil yourself for a few days in what is a beautiful city. Review #86:Stayed at The Grand two nights in two connecting rooms (one king size bed for my wife and myself, second twin beds for our two kids). The location is just perfect, in the heart of Amsterdam at walking distance of main attractions. The Hotel itself is beautiful, an ancient historical building well renovated and decorated. The concierges were extremely helpful and caring. Rooms spacious and with VERY comfortable beds. Hotel facilities very good. Evevrything perfect.... One \"negative\" detail: we expected a much more \"luxurious\" breakfast buffet, the one we had was just fine.... We would definitely come back! AAA! Highly recommended. PS: the afternoon tea at bar, with scones and sandwiches is a total MUST! Review #87:Like others, I almost did not stay here because of the negative comments about proximity to the red light district and noise. We are on the 3rd floor, overlooking the canal and it is lovely. No noise at all. The red light district is not close - you have to make an effort to get there. We have stayed previously at the Fusion Suites and although liked it very much, we wanted to be a bit more central and have more amenities. The Fusion is really a B&B. The Sofitel is very comfortable, and although a larger luxury hotel it retains it dutch feeling. The area is lovely and central to everything. I was on my own a good deal as my husband was attending a conference and at no time did I worry about walking on my own or around the area of this hotel. The concierge has sent us to wonderful restaurants (not touristy ones - more where the dutch would eat). the staff are very friendly and always remember our names. After a long day walking, I truly appreciated the long deep bathtub. If you want a cute canal house - this is not for you but if you want luxury, amenities, excellent staff and a great location, then look at the Sofitel. Review #88:I have stayed at most of the top hotels in Amsterdam and this is def. one of them! The location is good but it all depends on what you are doing in Amsterdam. Its very close to the red light district which can be a bit annoying if you are not into that because you will easily cross the red light district when walking around... Lobby is quite dark but the rooms are light and the bed are SUPER comfortable! Bed and Breakfast! This is not an B&B but its the best par of the hotel! The bed & the breakfast! Breakfast is really really good with a huge selection of fruit and FRESH juice! Also I think the restaurant has a michelin star or use to have, very good! Reason why I dont give the hotel 5 stars is value, Its very expensive and its not that good! I have a few hotels in Amsterdam I prefer over this. Review #89:Wow! What a perfect stay! We had booked a junior suite yet on arrival were upgraded to a prestige suite which was unbelievable. We had a separate livingroom with all the amenities and more (Bose sound system, nespresso machine to name a few) the bathroom had a fantastic shower and bath with television and then a very comfortable and luxurious bed. We had a the breakfast each morning and were amazed by the food and choices available as well as later sampling some delicious cocktails! The location is fabulous, although at the red light district you would never be aware of this and it makes it so easy to explore the city centre on foot as everything is near by. I have to leave the best to last though, the service was just fantastic. Not once did a member of staff walk by without a welcome. The staff were all so kind, polite and efficient. On our first night my now fianc\u00c3\u00a9e proposed, on hearing this news we were then presented with a complimentary bottle of champagne and congratulated, adding to the wonderful moment. I really would recommend staying in this hotel, not only for the luxury but the excellent customer service. Review #90:A truly beautiful and histoic building...a magnificent structure built in the 1500's but updated with the latest modern designs inside. A great mix. Very nice service from housekeeping and in the restaurant. The concierge staff was also top notch. We had a couple problems with front desk not understanding our needs due to language, but otherwise they tried very hard to assure top level service. The location was also wonderful since it allowed us to be a little off of the main streets but within a few short blocks of Dam Square and was able to walk to the Rijksmuseum (20 minutes tops) access to a number of the main attractions. Each morning we awoke to a view of the canal with a dozen or so swans swimming and the hooves of horses with carriages on the small road across the canal. We had a junior suite - it was spacious and had nice decor. Loved the bathrooms! And the turn down service with chololates on each of the nightstands. Only downside was they did not have the room down free (they understand the word feathers more than the word down) - so we had to order that again and wait, and the TV was not working and the phone had issues. The service people were all very nice though. Just a small pain to not be able to really relax till all the service folks came and went. Review #91:We stayed at the beginning of June and it was a fantastic hotel, the staff could not have been more attentive. Only minor downside - my room faced one of the canals and was slightly noisy now and again, would suggest If you want a quiet room ask for a room overlooking the courtyard. Review #92:This has to be without doubt the worst experience I have every had at a 4 or 5 star hotel ( I would have been upset at a 3 star rating for this place). On arrival our room was not ready. Once we were introduced to our room it looked tired and dim with 2 twin beds (requested double/ king). The first night I was called by the reception at 2am because of a problem with my credit card (transpires operator error at the reception). Having travelled extensively around the world the 5 star rating is simply a joke! It seems it is some corrupt method of extracting more money from the unsuspecting public. I imagine their return occupancy rates to be me minimal if not non existent. I would wish you luck with this place but you would need more than look to enjoy this place! Review #93:Have just returned from a wonderful weekend at The Grand, what a truly wonderful Hotel. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, and we received impeccable service. The Bridges restaurant, I have to mention, is one of the finest restaurants I have dined in, the ambience, the decor, the food and staff all were amazing, i haven't checked, but if this restaurant doesn't have a Michelin star it, definitely requires several. Food from Te Raw bar is a MUST to sample, and the b\u00c3\u00a9arnaise sauce is to die for, alongside the entrcote steak !!!!!! I have to stop writing, as it is making me salivate..... I haven't had a weekend in amsterdam for a long time, this place makes we want to go again, i think I may well have just found one of my favourite places on earth........ Also the beds!!!!!! !soft, warm, a wonderful turn down at night, with slippers and chocolates, seriously, you must visit this place......... Review #94:We arrived on Thursday and were welcomed by the doorman. Checking was easy but we were not shown to our room and the presentation of the hotel services and facilities was all too brief. The room was a good size and well maintained and the housekeeper was always on hand to assist if necessary. We have no complaints regarding noise from either inside or outside the hotel in the evenings. Whilst having a quiet drink in the bar a mouse appeared around my girlfriends feet. This was reported to the barman and he joked that it was probably the cheeseboard that attracted it. We took an hours tour on the hotel boat which was very pleasant and we were lucky enough to be the only couple. A nice trip but no narrative from the skipper. On the whole very good but not sure the staff treat all guest alike perhaps. Review #95:This was the best hotel I've stayed at in ages. The location is fantastic - close proximity to the centre of town yet amazingly tranquil. You enter into a courtyard currently filled with arty mosaic-covered benches and chaise longues. The reception staff were not only helpful bit also very easy on the eye! We were upgraded to a suite, which only enhanced the experience. Beds were fantastically comfortable. The shower and bath were brilliant. The only comment would be that some of the technology could do with some TLC.. the TV in the bath didn't work.. The concierge were fantastic. At very short notice they were able to conjure up a table at one of Amsterdam's popular bistro and cocktail bars without any fuss whatsoever. The bar, spa and restaurant (for breakfast) were up to scratch. Overall, this is a five star hotel that doesn't compromise and certainly lives up to the expectations of the Sofitel brand. If you're looking to treat a partner or celebrate a special event, I'd recommend a stay at The Grand. Review #96:This would be my choice for Amsterdam having stayed in most of the major hotels in this city over some 30 years. I must admit that I have yet to find a really good 5 star in this city. But it has a good location close to the Dam and about a 10 minute walk to the Central Station but it is a very, very touristy area. It needs, as of June 2007, some serious renovations in the rooms as they are slightly tired and could use an upgrade given it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating. Many different room type configurations, some better than others,so look at the room first. On the whole housekeeping is good as is room service, the Dutch breakfast in particular. On property restaurant is expensive and so so, nothing special, but there are any number of good eating establishments in the area, with my preference being for Indonesian. Review #97:i visited this hotel with my girlfriend on June 2nd for 3 days and had a great great time! they upgraded us to the William suite and offered great service all around , i specially want to thank Mauricio and Domingo who were our butlers and were of great assistance , i cannot recommend this hotel enough , if you want to visit Amsterdam and want a genuine 5 star experience look no further. other perks are great location, and the best in room dining you can ever taste! try there daily chocolate dessert and the 4 cheese pizza! to top it all of they have a horse carriage downstairs that can take you anywhere! Review #98:My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights at the start of November 2011. The staff were wonderful, really helpful, friendly and couldn't do enough to help us. They parked my husband's beloved car in a safe location, hired us some bikes to potter about on and recommended a few night spots, which were fantastic. The hotel was luxurious, very nicely furnished and had a non stuffy atmosphere. We had a decent sized room overlooking the canal on the 1st floor, but it was really quiet and comfortable. However, the best things that make this hotel great, are the staff and its location. Would recommend it to tourists or business travellers, you definitely won't be disappointed. Review #99:Pros: good location, impressive courtyard, courtious reception desk Cons: Concierge (both I dealt with) very rude and not at all helpful, rooms very dated in need of updating, Not worth the cost. I would stay around the corner at the Radisson SAS Hotel - much better experience overall.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

We were able to walk to just about every historic site and museum within 20 minutes. There are boundless cafe's and osteria's within minutes of the hotel. A main bus line is a two block walk. The plaza Navona, with a fabulous fountain is a 1-2 minute walk from the hotel where you can find numerous restarurants, cafe's, artists and beautiful fountains and evening entertainment. The plaza Farnese is 4 - 5 minute walk with a Wednesday farmers market that is fantistic. The Pantheon is just a 3-4 minute walk from the hotel where more cafe's, restaurants and entertainment await. My wife and I had never been to Rome, but we have traveled extensively over the years. We enjoy places that we can meet people and learn a bit more of the culture and history of places we visit. The owner of the Navona, Cory and his GM Michael were GREAT at providing us tips and insights within Rome. I love the fact that I saw the owner at the hotel every day talking with guests, staff and friends and doing all he could to make his customers feel a part of the city and the Hotel. We stayed at the Novona for 6 nights and we would stay there again. I feel that the price, services, location and assistance provided by the hotel staff met and exceeded our expectations. WE LOVE ROME! Review #1:We stayed at the Navona on the first week of our honeymoon (feb 27th to march 2nd). It was VERY clean, perfectly situated (within walking distance of most sites) AND the staff was SO FRIENDLY. We loved our stay there. I'd highly recommend it, even though the morning coffee is instant (which should be a crime in Italy!) Review #2:If you're familiar with European two-stars, you'll know what to expect here. The rooms and hotel were clean and comfortable, and breakfast was tasty. I thought the hotel was hard to find (and I never did quite figure out the surrounding streets) but the general location was good. The Piazza Navona is touristy but great fun. The beds were very small, and I think a large person would have difficulty with them. And it is indeed very noisy - I finally wore earplugs to block out the street noise. Review #3:This is not the fanciest hotel, but it was quite sufficient for our needs. A nice continental breakfast was included in the price and our room was clean and quiet. The main reason why you would stay here is the location. It's about a two minute walk away from both Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. The Vatican is about 20 minutes away, and the Spanish Steps and Fontana di Trevi are even closer. If you stay here, you can walk anywhere to see the main sights of Rome (unless you also want to see the catacombs, which I recommend...) There are plenty of good and inexpensive restaurants (around Piazza Navona you'll find the good and expensive ones) close to the hotel. If you are staying in Rome for a shorter period of time, you don't want to waste time on unnecessary transportation. Hence, Hotel Navona is a perfect choice for a long weekend in Rome. Review #4:Three of us stayed at the Hotel Navona and shared a room. It had two twins pushed together and a separate cot-like bed. We all found the room to be more than large enough and very comfortable. I slept on the cot-like bed and slept very well. Shower worked well. Our room was on a courtyard with a large, heavy oak door. You cannot beat the atmosphere and location. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Location, Location, Location! Review #5:I just returned from a one week stay at the Hotel Navona in Rome, where I thoroughly enjoyed what I believe was a true Roman experience. The LOCATION of this place is absolutely ideal, as it is within a few steps of Piazza San Eustaccio, where one can find the best coffee in the City; a few steps from the bus stop which delivers you from Termini Station; a few steps from the Piazza Navona, Romes greatest public space; a few steps from the Pantheon, Rome's oldest fully-intact temple to the gods. This is right where I wanted to be. As far as the negative reviews which complain about the size of the rooms being small, this is certainly true, but this is a small hotel in a very cool building several hundred years old, in an area of PRIME real estate. That character was what I was looking for. And the rooms were absolutely spotless. None of the other hotels where I would even consider staying in this excellent neighborhood (the rafael, albergo delsenato) are in this price range. And the staff were among the friendliest people I met in Rome. I will indeed be going back. Review #6:My husband and I spend 5 nights at Hotel Navona. What a great place! Our room was fabulous, spacious, clean, private. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. The location couldn't have been better, close to all Rome has to offer. Breakfast was ok, not exceptional, but suited us just fine. Room didn't have a phone and there was no access to the internet, but when you're on holiday...who needs it! Would stay there again in a heartbeat. Review #7:Hotel Navona has an excellent location and the price we paid (90 Euro per night for 6 nights) was excellent. On arrival the lady owner, we assume, asked us to pay cash and not by card as it was supposedly a special late booking offer! This was never mentioned 6 weeks before when we booked through an online agency! I refused and paid by card. Why would anyone be asked to pay by cash unless.......... Room was a bit dated but good character although a bit dusty. I'm not a big breakfast person and not a coffee aficionado but the coffee served was appalling and the diluted orange awful. The bread was nice though. As our stay coincided with the big Roma football (soccer) derby game I asked what the chances were of them obtaining tickets for us as you cannot purchase them online. I was told their local agent would obtain them for us. But alas this did not materialise and fortunately it proved quite easy to obtain them by ourselves as it was less than half full. For a base close to all the sights of beautiful Rome at an affordable price this hotel ticks all the boxes but don't expect anything more. There's plenty of great coffee shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Even though we have more negative than positive (hopefully constructive) criticism I would stay at this hotel again for the location and cost but skip brekkie and ignore the \"lack of\" service. Review #8:As other have testified the location is superb, but the hotel is well worth staying at for other reasons too. Newly decorated rooms in a very pretty historical building. We got our room through a Groupon offer and it was very good value. But what impressed us most was the fantastic service provided by the staff. Extremely attentive and friendly! And when we didn't know how to get to Roma Termini to catch the train to the airport, because Rome had had the first snowfall and ice in 30 years and no taxis were available, one of the staff offered to takes us there in his car and then promptly refused to accept any payment for this. We will certainly return to Hotel Navona. Thanks Michele and the rest of the staff! Review #9:I stayed at Hotel Navona for a week at the begining of September. It was clean and air conditioned. My room was very comfortable and I found the staff helpful. The location of the hotel was superb. Honestly, I cannot fault the hotel. The next time I visit Rome I will definately stay here. Review #10:First of all, I believe there is no better location in Rome. At Hotel Navona, you are right at the center, yet tucked away on a quiet street, taken care of by a warm, caring family. The rooms are clean, quiet, quaint, and comfortable. I remember a delicious dinner at Campo dei Fiori, followed by romantic digestivi at bar della pace, then being warmly welcomed back at the hotel, handed the key, then off to a super comfy bed... No wonder we're going back again this April! I've been going to Hotel Navona since 1985 (but that's another story...), I've recommended it to many friends, and they've all been very pleased to have stayed there. Review #11:We arrived at Hotel Navona and met the owner one evening, just before he was ready to leave for the day. The owner was very helpful in a difficult situation. He was willing to go out of his way to accomodate us. We thank him for being so friendly and kind on our first night in Rome! Cheers, mate! Review #12:We stayed at the Hotel Navona for 3 nights in November. Loved the location and loved the price! The room was small, but certainly adequate as was the service and the breakfast. We wanted to be near the Piazza Navona and this served our purposes. The hotel is convenient to all the sites. Actually we have just made reservations to stay there again next spring. The only down side would be the flight of stairs from the street to the hotel on the 1st floor, however, I just stayed with our luggage while my husband went up and ask that someone come down for all our bags. Breakfast is very basic and served in a room with tables lined up on either side of the room. As someone mentioned in one of the other reviews, if you're use to the Hilton and don't feel you can adjust, you probably should look elsewhere. Barbara89/ addedoomph@northstate.net Review #13:Our family stayed in two rooms that were clean and well-lighted. We both had a \"courtyard\" view but were happy since a clothesline was easily available. The staff was friendly and we enjoyed our continental breakfast very much. When we needed directions, or help, the staff assisted with a smile. A bonus was the fresh flowers at the front desk. To walk to Piazza Navona (and the lovely Bernini fountains) took us a mere two minutes. For a large city like Rome, to be in such a good location with a clean and serviceable room, Hotel Navona is the ticket. Bonus: the bottom floor has an ancient fountain and the whole place is built atop an ancient site. Get Cory to explain the hotel history. Many English speaking staff are available to assist. Review #14:Just returned from a stay at theHotel Navona...or should I say an apartment they owned on the Vittiore Emanuelle....a 10 minute walk away. The apartment was booked back in January by an Italian speaking friend, and a price was agreed .Hoever when we arrived there was some dispute over the agreed price and the elderly owner didnt care if we stayed or not. He demanded 20 euros a night more and cash up front.Unable to resolve the issues,wWe proceeded to the apartment...very spacious but very basic.The sheets were darned and had holes in them!! The kitchen had an odd array of chipped crockery and two saucepans that I refused to use as they were so disgusting.The management did agree to change the sheets but as for the kitchen we were told was to be used\" only in emergencies\" and we could go to the hotel for brakfast .....We went to breakfast twice and decided to buy elsewhere as it really wasnt worth the 10 minute walk each morning. At the end of our stay we paid the original agreed fee as we dealt with Cory who remembered the original conversation back in Jan and was very kind and helpful...it was such a pity that the older man and the sour faced woman werent as obliging. Dont think I would make a return to the Navona Interesting to see no one else who has left comments seems to have stayed in the apartment!! ! Review #15:This was our first trip to Italy and we booked Hotel Navona because of Foder's recommendation. After booking the hotel, I read all the reviews and was very worried about going. We were so pleasantly surprised. It's like a cozy bed and breakfast in a perfect location. We walked everywhere and felt totally safe where the hotel is located. Piazza Navona is a perfect location and the hotel is one block from the Piazza. Our room was exactly like the photo online and it was clean and quiet. The pillows left something to be desired, but the bed was comfortable. The bath was clean and the shower had wonderful hot water. We would recommend bringing your own washcloths and soap because the soap was very tiny and there were great towels, but no washcloths. Breakfast was our biggest surprize. After reading the reviews from some, we thought it would be bad. We had wonderful cappuchino each morning and a pot of tea, orange juice, yogurt and the best fresh baked rolls with butter and jelly. There were also packaged cakes if you needed more. Breakfast was lovely and the staff remembered our choice of drink each day. All in all it was great and we would definitely stay there again. We didn't expect a large hotel and very much like the quaint atmosphere. The staff was helpful and pleasant also. Review #16:After reading some previous reviews I was expecting a bare bones room, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was nicely decorated, we were at the end of a hall so very quiet too. Great location, we walked everywhere, one day to the Forum, another to the Vatican. You can't beat this location, and for the room rates in Rome, I thought this was a pretty good deal. Review #17:I recently stayed 4 days here with 17 boys and 13 parents. The hotel staff put up with a lot. They were pleasant, always there to help, and got up a 1/2 hour early every day to serve us breakfast. Our last night we left @ 3am.. Our bags were carried to the curb (all of them). Mike had a gift for everyone. While this is not a luxury hotel, it was pleasant , close to everything, clean and the showers worked fine. The Piazza Eustachio is right around the corner (best Cappuccino in Rome). All the locals go here. You are close to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona. Incidentally, The Piazza Navona is named after this hotel (or family). Mike will set you straight on this. Enjoy your stay in Rome. I did.. Review #18:We recently stayed at the hotel Navona located just off of the Piazza Navona wich was the perfect location to walk to so many of the famous sights in Rome.The most friendly staff welcomed us and were very helpful with all of the questions we had. The room was very spacious and immaculate with windows that opened to the street below with flowerboxes framing them all. The charm and old world feeling we felt was something that truely added to to our Rome experience!!!! ! Review #19:Premise: I work for an airline and have traveled a lot and stayed in all classes of hotels. This hotel is located just off of via renascimento, 1 small block from Piazza Navona and 1 block from Via Vittorio Emmanuelle. The location is excellent. Walking distance to EVERYTHING: pantheon, trevi, spanish steps, colloseum, jewish quarter, campo di fiori, etc, etc. For that alone this is a great choice. However, the hotel is 1 step up from a pensione... it is located on the 2nd floor of an apartment building with no elevator. The room was sufficient and we had our own bathroom. The water strenth was excellent. There was a little tv with basic cable, so CNN and Italian channels. We had room number 19. There were cobwebs on the tops of the curtains. There were also some funky birds that habitated on the roof of the building and they sounded like a pack of dogs...I think they were shape changers =) they were very loud and scary at night! The breakfast was nothing to write home about. American coffee and some danish in plastic. But it was sufficient. Especially since there were no real coffee bars near enough to enjoy..so it did the trick. For the price, the location makes this a good choice. I love to be near campo di fiori...such a great ambience both during the day with the markets and at night with the restaurants and bars. In my travels I got to see Hotel Raphael and Hotel Campo di Fiori. Both of which are in EXCELLENT locations and look really nice. In retrospect I wish that we had stayed in one of those 2. Enjoy! Review #20:We booked this hotel for a family of 9 hoping that it would live up to previous positive comments on tripadvisor. It more than lived up to them, the location is ideally located 2minutes walk from piazza navona, 5 mins from the pantheon and 10mins from the spanish steps. The staff were very friendly and welcoming (in particular Michele), they gave us great recommendations for restaurants and places to see. Excellent value for money. Review #21:The Hotel Navona was a pleasant spot which we enjoyed. At a great price on a very cute street, we spent three nights there. The staff were very friendly and breakfast was included. I would definitely recommend it to travelers to Rome looking for a nice, but not luxury spot. We would stay there again. The bathroom was small, but so are most bathrooms in Italy. The room was comfortable and not noisy. Review #22:We have been staying at this hotel for two decades, and have marveled at the numerous improvements that the family owners have made across the board. Rooms have been thoughtfully and tastefully renovated, the breakfasts have improved in quantity and quality (ok, their coffee isn't great, but you have the finest caffe in Rome just around the corner in the Piazza San Eustachio), and the staff are kind and knowledgeable. Treat them with courtesy and respect, and you'll be treated similarly. We like the fact that this hotel is large enough to accommodate individual and groups in different wings of its large Borromini palace, and keeps noise down to a minimum by insisting that guests be considerate. If only they could regulate the occasional street revelers outside! - but that's the cost of a central location, I guess. Perhaps their next improvement to the rooms will be better double glazing? For now, the rooms have flat screen TVs, individual a/c units and safes, and en suite bathrooms. Review #23:Once you recover from the front desk being on the first floor and having to drag your bags up yourself our room was lovely. Out of some antique picture book and much larger than we expected. it was in the corner of the building was great as it was resonably hot and air conditioning didn't work. Problem was floor was filthy and we needed to were socks. Also our fridge was broken so we couldn't even put water in to cool. Location wise hotel is within walking distance to all of Romes sites. Easy walk to Vatican, Coluseum and Borgia gallery. It's surrounded by lovely resteraunts and a supermarket is about 3 min walk. I'd recomend a gps unit as streets are small and getting lost is easy. Help from staff stopped once we paid which was on arrrival but at least the internet worked. Review #24:The service was, well the worst i've ever experienced! There was some who worked there who where forthcomming and helpfull - but I never felt welcome and was spoken to in an extreamly unfriendly and threthening way several times during the 3 days i stayed. The rooms are ok, small bathrooms. The location is central, walking distance to many interesting places in Rome. Review #25:Nothing can beat this family run hotel. There is a real pleasure to be treated practically like family when you stay and I am a repeat customer. The building is as charming as the street it is located on. Minutes from all site in the historic sector, yet quiet and intimate. I just can't imagine a better place to stay for someone coming to Rome for the first time, or for returning again and again. It's a wonderful hotel! Review #26:Basically, the only positives about this hotel is the central location around the corner from the Pantheon & the staff was friendly and helpful. The room & bathroom was dirty. Our bathroom had a long odd hallway to the toilet/shower which was very tight. the only silver-lining here is that the price was right. Review #27:I spent a week in this hotel in the spring of 2004. I should have heeded the warnings on this site. Anytime a hotel insists on cash in advance, it is not a good sign. The room was uncomfortable:cramped, noisy and dirty. The worst part was dealing with the contemptuous and unhelpful staff and owners. You can do much better. Keep looking. Review #28:The hotel is well situated but besides that it was expensive :Euros180 per night even though the guidebooks price it as moderate. I asked specifically for a quiet room and received precisely the opposite: traffic and pedestrian noise all night long. The bathroom stank to high heaven and the beds were not comfortable. The breakfast was worse than a McDonalds fast food experience. Cheap, packaged croissant, cheap cereals - nothing to write home about here. Overall I would say this is probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed in on holidayand I am not extremely fussy! The staff were friendly and accommodating although they did not accept a credit card and wanted cash or trveller's cheques in Euros only. A waste of money and would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #29:Like many other reviewers point out, this hotel is in a good, central location. But it wasn't all that pleasant a place to stay. I am a bit picky about decor and found our room to be charmless bordering on depressing. If it was cheaper, I'd feel fine recommending it as a budget option. But at over $200/night, I suspect there are better hotels at a similar price. We only stayed there one night because the apartment we were renting wasn't available until the next day, and I have to say that I'm very glad our stay at this hotel was short. In addition to the lackluster feel of our room, the woman at the front desk was somewhat unpleasant. My husband and I are independent travelers and don't tend to depend on hotel staff for much, but she seemed so put upon even when we asked basic questions about the hotel, such as how to use the lobby phone or what they offered for breakfast. We really didn't like dealing with her. This was our second trip to Rome. We had a great time and will probably return again. Our first stay was at Hotel Campo de' Fiori, which I highly recommend (I wrote a review for it two years ago). Unfortunately, it was booked during our stay this year, but we'll definitely aim to stay there on our next visit. Review #30:The hotel is on the first floor of an old building which smelt badly. Despite having booked and paid the first night's stay many months prior, we were shown to a small drab room. For example, access to the shower required stepping over the toilet. There was one single wardrobe. No drawer space. We asked where our shirts etc could be placed and were advised to use the single shelf which also contained the little safe. No other rooms were available that night so we \"walked\" and obtained a hotel elsewhere. Returning the next day to get our money back involved an unpleasant exchange with either the manager or owner. A very poor introduction to Roman hospitality. Review #31:This hotel is just off Piazza Navona. It is difficult to find in taxi so make sure you have a map. It is clean and basic accommodation. This is not luxury by any means. It is a good base for sight seeing and walking distance to all tourist attractions. Our room was cleaned daily and the room was also quiet. The breakfast is nothing to write home about! It is coffee and a packaged croissant. Better to eat out. Cheap and cheerful and a base for sightseeing - stay here. Looking for luxury - look elsewhere. Review #32:I stayed two nights in Navona - in a tiny single room. Its a nice, clean hotel with great staff that speak English quite well. We all stayed on the main floor which is one flight of stairs up from the street level. I don't recall if they had an elevator, but I don't think so. Very basic breakfast offered. I stayed there with friends and it was during the bus strike and a national demonstration. We ended up walking much of the two days we were there, which was fine because Navona is not too far from the Vatican (about a 15-20 minute walk). Its very close to the Pantheon and there is some good shopping and great restaurants not too far away. Our last night, we ate at a wonderful little trattoria (Tritone, on Via Tritone) about 5 minutes from the Spanish Steps as the owner (or friend of the owner) stopped us on the street and invited us to have dinner with him. It was absolutely wonderful. Our best meal throughout our time in Italy! We walked back to the hotel because we were stuffed. Everything was great in Rome, too bad we didn't have more time. Review #33:We highly recommend the Hotel Navona in Rome. It\u2019s centrally located, in the heart of ancient Rome, just a couple blocks from the Piazza Navona and the Pantheon (not to mention that it\u2019s about a block away from one of the best espresso cafes in all of Rome). Also, public transportation to wherever you want to go is right around the corner. It's a very well-run hotel. The owners and staff were warm and welcoming, and also very helpful in sharing their thorough knowledge of the area. A special thank you to Cory, Patricia, Michele, and Farouk! CAUTION: There is only one Hotel Navona, not to be confused with hotels using similar names\u2014to be safe, contact the hotel directly at www.hotelnavona.com. Our room was a Double Superior, which was spacious, clean, and very comfortable (not to mention quiet!). It was an excellent value for the money. The staff served a traditional Italian breakfast every morning (included in the room price). We really enjoyed the yogurt, rolls/croissants, coffee/cappuccinos, juice, and friendly service. If you\u2019re not used to breakfast in Italy, please know that this one is quite good, without having to pay extra\u2014contributing to the value of the hotel. (For reference, if you\u2019re looking for a large American-style buffet breakfast, the larger hotels offer them for somewhere between $35 and $50 per person.) We were referred to Hotel Navona by a relative we totally trust, and now we would recommend it to our closest friends. Based on our positive experience, we fully intend to stay there on our next trip to Rome. Review #34:All of the staff at this hotel are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They will take the time to assist you with just about any request you have. The hotel is perfectly situated for an unbelievable walking tour of Rome. I have stayed in other hotels in the city, and I can say without hesitation, Hotel Navona combines the best of all you are looking for, location, price, value for the money, hospitality, cleanliness, and local knowledge. Review #35:The hotel is located in a great area, as we walked to Vacatican and up to Spanish Steps, Roman Ruins. All is there with many small streets with loads of places to eat and at all price ranges. The rooms were clean and bathrooms were exceptionally clean. Only negatives were the breakfast which is coffee and a roll but enough to get you going and staff can be distant. We were locked out one night as there is no central key given for the main area (hotel is located on third floor of large building) and ended up staying with our friend who lives in Rome that night, and we were not aware that we would not be able to get back into the hotel. If you want a good place to rest your head and not have to worry about taxis, buses, or underground, this is the place. We only took a taxi to and from the train station when we arrived and left. I would stay there again. Of course if you need American standards of large rooms and a full breakfast then this is not the place for you. Review #36:My family and I had an opportunity to spend two weeks in Rome and chose the Hotel Navona through the recommendation of a friend. In short, our expectations were exceeded and our trip was a resounding success due in large part to the hotel accommodations and its staff. The location is second-to-none with short walks to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona and Campo de' Fiorie. Excellent restaurants are close by and you're just a block from the best espresso in Italy at the Sant Eustachio il Caff\u00e9. We were first timers in Rome and appreciated the assistance of the multi-lingual hotel staff in getting directions and recommendations of sites to visit. Rooms were exceptionally clean and well kept. We were there in the hottest part of the year and appreciated the well running air conditioning. All around the Hotel Navona is an excellent choice for your visit to Rome! Review #37:Spent 7 nights, with a party of 5 (2 rooms). Very attractive, but small. Showers in my room were good. Great office staff, very helpful and good English, but the waiters in the \"breakfast\" room were a little stiff... Breakfast was poor... we ended up eating elsewhere... packaged hard rolls, bad coffee, and they guarded you like a hawk for fear you'd take a cup with you to your room. Dining area was very small, with crowded tables in a corridor like setting... Also disappointed that there was no place to sit, either a terrace, living room (except for the 4 formal chairs right by the checkin desk), and no chairs in the rooms (probably not enough room for them!). Also had a thin wall, unusual for such an old building, and heard every word from the room next door, often in the middle of the night. However, you can't beat the location and the bed was extremely comfortable. Review #38:We spent about 3 weeks recently in one of Hotel Navona's Apartments (because of the length of our stay). We took breakfast nearly every day at the Hotel and we interacted with the staff re help navigating around town on our own, about buses, tours, banking, restaurants and many other services, all of which they cordially provided. We were in and out of the Hotel at all times of the day and were completely satisfied with everyone we encountered. The owner was present a lot of the time, and we found him to be uniformly pleasant and concerned about our stat. We feel Hotel Navona is a Roman experience not to be missed --- Yes, you haul your luggage up one flight, but help is always available to you. Breakfast with fresh rolls and pots of hot coffee and milk are fine, and yogurt and orange juice and sometimes meat and cheese and fruit round out this good start to the day. The breakfast staff is exceptionally good, sometimes working under extreme pressure when a number of people came in to eat all at once, and they responded to all guests' requests and needs quickly and willingly. We interacted with and asked many questions of all the staff, and they responded to to our enthusiasm about being in Rome with carefully thought-out answers, help and advice. Delivery men bring in fresh linens and food right through the lobby. One is part of the action. The Hotel is in an old palazzo and thankfully retains much of the original feel. It is clean, fun and very Roman. The location is simply ideal. But don't stay here if you want a ritzy hotel with American ambiance. Stay here because it captures Roman hospitality. Don't come here unless you want to sit down with Germans, Brits, Danes and American students and swap stories. Do come here if you want a jumping-off place to Rome, managed by people who try sincerely to match your wishes and needs to yous dreams. We were entirely happy with our choice of hotels. We will definitely stay here again. Review #39:I stayed at this location while solo traveling in Rome, Italy. It was conveniently located near Piazza Navona, which is within walking distance of all the major sites in Rome. The hotel is closer to Vatican City - my main focus while traveling in Rome. For the cost I stayed in a very clean, comfortable, and classy room with a simple breakfast. Internet was not easily accessible, which was a bit of an annoyance, but not a major deal for me. Review #40:In summary if you are not looking for great American style luxury and would like to be at the center of all Roman sites and nightlife Hotel Navona is a great affordable option. Rooms are spacious ( for European standards), quite and super clean. The hotel is on a quiet alley which is very important as Romans are up till late hours wondering in the streets. The breakfast was continental style, just some bread, juice, coffee to get you started. The hotel is on the second floor and there are no elevators but you may ask someone to help you with the luggage. The Corso Rinascimento ( a big street) is just 2 blocks away and there you can catch a bus to the Train Station and Colosseum. Pantheon, Fontana de Trevi and Spanish Steps are walking distance. The Vatican is about 10 min by bus. The taxi from the bus station costs us 25 euros but the bus the hotel recommends ( i think 42...) takes you just 2 blocks from the hotel. Check on their website and on google maps for more information on that. Have fun!! Ah, if you stay here make sure to try The bakery cinque Lune on Corso rinascimento 89, they have the best pastries I had in Rome! Review #41:Loved the Hotel Navona. We found the staff friendly and most helpful after my husband was robbed at Rome train station! They called the embassy, taxis, etc . for us and did what they could. Room was comfortable and clean with a/c. No TV, but that wasn't a problem for us. Breakfast was basic and Italian style...just good coffee and brioche/bread, but I was happy with this, and if you're not, there are great cafes within minutes of the hotel, which has one of the very best loctions in Rome. If you don't want to spend a fortune, want a good location, and are happy with a small, no-frills hotel, I recommend the Hotel Navona. Review #42:I stayed here with my finacee and a group of friends. Great location but we had several issues with the Hotel. Although my finacee and I booked a double room it consisted of two single beds pushed together. The room was also small and dark. The breakfast was not worth bothering with - only stale bread and instant coffee. The staff were pretty unhelpful as well. We booked a taxi for a certain time to take us to the airport. We waited in the Hotel reception for the taxi. After half an hour it had still not arrived despite the receptionist promising every five minutes that \"it will be here in five minutes\". Then receptionist then got up and left when his shift was over despite our taxi still not having arrived. He was totally blase about the whole thing. Luckily the taxi arrived shortly afterwards and we just made our flight in time. All this and the Hotel wasnt particularly cheap. We loved Rome and would definitely go back but will be staying somewhere else next time. Review #43:Only two positives: large shower and location. Although the shower was large, the room was definitely not. There was a lot of street noise. The staff is not accomodating. It's as if you are bothering them if you need some information. The woman who works there didn't smile once. The staff and owners seemed annoyed to have guests! Not sure what kind of coffee was served at breakfast -- not caffe latte or cappacino and not quite American. A big disappointment for the money. Review #44:For my wife's 30th birthday I arranged a trip to Rome and a stay in the Hotel Navona. As a surprise I invited another 11 couples so there were 24 of us in total. I was a little aprehensive of arranging such an event and if the hotel was not up to scratch I would never live it down. I arranged my trip with Micheal on reception who was very efficient and even booked a restaurant for us. The rooms where very adequate for the visit and everyone in our party though that the hotel offered a fantastic location and a certain rustic charm. I read some reviews from Americans mainly complaining about the room sizes etc and I have to state that you dont get 5 star service unless you pay for it. Everyone in our group agreed that they would use it again and I am looking forward to. Review #45:Perfectly located in Historical Center just 2 minute walk from Piaza Navona and bus to Vatican and Termini Station. Stayed here about 4 years ago and place seems the same but a little more faded and could do with a lick of paint. Rooms are quite dingy. Breakfast is still a bland 'long life' croissant with a few other bits. Prices in Rome have gone up for everything. Small beer on Piaza Navona was 7 Euros!. 70 Euros for Taxi from airport so you are best to pre-book taxi on internet or take train Rome does not have to be expensive as we discovered when we had the most enjoyable and affordable drinks in a bar followed by a perfect meal in a restaurant in Travestere. Review #46:We were booked in the Hotel Navona in March 2011. We were greeted by open garbage in the lower floor \"lobby\", scaffolding and ladders and other dangerous items, poor directions to the 2nd floor where the registration desk is found. We were billed for the full 7 days/7 nights on our credit card more than a month before our travel. After being in our room for less than 15 minutes, to find no security, mould in our shower, and a general uneasiness regarding the staff that followed us, we made arrangements to move to another hotel. Internet service was available - but I was \"escorted\" to a small room and staff stayed behind me while I used it. While trying to check out... we were screamed at and we could not understand what they were saying to us. Language was an issue, but screaming in any language is offensive. We finally just walked out, given we had a taxi waiting. Once in Canada, we attempted to get at least a portion of our money back - to no avail. They said that we did not check out properly - and would not refund one cent of $1400+ Euros. I wanted to sign something - but they wouldn't help me, and the screaming was more than we were willing to listen to... Our safety was more important to us.... it was worth LEAVING. Our new hotel, was fabulous, and made the trip to Rome what it was supposed to be... a beautiful city, with a rich history. Review #47:Hotel Navona is located nearby Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. You have walking distance to most sceneries and on top of that a lot of small restaurants in the neighbourhood with reasonable prices and good food. The hotel is small but very tidy, our room was small but had everything we needed including nice beds and the staff was kind and very helpful. Definitely value for money and we will recommend our friends to stay here! Review #48:Dont expect too much from this hotel. The rooms are basic and i would say ideal for group travel. Breakfast is simple but nice & filling and keeps you going - Euro breakfast. You can grab more food/coffee around Piazza Navona and other areas if you want. Ideal location! Review #49:Stayed for a few days on a Rome trip, trying to keep costs down at the time. For that purpose, this hotel is a great choice. Details... THE GOOD --Very reasonable price - at the time in 2003 it was about $120USD per night --Fantastic location, walking distance to everything (near Piazza Navona) --Accomodations reasonable THE BAD: --Small rooms --Iffy service --Accomodations are very simple, unrefined --Bathroom was tiny If you are trying to see Rome on a budget, this is a great spot. If you are going luxury, don't bother. Review #50:Well located, quiet, clean hotel. Much too expensive. Breakfast terrible. We were asked to leave after complaining. And we did. Also fire exits were blocked by breakfast tables. When we pointed this out we were told they would be moved in the morning! After insisting they were pushed a little to one side but still hampered access to the fire exit. Review #51:The location is the only redeeming feature of this hotel. Other reviewers have noted that the entrance is one the second floor which truly is a hassle if you have a large and/or heavy bag, and there is certainly no one there to help you. The room was grungy and depressing, just generally worn down. The television had about 5 channels. The staff was either hard to find or not particularly friendly and the breakfast they provided came with neither service nor taste. There are many hotels to choose from in Rome, I recommend not choosing this one. Review #52:We stayed at the Hotel Navona's sister hotel; Residenza Zanardelli. The location is a few minutes walk from Piazza Navona, a brilliant location with lots going on at night. The hotel is clean and has good air conditioning but there is nothing else good we can say about this place. The staff were very unfriendly and in fact acted liked we were bothering them on each occasion we passed them. We had amended our reservation since the time of booking and the hotel had no record of this. Despite saying we could pay on check on we were asked to pay midway through our stay. The shower was also a dribble of hot water. The breakfast is at one table with all the hotel guests sitting around it. We had booked a double room but the double bed was in fact two single beds pushed together. For the communial breakfast alone, we would not recommend this hotel. We will definitiely go back to Rome but will give this hotel a miss. Review #53:I just returned from 5 wonderful nights in Rome and I would highly recommend the Hotel Navona to anyone looking for a good value in a great location. It is located right between Piazza Navona and the Pantheon, surrounded by lots of great restaurants and interesting little shops. As a woman traveling alone, I felt very safe and I found the neighborhood to be more affordable and less trafficky than others I visited in Rome. The bed was more comfortable than it looked (it was kind of a flimsy looking mattress) and the room was small, but I expected that. It was very clean and bright, which made up for the small size. The breakfast is good by Rome standards, but if you're expecting eggs & bacon, you won't find it. I had yogurt, OJ, hot tea and a roll and found it was enough to keep me until lunch. One thing to be prepared for about this hotel is that you have to go up two flights of stairs just to get to the front desk. If you have a lot of luggage, this could be hard. Also, it can be a little noisy outside, especially if you're trying to nap in the middle of the day. At night, it wasn't as noisy. I didn't rely on the front desk for much, but they were able to arrange a taxi back to the airport that arrived exactly on time, which was greatly appreciated. Overall, I had a great time and would highly recommend Hotel Navona to anyone looking for a phenomenal deal in the best neighborhood in Rome. Review #54:Hotel Navona is in perfect location if you want to walk around touristic places in Rome. Pantheon is ohh so near from here. The Hotel is in a nice quite bylane, though turn the corner and you can enjoy finest caffee at Sant Eustachio (ask Caffee banco - on the bank, if you don't want to cough up 4 Euros for a latte). Owners are very nice, were very friendly with us and our younger son. Breakfast, as some other reviewer said, is ordinary, though there are lots of places where you can fill yourself up before you start off your day. Room has a safe locker which helps - Rome has loads of theives, so be careful with your stuff. No problem what so ever with Shower, though they could not get the cooler started - it was hot on 5th April. One thing I would like to mention is the lady staff overquoted the taxi fare to Ciampino Airport on the day of departure. She quoted 50 EUR and when I let her know what I paid 30 on the way from airport to their hotel, she revised the fare to 35 EUR. That was little dishonest I think. Apart from this, this place was wonderful to stay and explore Rome by foot. Oh, and I want t o mention about thisPizzeria (not on tourist radar) that just makes us go gaga over it. Name is Pasquales Pizzeria its on Via dei Prefetti. Family run, frequented by locals and his daily customers, the pizzas are delicious and so is their home grown vine. Review #55:This is a very good option for staying in Rome. Location is very good, rooms are clean and spacious, breakfast can at least get you going and the staff....well....just remember you are not there to socialize. I am sure their ratings would be way better if they were a bit friendlier. I would stay here again . An excellant value for the money. Review #56:If you wanna stay in a nice quiet hotel which is clean and cheap with great service, this hotel is perfect for you. First and foremost thou are the location location location. Located a stonethrow from piazza Navona you have easy walking distance to millions of restaurants, shopping, the pathenon, the trevi fountain etc etc. And both the vatican and the colloseum is only a 10-15 min walk away. The rooms themself are not the biggest, but they are very clean, and have nice showers/toilets, a good size bed and the daily service is good. There is an easy to use safe, and if you ask, you can get a room with nice working and quiet aircon. The staff is divided into 2 groups. The main receptionists are friendly and very helpful and speaks fluid english. The bellboys and waiters are reserved and not very helpful. There are only 2 downsides we could think of. There is a lot of stairs and small corridors, so not a very good choiche for disabled people, and the breakfast is realy just a piece of bread and some wrapped pastry. But we didnt mind since we eat breakfast on the move mostly. So in short - if were going to Rome again were gonna stay here 100% and were gonna recomend the place to all friends. Review #57:My wife and I bring fifteen to eighteen students to Italy every summer. We need a place in Rome for five days/nights that is accessible to the major sites and has a reasonable cost. Hotel Navona fits the bill for us. The clean rooms are cozy and have an old world feel about them. Great flat screen tv's have satellite coverage. The staff, Mike especially, along with the wonderful Natale family have been so helpful to us. On our last stay one of our students came down with a peculiar illness and after a visit to the hospital they all took such great concern for our young man; going so far as to make soup for him (Thank you, Mama Tina) and later on some homemade spaghetti (Thank you, Mike). I left my phone in a taxi and they helped me locate it. A great place to stay in the center of historic Rome, Hotel Navona has our return business. Review #58:We stayed one night at Hotel Navona and one night at the Residenza Zanardelli and enjoyed both hotel (same owner). The Zanardelli is a bit more upmarket with more attention to the furnishing details, however the room we had at the Navona Hotel was more spacious and quiter. The Zanardelli Residence is on the first floor of this amazing XIX century building whereas the Navona Hotel is in a less sumptuos buiding, but with a lovely courtyeard in the middle. Both hotels could do more of an effort with their breakfast service. Both hotels are extermely conveniently located. Review #59:We were two senior couples looking to explore Rome on foot. We don't require 4 or 5 star luxury at outrageous prices. Hotel Navona provided an excellant location with clean utilitarian rooms at reasonable cost. Breakfast was coffee, rolls, juice, yogurt, etc. Less than what Americans are used to but more than adequate considering the marvelous lunches, dinners, gellatto, etc. we ate every day elsewhere. We had no street noise issues. The one negative is its 1st floor (not ground) location and no elevator. The staff was very friendly and helpful especially Michael who seemed to live in the lobby. He was always there and extremely helpful. Review #60:The hotel is in a great central location and is in easy walking distance of all the major attraction of Rome. It was generally clean and our room on the top floor was small but comfortable. The only downside was the shower curtain had seen better days. Breakfast was simple; 1 large bread roll with condements, packaged crossant and good dark coffee, but that set you up well for the morning and a easy lunch on the street. For dinner there are some very good restaurants on the other side for Piazza Navona down Via di Tor Milina. Review #61:The Hotel Navona was not what I expected at first, but after a few minutes of peeking around and meeting the staff while checking in, I knew that this is the only place I want to stay when in Rome. The owner and staff were so very friendly and knowledgable. The owner talked to my family and friends for over half an hour about the buildings history, his family, his life, and about the city. We learned so much. The rooms were super clean, and the beds amazingly comfortable! It was exactly what I needed after the flight! They only offer breakfast, but large groups can ask about possible dinner options. Again, the staff was just wonderful. It is a little off the beaten path, but it was easy to walk to all the major sites. It was tucked away down a little street which meant it was nice and quiet. When I go back to Rome in a few years, I already know I want to stay there for location, comfort, and the hospitality. Review #62:My wife and I just stayed at this hotel with 2 friends for several nights. It is in a great location in the center of Rome. The Pantheon and the Piazza Navona are just a few minutes walk away. You are very close to lots of food and shopping. The price was excellent for being in the center of Rome in season. The rooms were clean and roomy. The hotel staff was very good. Mike and the hotel owner were great and helped us with any reservations and ideas for outings that we needed. A simple breakfast comes with the room, bread, juice, coffee/tea, but if you are looking for something more you will need to go out. This is not a luxery hotel with alot of amenities, but if you are looking for a great location, clean quiet rooms at a good price, this is a great choice. Review #63:Hotel Navona is located just steps away from Piazza Navona. Rooms are small, but that is normal. Prices were very reasonable for the area. The negative: very noisy. The street the hotel is on is loaded with mopeds that seem to come and go all through the night. Before 6 am people are in the street yelling, and the mopeds are coming and going. Ask for a room overlooking the small courtyard if possible. Or, better still, ask for a room in their other hotel Rezidenza Zandarelli, located near the Piazza Navona, only at the opposit end. No elevator, and with 3-4 flights of steps to climb 3-4 times a day...you'll get a workout. No internet in the rooms, only the lobby and you are free to use the breakfast room for WiFi. Breakfast was fine. The standard bread rolls, and cornetto. Coffee was terrible....I know, I couldn't believe it either. I think they try to serve American style coffee by brewing espresso, and adding water, but they would do better to offer the espresso. Bathroom was a good size, with a tub/shower combo that was fine. Hairdryer worked well. Review #64:We stayed in a two bedroomed apartment just round the corner from the hotel and it suited us very well. The staff and manager were very helpful and friendly. We were taken for a coffee by the manager and he told us a lot about the area and the building. The hotel represents excellent value for money (we paid less than 50 euros each per night) and is perfectly located. The bedrooms in the apartment were spacious, well furnished, the beds were comfortable and the water was hot! We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others and am sure we will stay here next time we are in Rome. Review #65:Having booked this hotel on reccommendation from a hotel inspector (I work in the industry), I was then horrified to read the reviews on this site. Without reading the reviews I would have been disaapointed with the hotel, however I dont think the hotel is as bad as some of these reviews may hint. The biggest selling point is location - Piazza Navona is perfect with traders and many pizzerias, Vatican is 15 mins walk as are the Spanish steps. The hotel is more of a b&b. I guess your stay would depend on what room you had as all are different. Ours was small but clean, so we were happy going out all day and just crashing out overnight. Staff werent rude, no more than any other hotel we stayed in - we had hot water problems and they ensured it was fixed within minutes. On our last night we paid \u00a350 more and stayed at the Mecenate Palace, staff were terrible but worth the \u00a350 extra Review #66:A friend and I stayed at the hotel this year for five nights and found it perfectly located for all of the places we wanted to visit. We loved the inside/outside stairway - it just added to the fun. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We had to cancel our first planned visit due to a bereavement and the hotel immediately sent their condolences and offered to transfer our stay to a later date. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay somewhere with character and charm that'll put them on the doorstep of so many Roman wonders! Review #67:great value considering the FANTASTIC location nestled between piazza navona and the pantheon (each a 1-2 minute walk away !) plus the vatican, trevi fountain, spanish steps, trastevere and colosseum/forum are EACH within a 20 min leisurely walk. Rooms, ameneties, breakfast are fair (not great) but for the price, to get better in that location you would have to pay close to double the price and the rooms will likely not be any bigger as all the buildings in the historic center are, of course, centuries old. At least their rooms are very clean. English is spoken by the mostly non-italian staff and they are quite friendly. I have stayed there twice now and the latest time, the room was tiny but the shower-head strength(on an upper floor) was amazing ...and hot ! (a real luxury in Rome where many homes, hotels do not have showerheads and you have to hold the hose ...a real pain. Again, a real good deal if location is paramount and you' re not looking for \"american\" style comforts and room size. I grew up in Rome a few blocks away from there and the location (for a tourist) cannot be beat ! hig Review #68:This is a charming little hotel right in the historic district two steps away from the Plaza Navona and an easy walk to the Forum and the Coliseum .There is a lot to see and places to eat nearby . There are excellent bus connections nearby that can take you there also and to the shopping, St Peter's cathedral area and most anywhere else. The building dtes from the 1400's and the rooms are modern but small. The whole place is cosy. The breakfast which is included is European style, breads, juice and coffee and some sliced meats and cheese. We found the staff very helpful and accommodating. Review #69:This hotel is situated in a perfect location for walking and sightseeing. However, the rooms were loud and the staff was apathetic and not friendly. In fact the owner was boderline rude and certainly arrogant. Although the location for the price was good, we would not stay here again. Review #70:We have stayed at Hotel Navona for four years in a row when we bring college students to Rome for a class. Our experience with this hotel has been exemplary. The front desk service is extremely helpful, making transportation arrangements for airports and field trips. They go out of their way to supply maps, early morning breakfast, and even making soup for a sick student. The double rooms are perfect for our needs with good showers, large flat screen TV's, and Wifi. The rooms are clean and charming with the ceiling of our room even painted with fresco's. And, of course, the location is the best, being only 2 minutes from the Pantheon and Piazza Navona and a 15 minute walk to St. Peter's and the Roman Forum. The Natale family, owners of the hotel, take a personal interest in making this a hospitable and enjoyable stay. It is truly a family hotel with the personal touches of people who care. We will happily continue to stay at this hotel each year. Emily Ivey Review #71:If location primes OK otherwise: noise with the windows closed, you can hera a hairpin drop in the street, and as your in central rome, the quiet moments to hear hairpins drop are rare. ugly: neither old nor new, a copy of old done on the cheap uncomfortable: the pillows could be cofortably repalced by wooden head rests, the mattress is best left unqua lified unpleasant: I read a review saying they disliked american. I spoke only unaccented French and it did not improve the service. The bathroom: I have seen better in youth hostels: from low pressure to raspy towels, and two people can not fir in too brush their teeth together Breakfast, Ha breakfast... we chose not to brake the fast.. Avoid if you intend to sleep., OK to store your bags in central rome. Review #72:If you need a place with a grand lobby and multiple servants to tip everytime a door opens, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a wonderfully comfortable room in a quiet, antique location, and you want a true Roman experience, with a wealth of incredible restaurants in the vicinity, please check out this hotel. Very clean and friendly Pension. We had a large room with four beds, and were very comfortable. Continental breakfast included, is served quickly and has a nice variety. Situated one block from Piazza Navona, and easily within walking distance to the Capitola, the Pantheon, the Spanish Steps, the Forum, and even the Colosium, you cannot beat the location. We were there for the celebration of the Epiphany and Rome was buzzing with people and toy Befanas everywhere. The owner, Corey (Corrado) speaks fluent English, as does most of his staff. Their site: http://www.hotelnavona.com Review #73:This hotel was recommended by neighbor who stayed here several times. We had a great time here. Location is great, along quiet street, staff and proprietor are very helpful and easy going people. It was nice having breakfast in hotel before our daily long walks exploring Rome. Definitely will come back to Hotel Navona again. Alexander Lezhen. New York City Review #74:So... After a long plane ride, we arrived to find that they had given our room away to a German couple named Whithead, no joke... But Mike was quick to rememdy the situation and gave us one of their apartments close by. We later found out that it had been in his family since its construction some time in the 18th century. So rather than having a king room with a private bath for $120 a night, we had an apartment with a king bed, dining room, sitting room, kitchen and private bath. This was all at the same price as our room in Navona. In short, Mike made the best of a mix-up, as any conscientious business owner should do. Review #75:Had the good fortune to be back in Rome and naturally stayed at the Hotel Navona. Once again the experience was fantastic. What makes this hotel so great other than the perfect location? The staff, especially Mike! I will never stay at any other hotel in Rome! Review #76:This was my 9th trip to Rome and I could not have been at a better location, just steps from my favorite place, The Piazza Navona. The hotel has several floors and is a former 14th Century Palace. It has been converted and upgraded w/ AC and other accommodations. Although Wi Fi is advertised in the lobby area only, we stayed in suite # 5 and had great access. Our room even had 14th century paintings on the ceilings! Just lovely. The owner is friendly and accommodating as well as the staff and there is someone there 24/7 to assist you. I would Recommend this place to anyone looking for that European Flavor. Review #77:We initially booked for Hotel Navona and when i was confirming before our trip they said they had to put us in their sister hotel Residenzia Zanardarelli. It was only a block away but it was great! Even though there was a price difference they didn't charge us. The communication pre-visit was great with directions and clear pricing. Location of the hotel is perfect. i really really recommend it as its walking distance from so many sights and a short short bus ride to the Termini to catch the train to the airport. I would def stay there again. Lots of great restaurants nearby and the close vicinity to Vatican City allows you to get a head start on the queues there! A tour bus stop is right across the street from the hotel also. Lots to do in the city so you don't want to waste time with transportation. Enjoy Roma! Review #78:Our group of 9 couples stayed at the Hotel Navona for three days before boarding a ship for a cruise. We found the hotel to be extremely convenient. You could walk anywhere within a few minutes up to 15 minutes. The hotel was clean and quietly located. The only problem was that our van could not go down the small street to drop us off or pick us up but that was a minor inconvenience. If you want to spend your time seeing the historical attractions stay here. You won't waste time trying to catch buses or cabs. Every morning homemade hot rolls, pastries, coffee, tea, and juice was provided for breakfast. Review #79:We had a family group of 13 ranging in age between 9 and 87 and stayed six nights at the hotel. We had six rooms and we were put on the first floor down the hall from the front desk. The rooms were very clean and quite large for a European hotel. The one triple room we got was very large. The bathrooms were good size with good water pressure and good hairdryers. The rooms that fronted the hotel were quite noisy with street traffic, but we used earplugs and were fine; so you might want to ask for a back room. The staff was geat! The owner and Mike were very informative about Rome's history, restaurants and even set up transportation to and from the airport for our large group. The breakfast was coffee, teas, juice and rolls- enough to get you started. We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Navona! Review #80:I have been coming to Hotel Navona for almost two decades. The Hotel has always given me a warm welcome and they have become like family to me. I am quite surprised by the comments that some travellers have made of this family-run establishment. Being a family run business, complaints are taken personally, not as in a large hotel chain. I mention when things need to be fixed, exchanged or improved but in a polite manner. If you have an attitude that you are unhappy and everyone on either side of the reception desk should know it (we've all met travellors like that) then a small hotel (at a reasonable rate) in Italy (or most of Europe) is not for you. A traveller coming to Rome has to appreciate the high prices that hotels now command given that the Euro has more than doubled the cost of visiting the Eternal City. This sometimes makes it difficult to find a decent, well priced and safe place to stay, especially if you are a female travelling alone. Hotel Navona has provided me with this type of safe environment and this encouraged me to stay there alone or with my family. The rooms are clean, comfortable and the many renovations over the years now guarantee me windows with double-glazing that prevents the outside noise from coming in. The (very) light breakfast in the morning is welcoming but as some guests have written, if you want more than juice and a fresh bun, there are plenty of restaurants or bars within a few minutes walk that offer a greater variety. I've found this small hotel is always improving and always accommodating. If you are used to the large North American style hotels and amenities without the old world character, than this is not the place for you but of course you are going to have to pay a substantial premium to get that kind of service. Mirella- Toronto, CANADA - March 2007 Review #81:This hotel was suggested to us by someone who had recently been there. Having never been to Rome we were happy for a suggestion. The hotel is located 1 block from the Piazza Navona, the most beautiful Piazza in all of Rome. We were there for 4 days and walked everywhere including Vatican City from our hotel. The room we got was small but comfortable and service was great. The breakfast was so-so but was available. Our son went there on their honeymoon this past summer and were very pleased as well. I would go back there any time. Review #82:This being our first time to Rome, we were in the dark regarding where to stay and we were extremely fortunate to have found the Hotel Navona. It is within a block of Piazza Navona - THE place to be every evening after dark for couples, families, or just alone to soak it all in. In regards to location, there is no better place - it is so close to it all but still set back enough to be extremely quiet. We walked everywhere with our 5-year old from the hotel to include the coliseum, Pantheon, multiple churches (there are many in Rome! ), the Vatican - although a bit far, Spanish Steps, all from the hotel. The room was sufficient for our needs and they even placed a small bed in the room for our daughter and she appreciated the attention. If you plan to see Rome and not hang out in your hotel room then this is a perfect hotel. If you are looking for amenities and luxury and to be catered to then perhaps you should keep looking. Clean and quiet and simple. Great for sightseeing in this great city. Included breakfast is merely sustenance but coffee was good. Air conditioning worked fine. Plenty of hot water and water pressure. Review #83:Four of us made our bi annual trip to Rome for the rugby international between Italy and England on February 10th. Italy were very unlucky not to win the encounter for the first time, so it was a real bonus to be staying in the Hotel Navona, to discuss where England nearly came undone! The staff and especially the owner Corry and his interesting family, were great. The rooms were clean and spotless, with new beds installed for our arrival, plus the hospitality in showing us around this unique hotel was second to none. In terms of value for money, can't fault the Navona and will be going back for our next trip in 2010, if not before! Review #84:I've stayed in this hotel twice and have found it to be clean. The staff arent going to love you to death and the owner is a little too pleased with himself - but thats ok - because I didnt come to Rome to spend the day shooting the breeze with them. The breakfast, breakfast room and staff serving it, leave much to be desired and you wont be missing out if you dont have it ,and thats what I recommend you do, as there are plenty of nice places you can go to near the hotel for fresh coffee and bread. The hotel is in a great location and for \u20ac140 a night you are not going to get much better, so would all those who are looking for 5 star quality (based on the other reviews here) do everyone else a favour, unlock their wallets and pay $500 a night for a hotel where they'll get what they want. You wont get much in New York for $140 so why expect it elsewhere. I cant believe some of the negative reviews here. One even complains about audible noise when in the room during the day. What were they doing there during the day??? Another complains about insufficient room in the bathroom for two people - please!!!!!!! This is one of the great cities of the world - the hotel is in the centre of it - quit complaining, get out and see it. If you walk the legs off yourself during the day, like you should - you'll be too tired in the evening to care about the five star niceties that are missing in Hotel Navona. Review #85:I stayed in the annexe at this hotel recently and was most impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the family who own it. The rooms were clean, well priced and in a fantastic location right by the Piazza Navona. It was an excellent base and I would not hesitate to recommend it Review #86:The position can't be faulted. My room was so small I couldn't swing a flea let alone a cat but the positives - it was clean and close to everything. My negative was the awful bed and pillow. After walking until I couldn't walk another step I wanted a bed in which I would be comfortable to sleep but my bed resembled a block of concrete and the pillow was no softer and so thin as to be useless. The breakfast was filling if nothing and I loved the orange juice served in a plastic cup. Would I stay there again - yes but I would ask for a different room that was a bit larger and take my own pillow. Review #87:Not to be confused with any other \"Hotel Navona\" as this place is the real deal. There is only one Hotel Navona in Rome, Italy and we loved staying there. WIth wonderful, hospitable staff and really nice rooms especially for a family of four. The hotel was handy to the centre of Rome...walk to everything. Review #88:This is the third time we have stayed at either this hotel or the Residenza Zanardelli which is on the other side of the piazza and owned by the same people. The location is near our favorite and best piazza in Rome and most of the popular sites are within walking distance. The staff is always helpful and the rooms are comfortable and clean. Review #89:Great Value, Great Service. Clean Rooms, Terrific Area, Cold A/C, Hot Water. Close to all tourist attractions,We walked everywhere. Located steps from the Piazza. Hotel Staff was helpful. We felt very safe in our rooms. Breakfast was typical Italian. Pastries etc. So we ended up eating out. There is no elevator, the stairs aren't that bad, might be difficult if your older. Staff supplied us with computer when we asked. They called cabs, gave directions, suggested places to eat. Rooms where clean, sheets where crisp. We had a tv in our room, there is no phone within the room itself. The hotel does sell phone cards, which is a benefit. Review #90:This is a great find in Rome. Perfect location, clean, quiet room, good AC. The staff is very nice. For example, they called a restaurant for us to obtain a reservation and had good recommendations. I would highly recommend this hotel for someone who wants a simple, clean place to stay while you explore Rome. Review #91:Although the hotel is well positioned, the rooms are nothing like the pictures shown on the website. Our standard room did not have air conditioning as stated in the web site and the room was small to the extent of being claustophobic The attitude of the owner left much to be desired, as when challenged the rooms did not match the picture on the website, we were told \" You are paying for the location not the room. The exterior of the courtyard was dilapadated and uncared for. Breakfast while included was very sparse \" a roll and cup of coffe and fruit juice out of plastic cups\" An experience to avoid Review #92:This hotel is located within steps of all the major sights. It is literally one block from the Piazza Navona. Overall the rooms were small, some smaller(tiny) than others, we've experienced both. The beds aren't comfy, but who cares if your out all day. This is definitely a no frills hotel; its main advantage is the LOCATION. Mike, the receptionist, was very accomodating and spoke english. Review #93:Absolutely the worst bed i've ever slept in. Taking a shower was a real chore. the ceiling in the shower was less than six feet high. The water temperature was ice cold three out of four days. The server at breakfast was rude at best. Packaged Croissants for breakfast and weak coffee. The other guests in my group thought the front desk help was rude and un-helpful, however; i found her sexy charning and most inviting. Do not take a shower after 7:30 am. or the water will be less than room temperature. make sure to have an appointment with your chiropractor after leaving this dump. Review #94:In May, we emailed Hotel Navona for a room for 5 nights iearly October and got back an immediate response that the hotel was full but that they could provide a small apartment near the hotel for $175 E per night. We telephoned to make sure we understood the arrangement and booked the stay. When we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that we would be staying in \"the family palace\" and had no idea what we had let ourselves in for, The owner drove us to the \"palace\" and explained that it had been owned by the family since the 17th century and that they had only recently converted a few rooms to small apartments. We were very pleasantly surprised to find ourselves in a delightfully charming apartment on Corso Vittorio Emanuele with a large bedroom, a sitting room, a kitchen, and a small bathroom. We were on the fourth floor but had a lift and Navona staff brought our luggage in and put it in a taxi for us when we left. There were double windows that blocked out noise from the street but allowed a great view--down Corso on one side and into a central courtyard on the other. We were about 3 blocks from Piazza Navona and less than 2 from Campo di Fiori, right on major bus lines, next door to an excellent coffee/cafe shop that opened at 6:00 and had great, inexpensive coffee and breads and pastries in the morning and soups and sandwiches at lunch. The family that owns Hotel Navona could not have been more pleasant and accommodating, as was the staff. I would definitely plan to stay here again. Review #95:My husband and two 11 year old daughters stayed at this property in Rome. It's about a 60 euro trip from the airport (FCO), along the way you see a lot of Roma. The location is great, walking distance from anything you'd like to see. Everything! A stair climb is required. They had our room ready, it was clean...and of course very old. Not posh. No frills. Pretty simple. The woman at the desk is very busy, speaks English. Wi-fi only works from the lobby, probably because of the very ancient thick walls. A simple breakfast off coffee and pastries. They were all very nice to us. We would stay there again. Review #96:This hotel was great value for money - even though our room did not have any of the features advertised - no view, no frescos, nothing ancient about it - a tiny room stuck in the corner of a hallway. But the bed was the most comfortable of the four hotels we stayed at in Italy, the bath room was super modern - the whole thing was very clean - there was a small safe in a cupboard for valuables. There was a clothesline just outside a door (that opened onto a central courtyard) that we used to dry socks and undies. The lady at the desk was very helpful arranging tickets. the AC was controlled by a remote, and although they turned it off everyday when cleaning the room, it did not take long for the room to be cool enough and actually cold during the night. This will be \"our hotel\" in Rome. Review #97:We were only at this hotel for a few days en-route to a cruise and really wished we could have stayed longer. Rooms were lovely, it was perfectly situated and you really knew you were in Rome, unlike some of the other hotels where you could be anywhere! The staff were wonderful and the owner totally made our trip to Rome, by telling us some great places to go and even taking us for a coffee in Rome's best coffee house. When I go back to Rome, I wouldn't stay anywhere else!! ! Review #98:We just returned from our stay at the Hotel Navona in Rome. We had visited Rome twice before and are well aware that most of the rooms and bathrooms are small by American standards. Our room was small, which was fine. The room was clean and very basic - no complaints with that. Our room was on the top floor and the man that showed us up referred to it as an apartment - don't know why. Now the bad part. The walls were paper thin and we could actually see light from the room next to us from a space where the wall did not meet the ceiling. We were able to hear the neighbor on one side of us every time she coughed and that was the side that had our bathroom separating the rooms. The room on the other side was more of a problem. Although in any other hotel it probably would not have been an issue, at the Navona the walls were so thin we were able to hear EVERY word of their conversations, EVERY time they used the bathroom as well as their nightly romantic adventures. Although their bathroom separated their room from ours, it was as though they were IN OUR room. I will say the location is great - close to many of the sites as well as great restraunts and right around the corner from a good coffee shop. The breakfast was ok - coffee, OJ, a large french roll and several types of cellophane wrapped cakey things that i would recommend avoiding. The prices in Rome are very high by US standards. we paid 145 euro per night here which was much less than most of the other places i saw online or in guidebooks that did not have as good of a location. One other thing worth mentioning for those who travel with lots of luggage - there is no lift/elevator. Review #99:My teenage son and I were very pleased with the comfort of our room (and easy access to WiFi), but mostly we were impressed with the kindness, courtesy and efficiency of the hotel staff who assisted in many details and small matters that made our 7-day stay very positive. The rooms are secure and well maintained, the furnishings comfortable, the air conditioning welcome, and the location is centrally located to major attractions. I would recommend highly and will gladly book a visit again.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Overall a very nice hotel in an upscale location. It's located at the top of via veneto which is lined with upscale restaurants and hotels. Easy walk to Berbirini metro stop and across the street from a bus stop. Double room was spacious and clean. Bathrooms were marble and clean. Breakfast had a very good variety of food. Staff were helpful. Didn't have a chance to check out the fitness facility. Only a couple negatives...desk chair was wobbly and nearly broken. Internet didn't work in my original room. Review #1:After having stayed at a sub-par hotel for 5 days (hotel delle nazione) we were ready for a nice hotel and the Marriott did not disappoint. They were wonderful and gave us a very nice upgrade overlooking the gardens. Because they are an international chain - the rooms are nice-sized (much bigger than the European standard) They really get it when it comes to customer service - we had an enjoyable stay. Review #2:We found the Rome Marriott Grand Hotel Flora to be nearly perfect for us. We spent our first night and our last five nights in Italy there. The lobby is spacious, bright and comfortable. The rooms are large by European standards and well maintained. The bathroom we had for the last five nights had both a shower and a bathtub. There is free internet in the room. On the first floor there are two computers available for 30 minutes at a time for free, together with a free printer. The first room we stayed in had a view of the Via Veneto. The second room had a view of the walls by Borghese Park. We found the staff to be first rate and very friendly. The concierges were very helpful. They made good suggestions about restaurants and places to visit. For example, the concierge told us about a concert featuring operatic arias that we were very pleased to have attended. Before we checked out, the bellhops were able to weigh our luggage, so that we can avoid problems at the airport. We ate breakfast once at the Marriott. Breakfast is served on the roof on the seventh floor. You have good views of the Vatican and large parts of Rome from the roof. The location is great. The hotel is next to the southern entrance to the Villa Borghese Park, which is a very nice place to walk, bike ride and just relax on a bench. It is also the home of Villa Borghese Gardens. The hotel is not a difficult walk to the central part of Rome. The bus lines are convenient and there is a cabstand right around the corner. There are several very good restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel. We were very pleased to have stayed at this hotel. Review #3:Although this hotel is bit pricier than others, it's truly an excellent choice if you are traveling with your kids. We recently traveled with our 15 & 11 yr. old kids. They were happy to get an \"american\" size room with a huge sitting area (presidential suite). The staff was incredibly helpful and professional. The location was ideal. We were close to the park and a beautiful part of Rome that was just a bit away from all the crazy traffic and all the overwhelming tour groups. I would certainly stay here again! ! Review #4:For starters, I was traveling for business but got a great rate of 269 Euros, breakfast not included. Positives: The staff is fantastic, very good customer service. Very friendly and five star quality. Location is very good...but not spectacular as everyone described. I think I would have preferred to be closer to the Trevi Fountain or The Spanish Steps. Negatives: I arrived late after traveling and ordered room service. 35 Euros (about $50 USD) for the smallest pizza, bottle of water and glass of red wine. Tiny. And not very good. Also, my room was TINY. My suitcase wouldn't even fit between the bed and the TV, I had to lift it over. Finally, the bedding and the shower are in serious need of an update. I can't believe they would have such outdated ammenities in a five star hotel. Luckily, I didn't really pay five star price...because it wouldn't have been worth it. However, for what I paid it was very comfortable and clean, in a fine location and the staff was extremely friendly. If you have a choice, The Westin is right up the street and looks better. Review #5:Stayed here for 3 days in August. Very nice hotel with all the conveniences of American hotels. The room was a bit on the small side but very nice. Short walk to the Spanish steps and lot's of good restraunt choices near by. Would definitely saty here again. Review #6:It's what you should expect in Rome...expensive hotels...small rooms. But it was clean, quiet (asked for an interior room away from the street), and comfortable. Front desk staff was helpful and accommodating. Free internet was nice. Nice location - across from restaurants, shopping, metro station; pleasant walk to Spanish Steps - 10 mins or so Would go back. Review #7:Good location - steps away from Villa Borghese, major Piazzas, walking distance to Spanish Steps, Harry's Bar, and Trevi Fountain. The room and the bathroom were tiny in comparson to the other hotels. A bonus is that they give you free internet access - that's unheard of at most hotels in Europe. This hotel is on Via Venetto which is home to most of the 5 star hotels in Rome. I would stay here again. Review #8:I enjoyed our stay, as we stayed three nights in two rooms. (Kids in one, adults in others). The rooms are small by American standards, so there is no way to put four in a room. You'll need to splurge a bit or use points. I enjoyed the hotel, but I think the Via Veneto is past its heyday. As we strolled through Rome, I was wishing we would have stayed a in a little more \"authentic\" neighborhood, and the Via Veneto is crammed with hotel names you can see anywhere. We walked to the Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain without issue, but only took the subway to the Coliseum. We had a taxi to the Vatican. The breakfast on the rooftop is a bit oversold. We did it one morning, and found the views to be great, but the food was about what you would find in the average US concierge floor, and the prices were pretty steep. Better values can be had all over Rome, and we found them close to the hotel with better food. Service was up to Marriott standards, as was the housekeeping. I know there are those to list how to \"walk\" from teh train station, but don't consider it if you are traveling with kids or carrying luggage....it is a haul. I think 10 Euros got four of us to the hotel in 6-7 minutes, and it was money well spent! Not a bad hotel at all, and would go back if I were staying with points! Review #9:Perfect location for our business travel group. Marriott Grand Flora met our expectations in all categories: Close proximity to the airport (40 Euro or less by Taxi), easy walking distance to the center of Rome via Metro tunnel (across the street), comfortable rooms, large bed, stylish rooms with good working area. Breakfast buffet included and a reasonable internet fee (9 Euro for 7 days). Professional staff and helpful Concierge. Rates are competitive and Marriott has the edge with this hotel. Our next hotel reservation will be at the Grand Flora on our return trip. Review #10:This hotel's location is excellent for walking to most of the sites in town. Those that are not in walking distance can be reached by the subway, which can be accessed across the street. (The entrance tunnel to the subway is very long, maybe a block!) For Americans, keep in mind that this hotel is much more European than many Marriotts, especially when it comes to breakfast. Everything about my stay perfect. Review #11:We stayed at the Grand Flora in June 2007, using a Marriott European sampler. Hard to get nights at this property for points, so we lucked out (I am platinum, not sure if that helps). Staff was very friendly and helpful, and while (as other have said) the breakfast was not anything to write home about, it was free and afforded spectacular views of the city - a wonderful way to start your day in Rome. The location was great, as Rome is a very \"walk-able\" city. The rooms are a bit tired and warn and the beds are hard, but the bath was lovely, and the view of the Villa Borghese (park) from the window alcove was stunning. Loved the huge windows and the fact that you could throw them open and sit on the wide stone edging outside of the window. We were on the second floor and did not hear any street noise when the windows were closed. Note: part of the Via Venetto was closed during our first 2 days due to Bush's state visit, so it was even quite when the windows were open! Not sure if I would pay $500 a night, but I certainly feel I made good use of my Marriott points! Review #12:The Marriott Gran Flora is a wonderful hotel. The rooms, staff and food are excellent. Breakfast is served on the top floor of the hotel. You may eat outside with outstanding views of the city or inside. The breakfast is the most generous in regard to selection and fine quality. Each day for no charge you may have a picnic lunch to take if you wish. The Gran Flora located on Via Venuto is surrounded by excellent restaurants-Harry' Bar and Grille and many others. You can easily walk to the Spanish Steps and if you are in good shape Trevi Fountain. Other sites are a short taxi ride away. Review #13:We had not planned to go to this hotel so we did not have any expectations. All in all it was a very nice and pleasant experience. Rumors about arrogant Romans offering poor service do not emerge from this hotel. The staff is very professional, smiling and always helpful. We had just spent a terrible night at a dreadful hotel in Fiuggi south west of Rome, and coming to the Marriott Grand Flora was such a relief. Itl was the exact opposite of the other hotel in Fuiggi (Hotel Sliva Splendid). Maybe we were easy to please, but we really enjoyed everything about this hotel (did miss free internet access in the room though). The loacation is great \u2013 on Via Veneto, close to the Villa Borghese garden and the Spanish Steps. A nice quiet corner compared to the crowded streets close to the Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Termini etc. Conclusion: Highly reccommend. Review #14:Stayed here two nights at a rate of about 350 EU a night in July. While we had stayed at cheaper properties around rome (120-150 EU nights) I am pretty loyal to Marriott and decided to check this one out. Unlike the last review, I found the staff to be pretty nice and very friendly. I'm only in my 20's and don't dress like the typical high class person if you will (shorts and sandals for me all day) yet they were very friendly and outgoing. First night the room service brought a free bottle of wine for us (nice little touch), Unlimited internet and breakfast on the roof-top were also included (i'm not sure if this was all because I'm a 'gold' member with them or not). Would I stay here again, probably not for the price. Was just as happy if not happier with a couple of hotels in rome we stayed at that were 120-150 EU a night. But the flora was nice I'll give it that, but not any nicer than the average Marriott property in the states i thought Review #15:My husband and I spent a month traveling around Italy for our honeymoon and stayed in Rome for one week at the end of the trip. Rome was our last stop and we were more than pleased with the Grand Flora. It is located on a very prestigious street with many other 5-star hotels. We thought the Grand Flora was located in a perfect spot just across from the Borghese Park and within walking distance to most everything. It is a cab ride to the Ancient City and Vatican but neither were very pricey (less than 10 euros). We were upgraded to a VERY large room (the size of some peoples homes) with a beautiful view of the Borghese Park and St. Peter's Dome. They serve breakfast every morning on their rooftop with sweeping views of Rome. The breakfast was amazing, they had the largest spread of any hotel we stayed at while on the trip. It was delicious with spectacular views. We had turndown service every night with some great chocolates as well. They do offer free internet which was nice so we could catch up on the news and stay in touch with family. The staff was very helpful (espcially the bell men). Review #16:I stayed at the Marriott Grand Hotel Flora for a company business meeting. We were a group of 12 people and we also used the hotels meeting facilities. The room was well equipped and comfortable, including free internet, which was very important to me. The meeting room was well prepared including the proper seating arrangement, and the relevant audio visual equipment. Besides the business activities, the hotel is very well located at the top of Via Veneto, and has a rooftop terrance on the seventh floor with an amazing view of the entire city. Review #17:This hotel is located on Via Veneto in a very upscale neighborhood. It took about 20-25 minutes to walk to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and Pantheon area. The cab ride to Colosseum was 5 euro. We took the Metro to the Vatican area and the ride costs 1 euro, or you can buy a one-day pass for 4 euro good for subway as well as buses. Front reception is professional and friendly. Our request for early check-in was accommodated. FREE INTERNET FOR 7 DAYS! (we did not get free Internet anywhere else on this trip to Italy). Room is lovely and quiet. The shower does not flood the bathroom, which is rare in Italian hotels. Lovely hotel. I would definitely stay there again. Review #18:If you want true 5 star service and standards you are used to in Asia.....don't go to Rome. This hotel is simply the best quality and overall value for Rome. I have stayed all over the Via Vittorio Veneto (think the set of La Dolce Vita) and the Marriott wins everytime. First, realize that all of the top Italian hotels put all their money into the lobby...they all look great from the outside. The rooms are often a much different story. Second...the is the Manhattan of Rome...so unless you are willing to spend $3000 a night for a room, you will get a 4 and even a 3 star experience in most of these tired old properties even when you spend $400+ a night. But remember...it is Roma!! Dont spend time in your room!!! Explore and eat and stay out late. Here is one downside of this (and most high end) Marriotts....at peak season they are full of loud, obnoxious, large American housewives with 2+ iPhone disinterested teenagers in tow and a beaten down corporate exec husband who paid for the entire trip with frequent flyer miles and then Marriott miles. They moan and groan and complain about EVERYTHING and this is their \"payback\" for a year of being abandoned by their world trotting hard working husbands -- who are all platinum elite status. They want everything free and they are highly resentful that their spouse gets to escape from the soccer mom life all year for places like Rome, Bangkok, Sydney, etc...surrounded by fun, young, hot women. So....leave your fat wife at home....bring a smile, shoulder shrug and love of all things Italian and Rome and this Marriott will be the BEST decision you could make. Old but spotless clean with VERY good staff who are exceptionally helpful....even to loud complaining spouses. Review #19:My wife and I stayed the Marriott Grand Flora for our Honeymoon. The service was fantastic and everyone spoke English which was a huge help for us. We told the front desk that it was our honeymoon and they upgraded us to a Jr. suite and then sent a bottle of Champaign to our room. Alitalia lost our luggage and the concierge did a great job talking to the airline to help us get out luggage back. The room was a good size with a comfortable bed, and all the amenities you would expect form a Marriott. Overall we were very pleased with our stay. Review #20:We are just concluding a week in Rome with our 2 adult daughters. Each morning we would meet for a fantastic buffet breakfast on the 7th floor. The hotel is at the top of Via Vittorio Veneto - just below Borhgese Gardens so you take in a perfect view of Rome from the huge expanse of windows while dining. The staff is warm and very helpful but other than suggestions for dining, your access to Rome needs no assist! The taxi stand is a couple of blocks down the hill, and the A Metro Barbarini stop a couple of blocks further. We walked or rode all over Rome and we always came home to a beautiful and tranquil room overlooking Via Veneto. For those who are light sleepers, we live suburban quiet lives and noise was never an issue - just Roman background music. The restaurant, The Cabiria,and the bar are also of excellent quality and service. Review #21:Me and my husband stayed at the hotel for 4 nights abd 5 days! we absolutely loved our warm stay. The staff was kind, warm and hospitable. We loved the rooms! they were typical english rooms. It was our honeymoon so, we loved the cosy feel of the place. We had a great time. The complimentary breakfast was also well arranged and delicious. Review #22:This is a fairly expensive hotel in the heart of Rome and has everything you would expect from a luxury hotel. The staff are great, the decor is really nice and looks clean and new. The location is perfect, with lots of shops and restaurants nearby, within walking distance of all the major sights and right next to a large park. My king size room was a good size. Some colleagues mentioned that their single rooms seemed a bit small but they admitted that they were very comfortable. Breakfast is a highlight with a fantastic view of the city from the 7th floor terrace. At \u20ac30 breakfast is a bit pricey. Book direct with the hotel and try to negotiate a price that includes breakfast then you won't have to worry about it. Review #23:This Marriott was wonderful. Everything from the location, the hotel staff, the free internet, the cleanliness, and the roof top breakfest. The hotel is within walking distance for everything especially the spanish step and the trevi fountain. As a Gold member I would recommend this hotel. The only recomendation would be to upgrade the TV's and add CNN as one of their channel selections. Review #24:Our stay was one night on September 27 and three nights Oct 2-4 using Marriott points. We have no complaints although we probably would not have paid the going rate if we did not have points. Our one night only stay was in a slightly better room with a very comfortable bed and luxury linens. The three night stay at the end of our trip to Italy, had a harder bed and standard hotel bedding, so I think there are difference in the rooms withinin the same category. The breakfast on the terrace every day was great - eveything you could want - and the view was beautiful! The front desk staff was helpful. They were very professional if not overly friendly. The hotel is very near the Borghese gardens which we visited twice. We walked to the Trevi fountain every day while at the hotel and to the Spanish steps. We also walked from the Pantheon, the Vatican and the Forum - although those walks were longer than many would consider walking distance. Review #25:We stayed here using Marriott points for our last night in Rome. We found the location to be very convenient. The room was spacious, clean and had that old world charm. The breakfast buffet was fabulous. The dining room is on the top floor overlooking all of Rome. It was absolutely beautiful. And the food was great too :) We would stay here again if we get the chance! Review #26:went to rome with my husband for 5 nights. the hotel was lovely even though it was expensive. there wasnt any tea and coffee making facilities which i found unusual. the girl at reception was very helpful and gave us a map and circled the best shopping area lol. would definately go back. Review #27:I found this hotel on trip advisor. I was originally scheduled to stay at another well know hotel that the reviews were not so good so I changed to this property. I loved my room. Reception and check in were excellent. In room dinning and the Cabiria Restaurant had great food and service. All good! Review #28:We spent three great nights at the Grand Flora. To start with, the location was superb. We saw every typical tourist sight there is, and never took a cab. With that said, the hotel is not in too busy an area. The rooms are spacious by European standards, kept very clean and are maintained well. The staff was professional and helpful. The management of this hotel is firt class. Bottom line - stay here. Review #29:The Marriott Grand Flora in Rome is a beautiful hotel in a great location in Rome. The hotel staff was great! Hotel restaurant was very nice, but so many other fantastic restaurants in the area. I highly recommend this property if you're staying in Rome. Review #30:The hotel is attractive and conveniently located, but nearby restaurants are pricey. We were fortunate to stay for free using Marriott points. Perhaps that is why they gave us a very small room. The bathroom was small too. Linens were not luxurious. They do not have king size beds and the 2 beds kept sliding apart. They did let us check email free on their computers. The doormen and the concierge were barely helpful. Disappointing service. If we had to pay, we'd check out the Westin. Review #31:We used points for 2 rooms at the Marriott Grand Flora for 4 nights in June. Check-in was easy and our rooms were very clean and comfortable with all marble bathrooms. Breakfast on the roof terrace overlooking the city was exceptionally beautiful, although upon arriving each morning it was difficult to find a clean table to sit down to. We found the location to be very good as we walked to sites with the exception of the Vatican which was a 10 euro cab ride. We should have allowed more time in Rome, although no matter how long of a stay there would still be more to see. Review #32:My wife and I spent 3 night at Grand Flora at the head of Via Veneto and thoroughly enjoyed it. The location was in an exciting part of town with many shops, restaurants and points of interest within walking distance. The hotel was very nicely appointed and was very clean throughout. Our room was a little dated but nice sized, clean, comfortable and most importantly, quiet. Among the many things we liked, the two that stood out were the staff and the rooftop restaurant. The staff couldn't do enough for us. Every member (and there were MANY) seemed to have been selected for personality and poise. If the young lady who spent 20 minutes helping me get my cell phone going is reading, again I say gracie mille! Along the same lines, a wonderful complimentary breakfast was served in a rooftop restaurant that was bright, well appointed and had the most sumtuous assortments of foods one could imagine. It also has an outdoor patio that looks West and North with views of the city, the beautiful Borgese gardens and park. Again, the entire staff in the restaurant was very anxious to help in any way that they could. While there are less expensive addresses and hotels in which to stay in Rome, I would definetly recommend the Grand Flora for a full, enriching experience. Review #33:This wasn't the nicest Marriot I've ever stayed in, but it definitely was a nice hotel. The room was a bit small, but I suppose that is Europe. The one big complaint I had about the room was that the two double beds we had were pushed together (which is common in Europe). I wouldn't mind in a three star hotel, but in a four or five star hotel, I expect enough space in the room to have the bed's spaced apart. The bathroom was very nice and was tastefully done. One huge thing that I like a lot was free high-speed internet. Europe, as a whole, just does not offer free internet in most hotels, regardless of class. That is why I was pleasantly surprised to have free internet access in the room. Did not eat in the hotel at all. When I am sight-seeing or seeing a new city for pleasure, I think the worst possible thing to do is eat in the hotel unless the dining experience at a hotel warrants a visit in itself. Overall, I liked the hotel. Very nice, elegant neighborhood and the hotel staff was very friendly. Review #34:From the moment you arrive at the Grand Flora Hotel on Via Veneto, you know that you are at one of Marriott's premier hotels. The doormen are so polite and accommodating. You enter an elegant hotel, beautifully decorated with a lovely marble staircase. We traveled with our two teenage sons, and we had two Superior rooms on the second floor. We only used the stairs which were so convenient. The rooms were of a nice size, the beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms, while not very large, were of beautiful marble and were very clean. The breakfast buffet and the view from the rooftop was incredible! We were spoiled by the wonderful selection of eggs, meats, cheeses, pastries and more. You can walk to the Spanish Steps. I did walk to Piazza Navona, but it was a very long walk. To get to the Vatican, take a cab or walk down Via Veneto to the Barberini Station to take the train to the Vatican/St. Peter's Square. Via Veneto remains a beautiful avenue to stay on, and should we return to Rome, we would return to the Grand Flora Hotel. Review #35:Just amazing....top to bottom, gorgeous hotel, security at night. Delicious breakfast on the roof in the AM. Its Europe, so the rooms are small. Dont expect to stay in a large suite it may be a Marriot, but its still in Rome. Small Rooms VERY clean though. Gorgeous bathrooms. Located on Via Venetto which is very popular with the nicer hotels and restaurants. Although not my favorite restaurants on the strip. Very commercial. Another great thing about this Hotel is it is located across from Villa Borghese which I a beautiful Park, if you get a decent room, you may have an amazing view. Review #36:We stayed two nights. The hotel is a beautiful old hotel. Similar to those in San Francisco or Washington DC. Beautifully appointed, clean and with a great view of the area. The elevator is very small. The staff were most accommodating and checked us in early and promptly. The internet and Wifi service was great. Breakfast was included, but the American version is not good. Eggs were runny and most of the food was cold. The European breakfast was very good. The dinning terrace was closed when we were there. Review #37:We stayed there on the last leg of our 18 day vacations through italy. The hotel was nice, the breakfast was excellent, the service was good. We feel the it was over priced for what we got compared to other places. I would stay again if the price was right we paid a 5 star price and got a 3 1/2 star experience. Review #38:This was our first trip to Rome and we wanted to stay someplace nice. Marriott Grand Flora is very nice. We stayed using points and were upgraded to a Jr. Suite - very, very nice. Hotel is in great upscale location. Plenty to do within walking distance. Good selection of restaurants in area. Metro station not too far. The Jr. Suite was a good size bedroom and comfortable living/sitting room. Roof restaurant for breakfast was closed, but looked like a great place to start the day. You can see the Vatican from the roof. Doorman was very helpful with directions, taxis, etc. Internet service provided free. Review #39:We stayed at the Marriott Flora for 4 days at the beginning of our trip to Italy and 2 days at the end of our 3 week vacation. The hotel is perfectly located on the beautiful Via Venetto street where you can eat, shop and or just take a nice walk. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Spanish Steps, and from there a few minutes more walk to the shopping street of Via Del Corso and sites to see such as the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and other spectacular churches. Its also at the entrance of the a park called Villa Borghese. We rented bikes for a couple of Euros and had a great morning ride with my wife and 12yr daughter. Service was 5*... the hotel took great care of to ensure we has a great stay, from the check-in staff to the restaurant staff (we had breakfast included). We needed a roll-in bed for my daugther which i forgot to mention on the reservation and they set it up within minutes of check-in apologizing to me - for my mistake! The roof-top restaurant is spectacular for breakfast. Great views of the Vatican and the park. Would definitely stay here again. Review #40:Very nice location; the Via Veneto is the Roman equivalent of Rodeo Drive in Hollywood, or the Champs Elysee in Paris. Very expensive shops in the area. It's not in the center of all the touristic sites, but not too dreadfully far from a metro station either through which you can access the rest of Rome. The rooms are rather small, but nicely decorated. The bed was fairly comfortable. The staff was very friendly and attentive to requests. The music in the bar was rather loud, which made conversation somewhat difficult. Review #41:We stayed for a long weekend here whilest my wife was in Italy for business outside the city. The reception was great we felt relly welcome. Staff very helpfull and friendly. The room was nice, overlooking the via vento and not noisy. The bathroom was very nice. room was not big but very comfortable. Breakfast was great, good food while overlooking the city from the roofterras. good capucinos. Bar was very welcoming with good service also while sitting outside late in the evening. No complains here! Wwe while return for sure when my wife has to to be in Italy again for work. Review #42:My wife and I stayed here using points for 5 nights and it was a great experience. Unlike other hotels when you stay with points, the staff was very friendly and even gave us a room upgrade. The room was clean and quiet. The breakfast was very good each morning with a great view from the roof. The location is great as it is fairly close to the Spanish Steps metro stop and there a number of bus stops just outside the hotel that can get you pretty much anywhere. Review #43:Stayed here in Feb. 2008. The rooms are not a typical Marriott room. They are worn but still nice. The staff was helpful. Great location. It was in walking distance of all of the main sites. Lobby was nice. Hotel bar was great and the bartender was fantastic. We had the free breakfast buffet. I would not pay for it but since it was free we ate at it a couple times during our stay. Review #44:Earlier this month, my husband and I were fortunate enough to stay at this lovely hotel for 5 nights. We were thrilled with its location, right on the Via Veneto, inside the old wall, with many dining options in the evenings. We had a fantastic suite, with a balcony overlooking the city and the Via Veneto. This is an old hotel, that is in perfect condition. Rooms and public areas are immaculate. The staff is very helpful and professional. We really enjoyed the excellent breakfast every morning, that was made especially nice, by being able to eat outside, and enjoy the views. The breakfast staff was particularly good. This is a great hotel, in a wonderful location. Review #45:We stayed for a week at the Flora. The location is terrific. You can walk to a lot of the attractions. (albeit a long walk). Right outside the hotel is a portal for the 1800 year old Aurelian Wall. Across the street is the Villa Borghese. The staff throught the hotel provided excellent and friendly service. There are tons of sidewalk restaurants in the area. One tip - Across the street you will find an escalator down to an underground level. Actually, it is two escalators. If you take that and walk a couple of hundred yards, you will find a complete supermarket underground. This is a great place to get some snacks , water and even a bottle of vino for your room. We found the rooms to be decent. The bathroom was a bit small in our first room but part of that is due to the bidet. Breakfast on the rooftop is a great experience. You can see the vatican and other landmarks (bring binoculars if you can) When we were leaving, our flight had to return for an emergency landing due to a cracked windshield. The airline tried to put us up in what they claimed was a four star hotel in Ostia. that place was a dump. We called the Flora and they confirmed they had a room available. Unfortunately, the limo service they use didn't have any available cars but we were able to find a limo on our own. Summary. If we go back to Rome, we will most likely make the Flora our first choice. Review #46:Even by European standards this hotel is not a 5 star. Yes, if you want a big room on the most expensive street in Rome, then book here. The rooms and bedding are outdated and old. The beds were uncomfortable, no covers, and the bathroom was small (not unexpected in EU). If you want location and \"comfort\", then go to the InterContinetal at the top of the Spanish Steps. The rooms are smaller, but the bedding is cozy comfort and the bathrooms are much bigger (Rm 123 is great! ), or ask for a room with a view of the inner courtyard. The only saving grace at the Marriott is the breakfast buffet, that was included because of my status. And Sonya the front desk lady that works the evening shift. Review #47:Our second stay at the Marriott Flora as we loved our previous visit so much. This time we were allocated a tiny room - albeit well decorated - with a view of a brick wall. Staff were rude, unsmiling and clearly would rather being doing other things than assisting guests. We had a private dinner on the roof terrace which offers stunning views over the city (breakfast is also served there) but the food was terrible. We ate in a local restaurant the following night for the same price and the entire experience was oustanding. Breakfast is good but again they are bad with even the most basic tasks (clearing tables, bringing coffee etc). The hotel is in a great location which is its main selling point. I am sure your (large amount of) money would be better spent elsewhere and I have to say that mine will be on my next visit to Rome. Review #48:This was our first stay in Rome. The Grand Flora is a majestic hotel, well maintained, but not overwhelming in size. Our room, 201, was at the back corner of the hotel looking out on the walls surrounding Villa Borghese. Our room was very spacious, which we valued during our 6 day - 5 night stay. Street noise is there (e.g., trash pickup early each morning), but nothing like Manhattan or downtown Boston! Its location at the top of Via Veneto is very close to anything you want to see in Rome. Lots of good, and reasonably priced, restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Coffee is available early each morning in the lobby. And, we had \"breakfast\" most mornings at the Pasticceria around the corner from the hotel. It has more Italian pastries than you can imagine. The front desk staff was always helpful and the concierge (especially Marco) was resourceful and responsive to our questions. Courtesy Internet service each day was a nice touch too. Review #49:We totally enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The service was second to none! We felt pampered. Ice was delivered to our room in a silver ice bucket! Ice! real ICE! You don't get that everywhere in eroupe. Breakfast was great. The top floor resturant has a great view of the city. The room and bathrom were constantly cleaned and refreshed. Turn down service, robes and candy were there everynight. This hotel is close enough to tour bus pickup sites that it was like having your own transportation. Nice Clean and quite area of the city. Local resturants abound! Try the El pompadoro. We were not in the heart of the city, but the next best thing. We were near the Villa Borghese, nice to see and the park was great. We had a room in the front, and it was very quite. I will stay here everytime i go to Rome. This was by far the best part (Hotel Wise) of our three week trip throught France and Italy. Try it, your love! Review #50:We stayed 4 nights in November. This is just an average hotel in my opinion - not great and not terrible. I am a conference planner, so I stay in a lot of hotels. This one did not seem up to Marriott standards, nor worthy of the hefty price tag, in my opinion. The rooms were a bit tired and could use a refresher. The carpet was really worn. The pillows were terrible - they were actually lumpy (which I can say I have never experienced before!). Bathroom was fine. The buffet breakfast was a total ripoff for 30 euro (but it does have a great view). We got a 2-for-1 coupon, but I would not go back. Totally not worth it - go down the street to the Westin and go to their coffee bar. We got croissants and coffee there for about 6 euro total. The Marriott did not seem to have a cafe - just the main restaurant. Location of this hotel is good - we could walk to the Spanish Steps area. The staff at the Marriott were friendly. The concierge was helpful when we arrived, and the doorman was always pleasent. Housekeeping was fine - no complaints. So, overall, it was fine. But I would choose another hotel in Rome if I went back. This one was nothing special. Review #51:I have stayed at the Grand Flora a number of times and over the years have witnessed a little fluctuation. I am glad to report this recent visit proved me it is indeed back to its best. Everything from the bedroom to the breakfast buffet was absolutely perfect. The rooms are extremely comfortable, clean and well decorated. Service is so good I have to personally name Stefana and Marco, who along with the concierge Massimo went (REALLY) out of their way and through a lot of trouble to grant my every wish, even in a time when they were fully booked. Massimo is a real asset to the Hotel himself. I specially recommend this hotel to Americans due to the size of its rooms (similar to US hotels and way larger than other hotels in Rome), service and quality of the breakfast buffet. Review #52:Everything about this hotel is rather good. But the key word in this phrase is \"rather\". After two stays I can remember nothing that could make me think of Marriott Roma when planning next stay in Rome. Even their fabulous roof terrace with a breath-taking view over the whole centre of Rome left no memories. Maybe because of 2-stars breakfasts with 2-stars service. And maybe that's the reason why this Marriott is the only 4-star hotel among all the other 5-starsMarriott Grand hotels. Review #53:We booked through Costco travel. The Grand Flora Marriott was an elegant hotel. Beautiful marble, quiet, wonderful breakfast, served on the roof overlooking the rooftops of ROme. Absolutely beautiful view. Clean spacious rooms. Great service. Restaurants and shops within steps of the hotel. Lots of cafes along with upscale restaurants. Close to the Spanish Steps. Highly recommended. Next to Borghese Park and Via Veneto. Took a day trip to Pompeii, Vatican picked up in front of hotel. Review #54:We stayed at the Grand Flora with Marriott points, so it was great value for us. We were traveling with 2 teenagers and thus needed 2 rooms. We booked the rooms 10 months prior to our arrival and requested the 2 rooms be next to each other, if not connected. We ended up having our children's room 3 doors down and only 1 room was available when we checked-in around 3pm. The rooms were very nice. Our children's room was standard but our room was very spacious with a little sitting area. The management even sent a box of chocolate and a bottle of wine to our room, since my husband has elite status. A very nice touch. The bathroom was also very clean and nice, bed was very comfortable. Our room came with complimentary rooftop breakfast, but our children did not get that and we were not willing to shell out 30 euros each, so we took turn to eat breakfast. The rooftop restaurant was very pleasant, with a great view. There were plenty of food but we did not find the breakfast food of very high quality. There was a swarm of ants near one of the juice dispensers, kind of disgusting over the crisp and super white linens. We ate outside at the terrace and for a second we were away to get something, a big seagull came zooming down to grab our food. So, make sure at least 1 person sitting at the table if you still want the food. I found the location not very desirable. It is true that the hotel is near 2 metro stations. However, metro stop Barberiini is a bit of a climb back to the Hotel and metro stop Spagna is a long walk through the tunnel to/from the Spanish Steps, very quiet at night. If we have to pay for the hotel, we probably prefer to stay a bit closer to action. I would recommend this hotel to a friend if he/she can stay with points. If they have to pay, there are other choices, provided the Grand Flora is not cheap. Review #55:We stayed here using Marriott Rewards points (call the hotel directly - it's never available on points thru the Marriott 1-800 number or web site), so price wasn't an issue, but it is expensive. This is the former Grand Flora Hotel, a historic property at the top of Via Veneto, across from Borghese Gardens, close to the US Embassy, and a 5-minute walk to the subway. Beautiful small hotel, very elegant. Our room looked out onto the old Roman wall and Borghese Gardens. The rooftop restaurant for breakfast has spectacular views of the city. There is a small business center with hi-speed internet and an exercise facility for those who don't get enough walking the city. The in-house restaurant is OK but nothing to get excited about. Several nice cafes just across the street, lining via Veneto, including Harry's Bar. Great for people-watching. Front desk staff were extremely helpful with sightseeing recommendations and in getting us thru a minor medical issue involving pharmacies and medications. All in all a very positive experience and a lovely property. Review #56:Loved the Flora! We stayed for five nights. We had a nice, large room on the fifth floor with a view of Via Veneto. The location is very good; Via Veneto is a beautiful neighborhood to stay in when you're in Rome. We loved having the park, Villa Borghese, right across the street, for afternoon strolls. The hotel is halfway between two metro stops, but there is a pedestrian tunnel entrance right across the street from the hotel that takes you to the Spagna metro stop, and the Barberini metro stop is only a 5- or 10-minute walk away. We ate dinner in the hotel bar one night and the food was good but not the best we had in Italy. It was expensive; most everything on Via Veneto is and there are plenty of restaurants nearby (if you really want to splurge, Harry's Bar is right across the street). But there is a good bar/gelateria around the corner on Via Sardegna where we went for gelato, Cokes, snacks, etc., instead of raiding the minibar in our room. We had great service from everyone in the hotel: front desk, concierge, housekeeping, everybody. We got spoiled with the Peyrano chocolates that were left during the turndown service every night and were thrilled to find out that there's a Peyrano store on the corner. Review #57:I booked my trip as a group, however it turned out I only needed 2 rooms, 1 double and 1 triple. Thank GOD I got there before my guest because they did not have my reservation. They cleared everything up and I thought my trip to Rome would be perfect. I was wrong! To cut to the chase, my last night as I was getting dressed for bed I saw my tote bag open and money hanging out. I thought that was strange because I had the pocket closed and money in that bag for over 6 weeks. Well, the theft let me with $11 American dollars. That is where all the nastiness started. I went down to the front desk to complain where I was told that could have been because the staff there had been there for over 30 years. After that it was a series of am I sure I had the money, I should not have left it in my bag, maybe I left it in the other room... And, yes it gets worse, the next morning when I went to breakfast I put the DO NOT ENTER light on. When I came back from breakfast there were 2 women with the room to my door open. I had to stare them down for them to tell me who they were. I thought this was not professional, as sercuity they should have known better. This hotel was in a good location for me, but after all of that I will NEVER stay here again!! ! Review #58:We paid for this room with Marriott points or there is no way we could have afforded it. It was really expensive. But, they knew it was our honeymoon. They upgraded us to an AMAZING junior suite (with a patio that was bigger than the livingroom in our apartment! ), and we had a very nice note and bottle of champagne waiting for us. They were super cool with us being in Rome for the first time. They helped us with places to eat and how long of walk things were, etc. The hotel restaurant was too expensive for our blood. 22 bucks on average for breakfast if I remember right. But the hotel is beautiful, quite, and fabulous! And the location is awesome. It is in a rich part of town, low crime, near famous hot spots, and if you are seriously craving American food and serving sizes, the Hard Rock is walking distance. This is a hotel the celebrities stay in apparently. Laaa-te-da! We stayed there because the location was close enough that we walked/hiked to the colussium from there. Not a short walk, but certainly do-able if you're in decent shape. Note it was November, this might not be true in the Summer heat. Review #59:The Marriott Flora is a very nice hotel. It's a little pricey however consider the money you will save by not having to take a taxi ANYWHERE except the Vatican. Service was very excellent, friendly staff etc. I would suggest eating at restaurants off Via Veneto not because they are less expensive but because ther are so many great restuarants off the main Via. If you are a frequent traveler and are familar witrh Marriot's level of service you will not be disappointed. I also would recommend to shop for snacks and beverages down the escalator accross the street it will save you alot of $$$. AMM. Review #60:Our stay in Rome was greatly enhanced by the friendly and helpful staff of this hotel. We arrived at nine am on Friday morning and were able to check in early, which allowed us to freshen up and enjoy a full day in Rome. The concierge and staff all spoke English and helped us with directions to all of our meeting points in a prompt and friendly manner. They also made arrangements for our transportation to and from the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and clean. Our room, a junior suite, was comfortable and the bathroom well appointed with linens and supplies. The shower water pressure was outstanding! Internet connection was conveniently available in both our room and the main lobby. A wonderful place to stay for an American's first trip to Rome. My only complaint would be the loud noise of a truck that awoke us two days in a row at around 6am coming from the streeet adjacent to our room. Review #61:Disappointing. Room cleaned very late in day. Music from bar can be heard at night. Breakfast buffet is supposed to end at 10:30 a.m. but they do not replenish the buffet after 10 even when there is no bread left and start taking down tables at 10:15 while people are trying to eat. This is not how a first rate hotel treats guests! Review #62:I was here from May 22 through the 28th. The location was great and the hotel was charming. Each room those in our group had were unique - mine was small with a large bathroom and windows that looked out to the space between the buildings. It was amazingly quiet and comfortable. The bed was very nice and the housekeeping staff was very pleasant and courteous. The best start to my day was the breakfast buffet on the 7th floor. I was able to enjoy the view of the city while sipping an espresso. Since the next stop was the office, it was important to soak in the view and some sunshine first. The lobby staff was very efficient and gracious and I enjoyed the service in the bar as well. All in all, a great stay. Review #63:After my time in Venice (which I hated) I was really looking forward to getting to Rome and was very relieved to get to a Mariott again. From the moment I checked in to the time I checked out, the staff at the Grand Flora were just fantastic. Escpecially Alberto at the front desk--he was always so accomodating and attentive. Even when he had to keep connecting me to all my phone calls! This hotel is on the gorgeous Via Veneto right next to the incredibly beautiful Villa Borghese Gardens. I had a nice stroll through these gardens every morning after breakfast and before the hectic pace of Rome took over my day--it was sublime. The Room: Clean, comfortable and spacious with a HUGE bathroom. Loved it. Not the greatest view in the world but I was hardly in the room--there is so much to do and see (and eat!) in Roma. The breakfast buffet was perfect but what was even more perfect is the view you get of the city while sipping your coffee. Amazing. (I attached some pics) For the buffet, they had your typical European assortment of food; eggs (hardboiled or scrambled) a selection of cheese and meats, tons of breads/pastries, an assortment of juices etc, etc. It was not lacking anything. Also, Donatella at the front desk was always courteous and accomodating---so were the other dining room staff. If you're going to be in Rome for a few days, it's worth it to purchase the Roma Pass (25 euros) which allows you free access to ALL transit plus gets you in free to 2 museums/monuments. All the others, you get a discount on. You can't use it for The Vatican though--that's a seperate fee. The Galleria Borghese museum is about a 5 min walk from the hotel so don't forget to see it--another absolute MUST while in Rome. Review #64:My husband and I traveled to Italy in February. We stayed at this hotel using points. We were upgraded to a suite. The room was a corner room in the from of the hotel. We were one floor below the rooftop restaurant. So we had the smells of bacon and coffee every morning. Also, breakfast was included with our stay. It was a large spread with eggs, meats, cheeses, breads, fruits and juices. The staff at this hotel were very helpful. They were really helpful with reservations and updates on closings since we were there during the snow storm. Our views from our hotel room looked over the Villa Borghese. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. It was a great stay! Review #65:Myself and my family stayed here for a second time (first being without kids) and it was perfect. We had a suite which was fantastic and spacious and enough room for us all. The kids got a little present each and we also got a bottle of champagne and chocolates for us adults in our room. The staff are also great especially Marco who organised everything for us. Overall a great stay and will definiately be back. Review #66:Our family of four stayed in two rooms at the Flora for four nights in December 2009. We thought the location was ideal. It is across the street from the Rome wall and the Borghese park, which is lovely. It is a quiet and relaxing place to stay. We enjoyed the walk to the center of Rome -- it is at least a 15 minute walk to just about all attractions and a 10-15 minute walk the Spagna and Barberini metro stations. It is also easy to get a taxi right outside, so if you don't want to walk, it is not a problem. The room design is a bit tired, but the excellent service and free internet access compensate. The staff were the best we experienced in Italy (and we thought the staff was very good everywhere we stayed). Special thanks to Massimo at the concierge desk and Sonia at reception. If you use Marriott points, you will definitely not be disappointed! Review #67:We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and loved the location and the service. My husband is platinum with marriott and we stayed here on points. It is pretty pricey but worth it for me since I am somewhat of a hotel snob. The breakfast at the rooftop terrace was amazing. The choice were good but the view was marvelous. The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of sights. You can walk to Spanish steps (I highly recommend walking there, it's just lively and beautiful), Borghese gardens are just next door and the Trevi fountain is not a bad walk eiher. The hop on hop off tour left accross from the Savoy hotel which is also a block away. There were many places to eat but our favorite was San Marco, a local joint that the Conceirge recommended. It was friendly, casual and great food. We also took a day trip to Capri and a trip to the Vatican that the Conceirge helped with and that was great as well. Overall Rome is really really beautiful and the people I found very friendly and most people spoke good English. I highly recommend the hotel if you can get a room there on points (it's actually pretty hard to get room there on points) or if you can afford to pay the high price. To me it's worth the money when you are there for a short time and are looking for a nice hotel in a great location . Review #68:We stayed at the Marriott Rome Flora for 3 nights in September. The hotel is in a wonderful location on the Via Veneto. While not super luxurious, the room was cozy, comfortable and very clean. The service was top notch. Loved sitting on the roof for breakfast....the views were absolutely breathtaking. I would definately stay here again. Review #69:My wife and I recently stayed at the Flora on a short stop-over in Rome to elsewhere in Italy. The room was very nice and large by European standards, overlooking a large park. The bathroom and public areas were exceptionally nice. We stayed on hotel loyalty points and were upgraded to the executive level. Breakfast on the top level overlooked the city and the view, food, and service were all tremendous. The staff was very polite and helpful in resolving a luggage issue with our airline. This is not the most convenient location in Rome, but it is in a very attractive area that is quieter than a lot of the city. I would very much recommend this hotel. Review #70:My husband and I stayed here for three nights in November. yes, it was pricey but we stayed at other properties with a comparable rate which couldn't hold a candle to this one. We loved the location and the excellent service we received. We were impressed with the staff overall. Any questions we had about the area, tours, and restaurants were answered. We plan to return with our grown children for another amazing stay. We had a great experience with the buffet when we were there; but we don't eat a traditional 'american' breakfast . We would rather experience the local foods. There were many local restaurants we tried within walking distance with wonderful food and prices comparable to the rest of Rome. Grand property and we would definitely go back again! Review #71:It is rated a five star hotel and the first appearance is really great. Doorman, helpful staff at the front desk and a very luxurious appearance. Finding the room is a different story. I got a room I had to find in the background of the hotel. I did ask for a quiet room... Ok depending what are you used to but having the trash cans in front of the window and same is true for the taxi cue. Unfortunately the windows could not been closed. Bathroom: well let me put is this way.. Last renovation is somewhat 20 years ago.... Bar: sorry to bother the batman with the desire of an ordinary espresso... There is a lot of light but some really dark shadows here Review #72:Very pretty hotel on Via Veneto. Our room was an upgrade on the fifth floor. Very large by European standards. Even though it was on the front of the hotel and in the corner we did not have any trouble with street noise. The bathroom was wonderful. Rather expensive. Staff was very good. I would not recommend the breakfast on the terrace. It is expensive and the food is just so so. You can still take in the terrace view by exiting the elevator to the left on the seventh floor. The hotel is not particularly close to Rome's main attractions, but we don't mind walking a little. Everything on Via Veneto is expensive so be aware of that before you stay there. For us, it was worth it. Review #73:We stayed at the Marriott for 8 nights and we had a great time at this hotel. Our room was ready as soon as we checked in, the room was big for european standards and very well kept and clean. The breakfast in the hotel's top floor was amazing, and the bar in the first floor was a great place to unwind and relax after a day of walking all over Rome. The location of the hotel was very good because even though you are located in the city center the hotel is located in an area that is not crowded by tourists. It is true that there is a Metro Station across the street from the hotel, but once you enter the station you have to walk a good 15 minutes in order to reach the actual metro, so keep that in mind when planing a metro trip from the hotel. There is a Taxi Station half a block away. Review #74:For our 25th wedding anniversary we traveled to Italy and stayed at this lovely hotel for the last 5 days of our trip. The hotel is really beautiful, our room was spacious, very clean and had a large, modern bathroom. The staff was very helpful and attentive. The breakfast buffet on the rooftop terrace was excellent-it had everything from pancakes and fresh fruit to pastries and meats. The view was amazing. The location was great- very near to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. The concierge was so helpful- lots of recommendations for well priced restaurants and the best way to get everywhere. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again. Review #75:This was a great place to stay while visiting Rome, we would highly recomend it. My wife and I stayed there for 6 nights and it was a terrific location with a terrific staff. It is on the Via Venetto and right outside of the Villa Borguese Park, where I went running every morning and you have one of Fodor's pick for museums in Rome. Other places, the farthest walk you will ever have is 30 minutes and that is to the Vatican. We planned our walking trips around different paths to make the walk worth while. Addtionally, the hotel is down the street from the US Embassy. The room that we were in was huge, probably one of the largest hotel rooms we had stayed at. One reviewer said that the JW Marriott was better on Capri and you really can't compare. We liked Capri and the JW Marriott there better, but I would attribute that to personal taste. Also, the business center computers are free. A rarity for any hotel. A suggestion, Rome is a noisy City and if you are a light sleeper then I suggest try to get an inside room. While it is going to be darker during the day, it will be quieter and who cares if you are gone looking at the sites most of the days. If you are on an outside room, like us, then make sure you close the heavy draperies at night they will insulate the sound. The Beds are not the new Marriott beds, but the International Hotels usually lag behind the American. We had a King size bed, but was really 2 twins pushed together, a European thing. We would definately stay there again while visiting Rome, however our next trip will to return to Capri to stay at the JW Marriott. Review #76:We used Marriott points to book two room at the Marriott Grand Flora for three nights. One of the rooms was smaller and in the interior; the other was very spacious and on the street. The room on the street was a bit louder. Because we used points, breakfast was not included. The hotel is on a lovely street near the Borghese Gardens but easy to walk to sites or to catch taxis. The staff was helpful and we liked the location. It was particularly nice to be able to use points since Rome hotel rooms are pricey and generally small - by contrast, the Marriott was very nice. Review #77:Nice hotel, but I was in Rome and hoping for something that made me feel like I was in Italy. This hotel could have been anywhere. I was also there for Christmas, but you wouldn't have known it from the lack of anything festive. It was also a lousy location for a tourist, being on a large busy street and not close to very many attractions. My room was small with a view of a wall which had windows that had been \"concreted up.\" However, the biggest disappointment was that I am a Marriott platinum but got what could have been the worst room in the hotel. I went back to ask if there was a room with a view of anything other than a wall and was told the hotel was full. (I then went on-line and tried booking three rooms for that night and learned there was availability in various room levels.) The staff recommended that I check back every day to see if a better room became available. Instead I checked out and forgoed the free breakfast (which was in a beautiful space, but not great food) and free Internet to stay at a comparable hotel that was on a quiet street in a great tourist and shopping location with old world Italian elegance. However, if you are there on business, this hotel is up to Marriott standards in terms of cleanliness, safety, and amenities. Review #78:One of the best hotels in Rome, great location! The staff was wonderful! If you was american amenities in Italy stay here. It is within walking distance of historic Rome just down the street from the American Embassy and across the street from the Borgese Gardens Review #79:I stayed here for one night in between flights and would definitely consider coming back when I had more time to spend. This is a lovely hotel, with world-class service, as one would expect from a Marriott. It is both a large hotel and part of a world-wide chain. This has both advantages and disadvantages. Perhaps one of the disadvantages is that it's missing the charm of a small hotel. In this case, though, the advantages far outweigh that disadvantage. The hotel is in a great location, near subway lines, a short walk to the Spanish steps, and just outside the Borghese Gardens. I stayed in one of the smaller, least expensive rooms, which was generously sized for 1 but might be a bit crowded with 2 people. The view was toward other rooms, which was just fine for an overnight stay, and very quiet. The bathroom was pretty, well lit, very clean, and well laid out. If you can afford the 30 euros (or if it's included with your room), the breakfast is well worth trying. The front desk staff was professional, helpful, and courteous. Review #80:Beautiful hotel, great location. Stayed for 3 nights in April and booked 2 executive rooms. As hotel was busy one room was upgraded to a suite. I was a little disappointed with the executive room (it was large but nothing special) for the money paid (375 Euros a night) however the suite was excellent with a seperate lounge area. Service was superb and the staff were very freindly and all spoke excellent english (as most Italians seem to do). Location is superb on Via Venetto next to Villa Borghese. Numerous quality restaurants nearby (would recommend Cafe De Paris and Eden Hotel) and also many cheaper cafe;s down the sidestreets so choice to suit all pockets. Vatican and Colloseum are walkable (30- 40 minutes) with much to see on the way. Overall a very enjoyable stay however dont pay much extra for the exec room as its not worth it (but I would recommend the suites). Review #81:It was our first trip to Rome, and being a Marriott guest in the US we knew we would be treated in the same quality...... and we not disappointed. We stayed before our Mediterrean cruise and afterwards, as well. The front desk was always helpful. The people friendly. You must have a meal in the roof top restaurant. Eat out side and just take in all of Rome... When we return to Rome, we will go back to the Grand Flora Marijane & Hank Review #82:We stayed at the Grand Flora on Marriott points in the middle of May 2007. The rooms were as expected at a Marriott with this star rating, well decorated with lovely marble baths. The best part was the breakfast terrace -- an AMAZING view of the Villa Borghese and all of Rome all the way to the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. The buffet was plentiful and always started our day off with satisfied stomachs. The staff was EXTREMELY helpful, especially Giacomo and Marco. (At this point, if our concierge Giacomo told me to walk off a bridge I would do it -- his recommendations were that on point.) Also appreciated the free internet access, though it would be even better if it was wireless. Review #83:Location is very important in Rome and this hotel is on the nicest street in Rome, the Via Veneto. The hotel is very pretty and the accomodations very nice. Our room wasn't large but there were 12 foot ceilings and large windows so it felt larger than it was. We used Marriott points for our stay and breakfast was included which was nicely presented with an excellent assortment. The staff was very helpful especially in recommending very good restaurants. There are so many choices that it is nice to have a recommendation. We had the Fodors Rome book but found that as far as restaurants go it was useless. It has names according to areas but no addresses. The hotel was walking distance to many of the sights. We took the metro to Ancient Rome but walked to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon... We had a wonderful time in Rome. Favorite day was spent in Ancient Rome. Awesome. Palantine Hill requires a ticket but is a must. Plan to spend the whole day in that area as the ruins go on and on. Review #84:We stayed using all our Marriott points. If we had paid outright, we would have been outraged. The hotel is incredibly overpriced for what you get. The room was large for a European room, but there were stains on some of the furniture and there was no view from our room. The service was minimal at best (see below). As for the location, it is right across from the Borghese park, which is lovely, but it is not close to anything else. We would suggest staying closer to the main sights. We went to the rooftop for cappucino in the morning and the view was very nice. Do not buy the breakfast, unless it is included in your package. It is very overpriced. We returned to our room at 2:30 for a rest after touring in the heat, and the room was not ready for us. We were told that it would be available soon, but it took them an hour (after multiple reminders) to get it ready. Although they tried to make it up to us (after the hour) offering a free breakfast (which we could not avail ourselves of because of an early flight) and then a room upgrade (why didn't they offer that earlier? ), which we turned down because we didn't want to take the time packing and unpacking. They sent up a bottle of wine and some chocolates a little later. I guess they tried, but we would have just preferred the room availability when we returned. When we asked about transfers to the airport, the concierge offered a private car and then when we said that we had paid half that amount to get to Rome from the airport, he said we could get a cab which has flat rates to the airport. We would not return to this hotel. Review #85:The Grand Flora is an old style hotel that has been made over to provide all of the modern amenities. This is one of the very few Category 8 hotels in the Marriott chain. It is located in one of the most scenic areas of Rome and is conveniently located to many of the sights that most visitors would want to see. The service was fantastic. Everyone form the doormen to the concierge could not have ben more helpful as they went out of their way to make this a most pleasant stay. We would higly recommend this hotel to anyone considering a visit to Rome. Review #86:This was a beautiful hotel with an ideal location for walking and travel by car out of town. The rooms were nice and very clean. Our view wasn't so great but overall it was a beautifu hotel. I felt the staff were a bit rude at times and I felt they didn't want to be bothered by an American. When I asked to send a letter and how much it would cost, the gal at the counter shook the the letter and said she wasn't sure. There were times when the front desk staff wouldn't even look up at me for assistance. Nice hotel, the Marriott name does carry weight but I had no use for the front desk help and there was a bell boy or someone who kept talking on his cell phone while he was working and was a bit upset that I had luggage in the lobby sitting while I was waiting for my spouse to come pick me up and the luggage up by car. The location was ideal and the are beautiful. Very expensive. Review #87:We arrived at the hotel at 8:30 AM and they gave us a beautiful room on the top floor with two balconies and a view of the Roman Wall. We also were using points and were treated great. The room was large with a king bed. They recommended some great places to eat that we visited and the staff always went the extra mile. We had breakfast included, but if you have to pay it is about 30 E a person and rather high. We were with friends and I got them to give them 50% off the meal. Pays to ask. Will stay here again next year. Review #88:This Marriott was really great - it felt more like an Italian brand rather than American; not that I am anti-American hotels, it's just that we like to get the local flavor. The only downside was the restaurants on this street were either way over-priced or too touristy. Review #89:My wife and I stayed at the Grand Flora in May of 2007. From a roof top restaurant offering a breakfast view of St. Peters dome, a \u2018La dolce vita\u2019 address and close proximity to the Rome Metro and Villa Borghese the location is priceless. As platinum Marriott members we expect to be treated well but the Flora staff has exceeded and reset our expectations. The Concierge desk helped us get great tickets to local events, helped me catch up from 20 years absence from Roma and recommended us to a wonderful restaurant around the corner. The entire staff seemed committed to anticipating our desires and satisfying them. Our room was comfortable and spotless. We enjoyed the gourmet chocolates on our bed; these were not your usual hotel good night chocolate. If you are taking a cab from the airport or train station ask to be taken to the Hotel Flora. This property has been the Hotel Flora for many years but only recently a Marriott property. We found that asking to be driven to the Marriott often yielded blank looks from cab drivers but mentioning the Flora seemed to work without fail. On our last visit my wife talked me into leaving my computer at home. Never again! The Flora\u2019s \u2018business center\u2019 has a single internet connected computer and was monopolized by young adults in the evenings. Internet connectivity is free in the rooms, remember to bring your computer! I should mention that this is an expensive hotel but you really get your money\u2019s worth in terms of quality service, property and location. La dolce vita! Roma will be a more frequent destination just so we can enjoy a few days at this fine hotel. Review #90:The folks that work here are so great. Very accommodating, kind and helpful. I got the free breakfast with my upgrades. The room is typical European size, but the real issue is the location. Harry's Bar is great across the street and the Spanish steps are a short walk but any of the other \"touristy\" destinations are going to be somewhat of a walk. I love a long walk and exploring, but for others hoping for quick easy trips it may not be the ideal situation. I did not use the Metro, but there is a metro stop less than 4 blocks away - very close! Review #91:3rd stay at Marriott since 2000. Rooms not really updated since then, getting a little tired. Room are smallish, required by hotel to get 3 rooms for family of six. Location is fantastic, easy walk to Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and short cab rides to all other major sites. Front Desk very helpful. Breakfast so so for price, go around corner of hotel on left side to first street, go 25 feet to cafeon right there for great coffee, pastries, lite lunch and geltato. Hotel now allows limited point award stay which compared to $ US 450 per night is way to go. Concierege dinner recommnedations usually overpriced busts. Review #92:My husband and I stayed at the Grand Flora on our honeymoon. Though, we are American and maybe it was to be expected...the staff was incredible rude to us. Any question about restaurants, shopping, etc. was a complete bother to the front desk. I am a Marriott Gold Member and was refused a room upgrade...we had a lovely view of the side of a building and garbage dumpsters. Review #93:We just returned from two weeks in Italy, the final four days were spent in Rome, where we stayed at the Marriot Grand Flora ( which most Taxi drivers only seem to know as the Flora). I'm not sure what the source of some of the gripes I've read from other travellers are about. This Hotel was top notch. The wife and I are from the NYC area, and she especially is very demanding in her accomodations. She was ecstatic with our choice of the Flora. The king size bed in our room (room 115) was the most comfortable of our entire Italy trip. The hotel was classically and classily appointed. The staff were attentive and helpfull. The breakfast buffet was grand. The location just outside the Villa Borghese is among the best in the entire city. All this comes at a price, but that should be no surprise to anyone who has stayed at a fine hotel in any world class city. I've spent more on a room in Boston. I would recomend this hotel to anyone. Review #94:This deluxe Marriott at the end of the Via Veneto is a classy experience by anyone's standards. Contrary to some comments posted elesehwere the hotel is trivial to access by public transport with an underground/metro entrance across the street (though it connects to a tunnel that is around a quarter mile walk to the spanish steps metro station). I would recommend the first time user starting from the hotel rather than the station, learning the tunnel, and then it is easy after that, a bit of a maze and you need to find the right borghese escalator to get to the front door of the hotel). So, with the cheap and reliable metro access to all of the sites you will want to visit (Varican, colliseum, so on for only 1 Euro per ride) the other pluses are that this is a relatively calm and classy area of Rome, no one hustling you, plentiful expensive and also value restaurants to choose from, a safe, ATM filled neightborhood with the old Roman wall outside the door. The concierge and front deck folks were courteous and of Marriott standards, which may sound obvious but in Rome sometimes that is appreciated! This is an expensive hotel and one of the premier Marriott properties, but I would go back in an instant, I am a Marriott frequent guest but I do see the faults at some of their properites, there were none to be found here (with perhaps the exception that the gym is somewhat lame, if you feel the need to have the full equipped workout room this hotel disappoints in that area versus many other Marriotts). Review #95:I just reurned from a great stay at this hotel. The room was nice. The location is excelent. The service was great. A Concierge named Danielle made a dinner reservation for us at Da Bolognse 30 days before our arrival. Another Concierge named Bernardo was very nice, and sent us to some great places. The view at the rooftop at breakfast every morning was fantastic! I will go back. Review #96:The hotel was beautiful, and the room was a decent size. Our stay was paid via Marriott rewards points. Location was decent, we found everything within walking distance. We are both in our low 30s and enjoyed walking around. We walked to everything except the Vatican, in which we got the Subway which is approximately 10 minute walk. A cab is needed to go to the train station if you have a lot of luggage, but walkable if you just have carry on sized luggage. The free internet, and good staff service was great. Not sure I would spend $600+ a night to stay here, but with the reward points it was great! ! Review #97:Stayed here using Marriott points for three days this summer. Arrived earlier than the standard check-in, and our original room was not ready. The front desk staff was very nice and offered a non-view room that was available, but then worked hard and found us a room with a view. All of the staff we met were extremely helpful. Breakfast buffet was included in our room rate, and it was standard for European hotel breakfasts. We were doing a morning tour of the Vatican and just wanted a soda to go, and they brought out two sodas and a small box so that we could take muffins with us. The room was small for US standards, but pretty typical for Europe, and the quality was that of a good Marriott, so no surprises there. Location is a short walk to the Spanish Steps, and a long walk to the Forum and things on that side of town. It is not a posh hotel, but it is a quality Marriott, and everything about the stay was just fine. Review #98:I was impressed by this hotel from all aspects. I had the most amazing sleep in my life here. The bed was so comfortable, pillows were like from the TV advert. The curtains were those heavy ones which give you a feeling that is a night even it is a lunch time. The breakfast place in the top floor has a terrace with breathtaking views. It is conveniently located in walking distance from all Roman sightseeing hot spots. It is not a cheap hotel but definitely worth. I can't imagine anyone would get disappointed here! Review #99:This is one of Marriott's category 8 properties and was very happy to use points to stay here. I arrived via train and took a cab to the hotel. I can't recall the amount but it was reasonable. This is a VERY nice Marriott and you feel very worldly staying here. I was glad to be dressed up upon check in! Hotel staff friendly and no issues with check in. Concierge was helpful and provided good intel on the local attractions. Rooms were very small by US standards, but this is Italy. My room was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Can't say the view was good although when staying on points you rarely get anything good these days. That is a Marriott issue, not the hotel itself. Used room service for a light snack and the food was delivered promptly. Many of the tourist attractions are close and there's ample shopping and dining near the hotel. The concierge lounge was really nice with rooftop seating. It was a cold day during my stay, but I did venture out for some pictures. Breakfast was really good with many American and European options. I would recommend the hotel due to its location and because it is a really nice property. Even better recommendation if you have Marriott points. When in Rome, right? Hope this helps.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The bathroom smelled like sewer water, the front door couldn't open wider, it felt like we were in a motel. Why would marriott make this kind of hotel but it really is not a hotel it's a motel. I don't recamand this hotel (motel). Review #1:Was a bit further away from all the downtown Key West activities than I expected, but nice facility. Helpful staff. Very nice pool area and great free breakfast buffet in the pool area. Room was kind of cramped with very small bathroom. Not a lot of storage or room to put your suitcases, but adequate. I know I read reviews before about the air conditioning units being loud and it's true. If you are a light sleeper, I'd take ear plugs. Only real complaint I have is the pool area is supposed to close at 11:00. All the rooms open up to the pool area, so any activity out there at night can be heard. There was a large group of mostly men that decided to play dominoes. The constant talking and shuffling of the dominoes on the tables echoed throughout the courtyard area and had to be keeping everyone awake. This went on until 2am or so. I would have thought the hotel staff would have cleared them out. Review #2:I found this hotel to be a perfect location for a fun weekend in Key West. The room layouts were unique, spacious and clean. The pool area provided a quiet nice hide away for the morning after the night on the town. This hotel was a quick 5 minute, or $4/person cab ride to Duval St. and dozens of restaurants and pubs. Close to everything, but not a walk to downtown. Review #3:We recently stayed here during our 2 days in Key West. It was quiet, rooms were clean, staff pleasant. The pool is awesome with 12 small fountains spraying into it during the day. Complimentary breakfast is served poolside--nothing spectacular on the menu, but it's a very pleasant way to start the day. Would recommend it, although farther up the island (northeast?) are other places that are directly across from the seawall and might offer better Gulf access/views. Review #4:Just got back from Key West for my sister's 30th. Key West is GREAT! But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what this review is for - Fairfield Inn offered a great front desk team. They were very attentive, informative and friendly. Whether you needed a cab, directions or suggestions on where to eat - what beach to visit - or the best night club, they offered a long list of suggestions with pros and cons. The rooms were quite small though. There were 3 girls in ours and we constantly needed to move out of the way for someone to walk by. However, the beds were GREAT! Very soft and cozy (down pillows). Room 222 offers a lovely view - of the Taco Bell's roof next to the hotel too! Also, this is more of a motel (rather than hotel) - so not sure why they didn't have seats outside the rooms - seemed to have enough room. The pool was very refreshing, and a nice size with plenty of chairs - you never had that feel that the pool was over crowed. My big beef was the location. We took a cab about 4 times a day into Downtown or the beach. With being 5 of us (about $20 a ride) - this was split and generally inexpensive - but I think next time I visit Key West, I'll buck up the extra money and stay at a better location Review #5:The Fairfield Inn is the absolute best value and the staff is nothing short of fantastic. From Lyndsey and the girls at the front desk to Pete our daily bartender to the sweetest breakfast staff, they are what made our trip so memorable. Can't thank you enough for showing our family such hospitality! Review #6:Yes the hotel is a bit far from Old Key West, but we walked and had bikes and it worked for us- Service- very proffesional staff- Front desk, pool bar and breakfast staff were all friendly and had a nice greeting each time we walked by. The pool was clean and never crowded. Another note on service- we had a room without a fridge-we asked for one at check-in and we were told it would be right up( we expected a long wait) we put our luggage on the bed and there was a knock on door and the fridge was delivered! Other nice touches-the internet is free and there are TWO computers with a printer right off lobby. There is a bike rental on site and the bike/scooter storage rack is in garage and covered and safe.The breakfast is more than enough to get you started for the day- Taxis were always waiting and there is a Trolley Stop on site ( Trolley is $$$$ -walk, rent a bike or try the public bus) We totally agree on the LOUD air conditioner-we had to shut it off at night- we turned it down as cold as it could before we went to bed and then shut it down- Review #7:The staff was very Friendly and helpful. They had some good info for our sightseeing. The room was very clean. It was a little small but ok for our needs. The A/C was a little noisey but you get used to it. I would reccomend this place to friends and family. Review #8:Overall the hotel is old, the reception area is good, the pool area very good, but the rooms are awful, we stayed in room 118, the tv remote did not work (ok you can live with that), the air con did not work on auto so had to be on all the time to keep the room at a comfortbale temperature, the drains had a problem in the shower, when you took a shower there was a terrible sewarage smell, the room was small and shabby, but on a positive side the bedding and towels were clean. I did complain about the room at reception and they apologised and we were only staying the one night. Review #9:The wife and I are fresh back from 3 days at the Fairfield inn Key West. What a great experience. The Fairfield was very clean and appeared to be recently remodeled. The pool was a great place to kick back and relax before heading down to Duval to be with the crazies. The breakfast was better than most places with a great selection. Starting off the day sitting outside having our first cup of coffee poolside was the best. Most of all the Staff was very sincere about our helping us out and could not do enough to make sure we had a great stay day. They succeeded! Review #10:We recently visited Key West for a wedding and chose the Fairfield because it carries the Marriott name and had a great rate. We were not disappointed! The rooms were clean, comfortable and the beds ideal for a good night's sleep. The grounds and pool area were extremely clean and well kept. The pool is fantastic and being able to enjoy a complimentary breakfast out there each morning was wonderful. They have a special server named Mirella who took great care of us every day we were there! She is one of the best service industry employees I have encountered in a long time!! The hotel ia close enough to downtown Key West, but without the noise or crowds. It's a quick drive to Duval, where you can find whatever you might want to do. Overall, property was a great value for the price! A few negatives (which were greatly outweighed by positives): Rooms do not have mini-refrigerators (bring a cooler! ); the doors are heavy, hurricane style and slam loudly; and on the back side of the building lives a rooster who will let you know when it's dawn. (If your A/C is on, you probably won't ever hear him though.) Review #11:The room was fairly small, not a suite room. The bathroom had an interesting smell. The rooms are loud. You can hear the people in the adjacent room and if anyone is rolling a suit case down the walk, you will hear it. The staff were extremely friendly which is why I would recommend staying here. It is not typical to spend the whole amount of time in your room on vacation, so as long as it is a place to stay, it is worth it. I was able to book last minute with them and it was worth the trip. It does require a taxi to get downtown, but old charter row is a short walk away. For the fisher, it is a great place to be. Review #12:We almost always stay at Marriott hotels and when we saw the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Key West was a category 5, we made a reservation for two nights. The staff was really great and helpful but the hotel itself was not quite as modern as we expected. One advantage it did have was being a stop on the Old Town Trolley so it was easy to get around but I think next time we would stay closer to downtown. Loved Key West! Review #13:Not impressed with the front desk staff at all- they could not have cared less. No welcome package or thank you to Marriott reward holders. Room was spacious, bed comfortable, but the noise level when you are facing the pool late in the night was bothersome. Gusts making loud noises late into the night did not make for a restful sleep. The bathroom was not clean at all. Glad I was only staying one night, sorry I had to use up all those points. After unpacking went to the bar area and then the front desk to get a few glasses- they do not exist on the property. What a shame, who wants to drink good bourbon out of Styrofoam. The best part was the bicycle rental kiosk on the property. The gentleman there was kind and efficient. Rental price inexpensive, bike functioned and with a basket and lock- everything you need for the 2 mile hike into town for the day. Review #14:If you are going to Key West, stay here! Great pool area and breakfast area. The breakfast area is all open and around the pool area. Beautiful pool area! Plenty of chairs to lay around in and the pool is large enough so you have plenty of room even with a large number of guests. Rooms are very, very small and have very minimal decor/furnishings (the only negative) but the pool area makes this hotel worth it. We have stayed here several times. Only had one bad experience and that was because it was biker week. Since the parking is directly under the rooms, it was Very loud espcially from 12-3 am. We are just more cautious about when we go to the Keys! We will stay at this location every visit. Review #15:Our room was small but very nicely appointed. The hotel itself was very attractive and the staff was welcoming and helpful. Sitting by the pool with its tropical garden, relaxing while having breakfast or an evening drink was great. The location was good and the price reasonable for Key West. Review #16:If you're looking for somewhere to stay at Key West, you'll probably experience sticker shock. I never found anything \"cheap\" that looked appealing enough for me to stay in it. The Fairfield was by far the best value. It has free parking (a big deal in Key West), an awesome pool, and the best free continental breakfast I've ever seen. The staff is extremely friendly as well. The rooms are small but appear recently redone, and I loved the tiled shower. The hotel is a short drive from all the main attractions in Key West, I believe one of the trolley companies also picks up in the parking lot. This is a great value and nice place to stay during your trip to Key West. Review #17:The grounds are beautiful, and the staff is excellent. Continental breakfast was great. There is free parking though it is too far to walk to the beaches and Duval St. from the hotel. However, nothing else was good about the hotel. The rooms are very small. Our room smelled strongly of mildew. The rooms need much better housekeeping and a thorough cleaning. The hotel is on a main thoroughfare and rather noisy at night with cars, scooters, motorcycles passing through. The uncomfortable beds creaked and squeaked. This is by far the worst Fairfield Inn, we have stayed at. Review #18:We were very positively surprised by our stay at The Fairfield Inn in Key West--the staff greeted us warmly, provided useful discount coupons for several restaurants in town and were genuinely pleasant to deal with for the 3 days we stayed--including extending our checkout on a very popular weekend. The hotel is remodeled and the rooms are very adequate, the breakfast included in the room rate provided was really quite good with a broad assortment of food. The fitness room had relatively new equipment. The pool is really quite amazing. It is located within 5-7 minutes of Duval Street. Unlike some other reviews, we found that it was quiet and did not encounter any road noise. The free wifi worked quite well. Review #19:Overall this hotel was like staying at a motel 6. The room was so small I felt like the walls were closing in on me. The room also needed some heavy duty cleaning there was dust on the walls so thick that when the air conditioning was on the dust would blow everywhere. In the shower there was dirt in the corners yuck! We ended up checking out early because it did not feel like a safe place to stay with our family. Review #20:I stayed here with a friend using points. It's the closet of the Marriott hotels to Duval street at about 2 miles away. This hotel does not offer a free shuttle like the other Marriott properties, although it's only about a $10 cab ride down to Duval St. However, it does have a free continental breakfast. The hotel is on N Roosevelt Blvd, which is one of the main roads on the island. The area that it is in is a very commercial area (fast food restaurants, car dealerships, strip malls) but it seems like that is true for most of the chain hotels in Key West. We had a room with two doubles, facing the pool. All rooms appeared to have exterior entrances on the pool side and none appeared to have a personal balcony, just the exterior walkways. The appearance of the room was nice and modern, but the doubles are somewhat small, suites are certainly better. As with all Marriott hotels, the rooms were very clean and the staff were very friendly. The nicest thing about this hotel was its pool area. It was much nicer than I would expect for a Fairfield Inn. There was also an outdoor bar by the pool, I think it stayed open til 7pm. There were a few food/snack options at the bar, but it was mostly there for drinks. If I have the opportunity to stay in Key West again, I would certainly consider this hotel. However, I would likely choose the Courtyard for the free shuttle and slightly nicer rooms. Review #21:Booked a standard room, but could fortunately get a suite. The suites are great! Nice large bed, clean, separate desk and fridge. The standard rooms are very small and do not have any room to store luggage. Very friendly staff at the front desk. Coffee, soda, cookies all for free at the reception area. Great pool and okay gym. Lots of parking space. Just 5 minutes to the old town. Close to shopping and restaurant area's. Review #22:Nice tiles, fresh linen, and clean room. Safe environment. Beautiful pool. Knowledgeable staff helped us get around the island. Don't miss Mallory Square Sunset Celebration and the restaurants on Duval St., many do not accept American Express.Try the sunset catamaran and duo para-sailing. Had a great time! Noisy A/C but would stay again. Review #23:My husband and I did not know what to expect as we had not been to Key West before. This hotel was the cheapest of the chains hotels and we really weren't sure about the accomodations. We were greated by smiling, friendly staff - including the hotel manager - who immediately gave us a drink and mardi gras beads. We found that we had been upgraded to a suite - it was pretty sweet! The pool is georgeous with fountains spraying into the pool (which is heated :o) it made a swim perfect as it was a little chilly out). The room was very nice for the price. These are not 5 star accomodations, but they are the best for the price that you pay. We were able to park under the lights both nights we were there. We would definitely stay here again. Review #24:Our previous hotel offering was a serious disappointment. I booked this in a pinch. Arrived about a half hour after booking. They had all my info ready to go. Check in took all of 3 minutes. The girls were very friendly. Our room was over top of where we parked which was great because we were on a motorcycle. Our room was spotless! A/C was set so the room was cool and comfortable when walking in and not a wall of hot stale air. Bathroom was immaculate as was toilet and sink. Bed was comfortable. Linens were clean. Hotel staff was good about calling a taxi for us. Continental breakfast was okay in the mornings. Could have been better but hey, it was no extra charge! Scooter rental guy was a doll. Gave us a deal and we saved about $70 on two scooters for 8 hours. Gave a complete demonstration about operation of the scooters. Pool area was awesome! Lots of seating areas, chairs, towels, etc. Pool was clean. Pool cleaner guy was there at night taking care of pool. Bar was ok. Drinks were over priced....small plastic cup size frozen drink approx 8oz was $8. Review #25:We stay at Marriotts around the world but never in Key West. So we thought that we would take a chance on this hotel. What a great find. It is located right outside the downtown noise and traffic. Easy to get to all things in \"Key West\". The trolley stopped right in front of the door so we coud leave our car parked. The rooms are bright and ariy and they have the most spectacular pool with a BAR right beside the pool. Having a short swim and a great tropical drink in the sun was a bonus we did not expect. Love this hotel. Review #26:Rooms nothing special; not very spacious and \"weird\" bathroom. Nice breakfast buffet with a lot of different choices (only one type of tea, though). Good location. Friendly staff. We asked for a quiet room when booking online and we probably got the most quiet room at the hotel. Review #27:You get what you pay for! The A/C unit in our hotel room was so loud that we did not get one good nights sleep during our 3 night stay. It sounded like a jet plane taking off every time it kicked on. The bed was very squeaky. The pool was nice, but we did not use it. The breakfast was decent, only because it was free. Had standard continental breakfast items. Now, the biggest complaint........we had a problem with our bill and the Operations Manager, Jeff Emmett, was far from helpful and really needs to be trained in customer service. We had inquired about using a rewards certificate prior to our stay and we were told no problem. When it did not show up on our bill we went to the front desk and we were put into contact with Mr. Emmet. He was very short, told us that there was nothing that he could do, and further told us that there was no one in Marriott that we could call. Finally, he gave us a number to call. The Marriott customer service rep. was very nice and helpful. She asked me to put Mr. Emmett on the phone. He proceeded to argue with her telling her that there was nothing that he can do and and ended up hanging up on her (remember this was a fellow Marriott employee). He ended up fixing it for us, even though earlier he told us that there was not anything that he could do. We are very loyal Marriott customers and timeshare owners and this is not the kind of service that we are used to from Marriott. If this is a franchise, it is no way to represent the \"Marriott\" name. Review #28:This hotel is great. I stayed at the Casa Marina as well during my vacation and in terms of overall value, the Fairfield comes out top every time. The team at the front desk (Ildi, Nora, Kelly and Natalie) were simply awesome, recommending some wonderful trips, they were very friendly and always smiling. They made us feel welcome every time we entered the lobby area and they always called us by our names after we checked in. They are a great bunch of people. The free breakfast, parking and coffee and juice in the lobby just shows how this hotel is different from others In Key West - no rip extra charges. The pool area is fantastic and the rooms are always clean and adequate in terms of size. Thanks for helping us to enjoy our stay and have a great vacation. We will be back Review #29:My family and I stayed at the Fairfield Inn for one night last week. The pool and breakfast areas are certainly beautiful. The older rooms, which I was told were \"gutted and redone\", are still lacking. The door jamb was missing on the first room we were in so the noise from street traffic was unbelievable. The staff were very kind and moved us to a room toward the back. The noise from traffic was less but, the noise from the air conditioner kept us up most of the night. Try to get a suite in the new section of the hotel if booking at this location. Review #30:This Feb of 2008 my wife and I stayed with the Marriot Fairfield Inn and Suites. We had a wonderful time! Checking in was a breeze with the very courtious and respectful staff assisting us with our bags and the introduction to the islands offerings. The staff were able to help us with our planning of trips throughout the three days we stayed, they assisted us with our transportation needs, sunset cruises, and most importantly our resturant choices. Getting around the island, we though would be troublesome, but the staff told us about the new scooter and bike rental company on property, directly next to the pool. We stopped in at the rental place called AHI Rentals and found the rates to be very pleasing to our wallets, we rented two scooters and never had to pay for a cab or any type of parking during our whole trip (saved us so much money and time) The hotel has a wonderful breakfast for a limited selection, jimmy dean sandwiches, bagels, coffee and juices, fruits and cereals. Oh, and the pool! such a wonderful and enjoyable area around the compound. We found the rooms to be very cozy, the beds were comfortable for being away from our own bed at home, and the housekeeping cleaned everything. Checking out was also a so very simple. Under our door was our bill early in the morning. We did not even have to step into the lobby before leaving. High recommendation for the hotel and staff! Thank you very much Review #31:I work for a different hotel chain and have pretty high standards! I could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Fairfield Inn & Suites Key West! The service was wonderful. The lady who was at the front desk most of the time (she was from Hungry) remembered us and was awsome! She accomodated all of our requests. Our room was wonderful. The pool was always great, clean and relaxed. Pete was was always at the Tiki bar to help us out. On our 1st night he recognized that we were \"new\" and asked for our ID\"s ... after that, he knew us by face! The breakfast was adequate and service still great as well! We did have to take a Taxi from the hotel to downtown, however met some great people with wonderful info as a result (Hi Ben from Israel!!). All in all I'd stay here again and give this hotel 2 thumbs up!! Great job! ! Review #32:Almost all of Key West's lodgings are overpriced, so paying $137/night (including taxes) for an average motel/hotel room at the roadside Fairfield is not too bad. But the slightly worn-out rooms are not even as large as at a typical Best Western -- they also lack closets, and the furniture in ours was pretty rickety. Not many electrical outlets either. On the plus side, wi-fi, breakfast and parking are all free. The staff are really A+. From the friendly check-in clerks to the efficient housekeeping and maintenance, everyone who works here seems to genuinely care about guests enjoying their stay. Hurrah! Review #33:The Fairfield was overall a great hotel. I wish it was closer to all of the main attractions like Duval Street or the beaches. It got pricy to take cabs everywhere. The rooms are a bit small so definitely get a suite if you have more than 2 people. The pool area and tiki bar are fabulous with drink specials everyday. They have a nice business center in the lobby. The hallways are all outside and the rooms are detached from the lobby so the elevator was kind of far to drag the luggage to. I would stay here again only if I was looking to only relax by a pool. If you want to go to a beach or enjoy the nightlife, definitely stay somewhere closer to those areas. Review #34:What a fantastic staff. Don & Lindsey were life savers along with Jeff Emmett. My daughters trip would have been ruined not to mention in an unsafe situation if these folks had not gone out of their way to help me. I will always be grateful. Review #35:I really cant say too much about this place other than it is average. I think its easier to do a review in list format: Pro: -Reasonably priced - we paid $159 (without tax) on Jan 2, compared to $3-400 for the rest of Key West -Our check-in staff Andrea was super great and helpful. -Decent location - on the main highway right next to plenty of shopping. 5 minute drive to anywhere in Key West. Is right across from the harbor, so can walk across the highway and have a nice place to sit and watch. -Nice heated pool Neutral: -Breakfast was decent. Typical Fairfield Inn breakfast (however, gotta complain about the plates being so small - can you please supply plates that are at least the size of the waffles?) -Hotel is painted nicely. However, it really shows its age. Con: -Rooms are tiny! We stayed in a King Suite and the bedroom had little room for our luggage. We put the luggage in the living room\" to be able to walk around the bedroom. -Mattresses are horrible! They are probably 10 years old? Every time my wife or I would move on the bed, it would squeak loudly. -Staff outside of lobby are not overly friendly. Seem too much in a hurry to even return my hello... -Seriously, can you please provide coffee throughout the day? Your staff is tired of coming up with excuses on why some days you have coffee in the lobby and others you dont. Im sure its a cost cutting measure, and some staff do go out of their way to help more than others, but get rid of the coffee makers in the room if that will bring back 24 hour coffee in the lobby. I would recommend this hotel to anyone mainly due to the value. If you have money to burn, stay closer to Duval Street. There are several nice inns down there, but they are pricey! Review #36:we arrived late in the evening and had problems finding a room... Mariott was fully booked but for one king... and Courtyard had no vacancy... so we checked in into a 2 queen family room. High season and high demand probably and being in Key West justified the 200 USD. Rooms off the mainroad are alright, but the AC noise is unbearable.. Negative: No wardrobe, a couple of hangers in the corner next to the washingbasin Negative: Curtain next to washbasin is merely hiding the pseudowardrobe and cannot be drwan, so no privacy. Negative: Room to small if suitcases have to lay, stand about the room. Difficult: Not well postsigned and difficult to find, evenings or nights Breakfast was included, basic but ok. We did not use pool, so no comment. Positive: Staff very friendly and helpful, no matter what time of day or night Positive: Free use of Computers in Lobby Positive: Nice Lobby Positive: Plenty of breakfast tables in the shade or in the open sun Review #37:-Visibility/Recognition from road needs to be better. Fairfiled sign in between 2 palm trees - I saw it the day I left. Another sign was obstructed by current construction items. I drove by twice looking for the motel. -Pool Area is beautiful. -Tables for breakfast needed to be wiped off initially and between uses - black film on the table i sat at -My room floor had a black film on surface. When I got in bed my feet bottoms were black. I took a tissue and wiped the floor - black. I asked the desk clerk the next morjning to be sure my room floor was mopped. It was. -Other than the floor, my room was fine. -Staff was helpful. accomodating and delightful. -Good location-, good access. Review #38:I travel to Key West regularly for work and always stay at the Fairfield Inn. It's a great hotel....good location, decent-sized rooms, delicious breakfast and an amazing staff. Nick, the sales manager, always tries to get me the best rates. In addition, everyone at the front desk is always helpful and there to greet you with a smile, especially Beata - she is extremely helpful and was able to quickly resolve booking issues i had the last time i checked-in. I totally recommend this hotel when you are in Key West either for business or pleasure! Review #39:Stayed for one night on a drop in and was a little shocked at the size and quality of the rooms. Marriott is my preferred chain and never disappoints... except this time. Nice friendly staff all around and good service. Nice grounds and decent pool. We did find ants around the sink in room 111 which was off putting. I wouldn't have minded sharing the room with them if we had had a bit more space. First time I have stayed at a Marriott that was so small and dated. Review #40:We took a 2 night 3 day vacation and stayed at the Fairfield Inn in January 2012. We travel a lot and really were impressed with how friendly the staff was and how bright and clean the property was. The pool was big with a lot of lounge chairs. This continental breakfast was amazing with so many wonderful choices . We especially enjoyed the healthy options of fresh fruit,yogurt,and hard boiled eggs. Review #41:We had an excellent experience at your Key West location. The staff was superb especially Olivia who provided the absolute best locations on the island to have great food and drink. This included helping us with reservations on a sunset cruise that we will remember for a life time. This was a long awaited vacation and even with the rain we had for the first 4 days we had an excellent time with the help of your friendly and curteous staff. They kept us smiling throughout. Review #42:Picked the Fairfield Inn mainly for their reputation and the rate. Turned out that it's about 2 miles from most of the downtown attractions (Duval St.). There are several buildings that make-up the property. The front buildings seem new, but the back two buildings have the look of an old 1950's motel that has been repainted and remodeled. We stayed in a room in one of these buildings -- very small room. I mean VERY small. However, it was clean. The \"courtyard\" pool was also nice, and seemed new. The \"tiki bar\" left something to be desired -- especially the bartender. He seemed a little bothered most of the time, and didn't seem to enjoy his position. Would've also been nice to have a waitress circling the pool, taking drink orders. Parking was OK at the hotel, but it's lack of proximity to Duval St. meant driving downtown and paying at least $10 per night to park there. Breakfast was normal Fairfield Inn fare. Price was right -- just nothing special about it. Not a bad place to stay though, even with some of the issues mentioned here. Review #43:I've been at all three of the Key West Marriott Hotels and this is my favorite for value and relaxation. Has a great relaxing pool layout, full continental+ breakfast and on this last visit a staff which worked harder than most travel agents finding some last minute activities and making the bookings for our family. Review #44:The hotel and staff were perfect for our weekend getaway. It was quiet, charming. We were celebrating my 50th birthday. We loved Key West. Great place to get away and have fun! The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our room was perfect and clean. Nice comfortable bed and amenities! We will definetely stay at the Fairfield Inn when we return to Key West! Review #45:We choose the Fairfield Inn for our stay because it was a lower price than the Duval street hotels. While the hotel is not new - (the room was small)- it has been renovated. Our room was clean, the bathroom was clean. The hotel lobby was nice and bright. The pool was beautiful and heated. Each morning the continental breakfast had cereal, muffins, fruit, breakfast sandwiches you could heat and the make your own waffles. The staff was friendly and accommodating. My only disappointment was that our room did not have a small refrigerator. After eating so many wonderful meals it was sad not to be able to take a go box. Also their bar closed at 7 pm. I was pleasantly surprised that we felt safe walking to Duval street and back later in the evening. Be aware that it is a full two mile walk- 1/2 hour at a good clip. There are scooters and bikes to rent at the hotel. Review #46:The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. We had a one bedroom suite which was sufficiently roomy. The bed and the sofa both rated about 5 on a 1 to 10 comfort index. Bathroom was spacious. Internet service was excellent. The room and the property were clean and the pool area is very attractive. Parking is free with some covered parking. The free breakfast is typical Fairfield and is served in an open patio area. This hotel is not within easy walking distance of any restaurants or attractions. Review #47:Very nice property however the pictures on the website was a bit misleading as it gave the impression that the King Suite was much larger than the actual size. We got an end unit which the view from the suite was the concrete wall of the walk way.even when you open the shutters the lighting was poor. The manager Chris, should take a refresher course in guest relations as he was not very tactful in advising me at check that there was no AARP /AAA or Travel Agents rate available. He chose to yell this out very loudly in his response and within ear shot of the other guest who were waiting to check in. He also barked at me that the hotel was FULL. As a Marriott member and a Guest I was really appalled by his demeanor and tone. I will continue to book other hotels in the Marriott chain however not this location. Review #48:Over the last couple years the maintenance and cleaning crew has been slacking. The pool area used to be pristine, now the paver stones are dirty and downright ugly. The landscaping is not being maintained. It is overgrown is some places, dead in others. The outside of the buildings have mold and mildew on them. It needs a good cleaning, which in FL all buildings require a couple times per year. It is a smoke free hotel, but guests tend to sneak smokes in stairwells and in the under building parking, staff does not police this. The interior of the rooms is getting worn down, need a remodel. Overall they keep them up fairly well, some mold and mildew in the shower stalls, the floors are clean, as well as the bathroom counters, sink and toilets. Towels have gotten downright cheap, used to be thin, now they are almost see through. The free breakfast is a plus, especially the staff that works to provide it, they are always helpful and keep the area as clean as they can. Review #49:After we checked in we went to rent scooters from the onsite rental agent (separate business from the hotel). When we went to pay for the deposit on the scooter, to our amazement, our Debit card was declined. This only happens when our spending limit is increased for the day or more obvious we are out of money. Neither of these should have been the case because our room was prepaid months ago. So we had to pay $200 in cash for the deposit on the scooter. Upon further investigation the hotel mistaking charged us again for the hotel stay. We informed them of their error and they said they would credit the card. The problem is now our card is locked and we are left only with cash. I spent an outrageous amount of time talking to both the Hotel and my bank to clear up this error. It was not the way I wanted to spend the first day of my vacation. I talked to 4-5 people at the hotel and 2-3 people at my bank before it was finally resolved. VERY AGGRAVATING. 6 HOUR ORDEAL. The other very aggravating issue was the location of the ice machine. There is only one for the entire complex. It is located in the far back corner above the parking garage. It can only be accessed by stairs unless you are lucky enough to be located on the far wing of the complex. It's mind boggling that the Marriott would have only one ice machine for a complex of this size. The Hotel is located on a very busy, fast moving street that is noisy all time of the day and night. The pool area is very nice and large with several water features. The bar is located very close and is also nice. The shower was large and had very good water pressure. The hot water was nice and hot. Only one mirror in the room. This became a major inconvenience when we tried to get ready go in the A.M and P.M. The grounds were clean and well maintained. I would not return here. Review #50:We chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced and was walking distance to the marina we were going out of for Kiteboarding lessons every day. It is about a mile north of most of the main attractions and beaches of Key West. Conveniently there are bikes available to rent on site at a good rate. The breakfast in the morning is very nice: Good selection, great environment by the pool, complementary newspaper, and amazingly friendly staff. The pool area is very nice. Free WiFi. Restaurants, drug stores, and grocery stores are within walking distance. If you are looking for the Key West experience and are on a budget this is perfect. Definitely get what you pay for! Review #51:Spent the night here in Feb 2010. The hotel was what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to find at other Fairfield Inns. Parking/check in/pool all were fine. Continental breakfast was standard. Suite for 4 people was adequate. We had a king size bed which was nice. The kids used the fold out in a separate room (with TV). Water pressure was good. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the highway from out location behind the pool. All tourist attractions in Key West are a good 10 min drive from the Fairfield. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ok with that then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine place to stay. A few days here would be good here but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down for a week, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d look for a place with more amenities. Review #52:I love the laid back feel of the Keys! I have stayed in this hotel once before and loved it. So when I decided to plan a friends get together, I thought that the Fairfield in Key West was perfect. The staff is so hospitable, and the hotel was very reasonably priced and a good location. We had a good time at the pool and the bar is great. Everything was perfect, especially the yummy breakfast...I can't wait to go back next year! Review #53:Like others have said, the room is small, but for two normal size people, it's fine. Not recommended if you are 250 pounds + and require major room just to move around. My guess is that the people who make comments about the size of the hotel rooms are carrying a few extra pounds. The bathroom was very nice, very updated. In fact, the bathroom and shower are the nicest part of the room. If you are wondering about the walk to Duval Street, it does take some time. My friend and I are pretty fast walkers and in shape, but it probably took us @ 40 minutes to get down there. Don't walk all the way down Hwy 1 to Duval. Start on Hwy 1 then take a right on Palm Avenue then follow Eaton Street. It ends on Duval where all the action is. It's a big difference in time. But even this \"angle\" was still 40 minutes. Ask the hotel staff if unclear. Review #54:Being a Platinum Rewards member gets you 200 points at checkin, and that is it. We just came from Doral to visit for a few days in Key West, the other Marriotts here were sold out... courtyard and beachside. The reviews from earlier on the location and staff had me optimistic that there might be bright lights. Yes, the staff are welcoming. No upgrades here due to high occupancy in winter. Basic rooms, no frills. Bring your own soaps n shampoo is you are expecting high end products. This is not the Napa Fairfield if you have ben there, you know what I mean. No no, this is much more basic. We paid $187/night, free parking, free wifi, second floor in building with no elevators, view of pool king bed and pull out sofa. No patio. Free breakfast, Marriott inn usual. Sink could use renovation. Glass shower with tile. Atleast tv was flat panel. Sofa needs to be thrown out. Mattress needs to be replaced. It is a basic fairfield inn. The price is standard for winter in Key west. There is laundry and bike rentals on site. The staff here try their best to do what thy can with what there is. If you need perks and newer accomodations, this is not it. It is the Keys, go have a drink and relax. Review #55:We really liked this hotel, nice swimming-pool area, very nice staff !! The only complain it's the noise of the street (Rosevelt Blvd), very noisy at night ! but anyway not a fault from the hotel. Free parking, no hidden extra charge, they gave us a second cocktail for free at the swimming-pool bar. The breakfast was simple but quality was there, you can make yourself some waffles. Review #56:I am lifetime platinum with Marriott and booked my room on reward points. The hotel has a lot going for it. Great staff....one of the friendliest and most helpful anywhere. There's also a large, clean, pool situated in very inviting surroundings. Another plus is an above-average complimentary breakfast buffet served poolside. In the afternoon, the breakfast area adjoining turns into a fun and friendly Tiki Bar....also very nice. Location is about a 5-10 minute drive from Duval Street shopping, dining, and nightlife. (Cabs are fairly plentiful and relatively cheap), The only problem here during my stay was the room. Clean, bright, and equipped with comfy bedding, but very small. We had three people (me, wife, and young adult son), and we kept bumping into each other. Very little storage space for luggage, etc. I did notice that they had what appeared to be larger rooms and suites. So my advice would be to book one of those (and expect to pay a little more), unless you're traveling solo, not planning spending time in the room (this IS Key West), or otherwise don't mind having limited space. Review #57:This place has clean, well maintained small rooms and a fabulous pool. They have a decent free breakfast each morning too. Unless you like a good 40 minute walk downtown you probably want to drive or get a cab to Duval or the marina. We did the walk and it wasn't bad at all; even in the heat. This is a solid choice and I would definitely go back again. Nothing fancy, but clean, and a great pool. What else do you need in Key West? Review #58:I must say, almost as great as the comforts of your own home. Being that this was my first time to The Keys, I thought I would be disappointed not being right there in the center of all the action on Duval Street. Wow, I'm glad I wasn't in the middle of the action. If I choose to go back to The Keys, Fairfield Inn would be my choice of hotel. Review #59:If you book rooms at name brand hotels because you don't want surprises when you arrive, look somewhere else. Although the main building appears to be relatively new construction - as you might expect if you've stayed in Fairfield Inns in the past - most of the rooms here are in much older buildings that had obviously been built long before Marriott took over. Although the room was clean, it was extremely small and not very well appointed. The pool area was nice but the parking area (most of it under the guest rooms on the exposed first floor) filled up quickly. Everything had a new coat of paint, but the place just had a tired, run-down feel to it. I will say, the staff were wonderful and because of them I have to give the hotel an overall \"Average\" rating. If this hotel was on a small Caribbean island it would be a gem, but in Key West I think I could have done better. Review #60:This hotel had one handicap parking spot out front, and only one entrance with a ramp to the rooms/pool area. To make someone in a wheelchair go from one end of the resort to another in order to reach a ramp is just not acceptable these days. I paid $60 more at this hotel than my hotel on Duval Street which offered an amazing cooked to order breakfast and great accessibility. The breakfast was far from good at Fairfield, and the workers were annoying trying to sell excurisions. I will definitely plan in advance to not have to stay with Fairfield again. Review #61:We chose this location because we were trying to stay out of the excitement, as we had our kids with us. The hotel is about two miles from Duval Street and the sunset at Mallory Square, which is a very easy ride. The facility was very nice, especially as compared to other Fairfield Inns. The pool was beautiful, with nice fountains and a great outdoor bar, and the bartender Mike was a super guy. The lobby was very classy, and the free breakfast offered more choices than most similar places. The rooms looked fresh and were clean. We actually used Marriott points for this one - so the room was free, and I'm not sure what the price would have been. We did not do it, but I would have felt safe leaving the kids in the room and hitting the town for a few hours at night time. Review #62:warm welcome;great poolside bar, great pool;nice room, clean everything; nice free breakfst buffett poolside; and the bonus not expected? They have Moped rental at the activity desk, and Mopeds on hand and ready to go. We got 2 and they were nice, new, and pretty reasonable. Review #63:VERY SMALL room: not up to marriott standards. Had to cahnge rooms because the ceiling was falling down, hair in the towels, and a large wad of hair in the room hair dryer. The shower had mol d spots in the ceiling and the shower tile was so slippery that it was a hazard to take a shower, must have used VERY unskilled labor as the sharp corners of the tile proturded in the shower and tile that was away from the wall and no grouted was full of gunk. Extremely disappointed in the room, although the help was very nice as was the outdoor area. Review #64:This hotel was not far from downtown and activities - about two km from Duval Street. Pool and room were beautiful. The bed was very comfortable. Continental breakfast was very good. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was next to US, which made it quite noisy at times. I would definitely stay at the Fairfield again and recommend it as well. Review #65:My boyfriend and I chose to stay here for his brothers wedding this past weekend. The main reason is because we got a free night with points. We stayed four nights in a king room. It was nice but we were a little disappointed because the room was a lot smaller than we thought it was going to be. I recommend upgrading to the king suite to give yourself more room. The shower was really nice and the room was clean. The bed was comfortable also. We also very much enjoyed the pool. Big, clean, and cheap drinks from the tiki bar. The major downside was that it was so loud every morning and hard to sleep in. We heard the same noises every morning. Housekeeping going up and down the hallway and banging around and the roosters around constantly crowing. The AC in our room was very loud as well. I'm not sure if I would stay here again but would recommend it if noises don't bother you. Review #66:Great hotel, great location, nice and quite. Our room was small but even with that, the room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel pool was very nice - I don't think I have ever seen a Fairfield Inn with a pool that large and fancy. The free breakfast was excellent and a great bargin. Also, the staff was outstanding... very friendly and helpful with everything (from check-in to local sights). We would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend this hotel. Review #67:we stayed at this hotel Nov 4-6th and had no problems. From the time I walked into the Lobby (greeted with a cup of juice) to the time of checkout the staff was friendly, helpful and always smiling. The continental breakfasts here were wonderful. Huge variety of choices and fresh selections. Pool area was great for our family (traveling with 5 year old and 2 year old). Room was huge but it was big enough and very clean and comfortable. We had a room away from the street so I can't complain about noise. Honestly for the money this was a fantastic hotel and would definitely recommend and choose it again in the future. If you are looking to be on Duval street you need to drive or taxi cab. However, we had children so it wasn't our top priority to stay out late and be in the heart of the action. Review #68:We usually do not like to stay any hotel having doors opened to outside. We did not realize it until we got over there. But we decided to give it a try. The staff was very nice, and updated our room to 2-room suite for free. Free Internet and free breakfast were also available. The tour bus stops in front of the hotel, and you may ask the receptionist for more information. She also helped us to book tickets to Dry Tortugas National park. The pool is a very beautiful one. Review #69:far from duval street and no free shuttle despite the marriot courtyard up the road providing one. pool is nice and breakfaast assortment was better than anticipated. i suspect we were in the older part of the hotel with a double room. it was clean but window opened to walkway so no privacy and room was tiny, no desk etc. we were originally going to stay 2 nights but at $359/night, no way. we were abe to get a special rate at the casa marina resort for $379/night with a $100 credit for resort acgtivities etc and it included a complete breakfast buffet. Maybe a studio suite at this hotel could barey justify their price but certainly not a room on par with a Days Inn Review #70:This hotel served a wonderful free hot and cold breakfast. Plenty of free parking, some covered. The pool is HUGE! The regular room was so small that our family of 4 could barely walk around. The regular room did NOT have micro or fridge. The beds were FULL, not queen, and there was barely room for the 2 beds. We are platinum elite with Marriott so we asked to be upgraded to a suite as soon as possible and 2 days later we got a suite for no charge. The suites were 2 room; large and spacious. A spacious living with a sleeper couch, fridge, microwave, table, 2 chairs, business desk, and desk chair. In addition there was a lounge chair and a coffee table. The TV was flat panel. There could have been more channels. In the bedroom, the beds were clean and comfortable but a little soft for my back. The bath was very small with a modern tiled shower- no tub. The bedroom is separated from the living by a glass, curtained, locking door. The windows did not open and did not have curtains. They did have nice shutters. Review #71:The hotel isn't located in the 'main strip' BUT it is within easy walking distance - a nice leisurely (and safe) walk (or if you're not inclined then a cheap taxi ride). The staff are great, even assisting in booking our day trip to Dry Tortugas (Fort Jefferson); a MUST do. Review #72:Room was clean, liked the separation of toilet/glass shower and the sink. Thank you! Breakfast was a pleasant surprise with lots of options. Pool area was nice with well-kept landscaping. Rent a bike (I recommend Eaton closer to downtown - they have lights) and enjoy the ride into town - cheaper than taxi's in the end and not too long of a ride. Be sure to have a light on your bike since it's illegal not to after dark. Review #73:Management and staff were very pleasant and helpful. However, the building is old, rooms are small and dark, A/C is too loud to keep on at night, walls are thin, walkways run along outside all the rooms hence much pedestrian noise, hotel is situated very close to highway US1 and thus noisy, room towels should have been replaced many years ago!!!! I would not stay here again. Review #74:Jimmy Buffett might have stayed here, and he would have easily found that lost shaker of salt in these very small (RV sized) rooms! So small that you could easily pole vault from the beds to the bath and back in a single attempt (I did not attempt it) The room had plantation shutters and no drapes so we enjoyed ambient LED lighting from outside all night. In the finest highway gas station rest room tradition the sink had neglected to have a drain stopper, a bow to water conservation or whatever, The toilet had an interesting sign on the lid proudly proclaiming its inefficiency with high contents. All this for ONLY $279 per night!. Staff were great, however. Breakfast good as well. Think small, stay here! Review #75:Great service, very nice rooms, (outdoor entrance to rooms) beautiful & very large pool surrounded by palm trees & shrubs so it's somewhat secluded from view. Very nice breakfast next to the pool. Only down side is it's located on a very busy/noisy highway ( the main highway in & out of Key West) & is about 2 miles from downtown Key West. I think almost all of the rooms are set back off the highway far enough to keep the noise to a minimum & also the rooms have a continuos fan option on the air conditoning system to muffle any highway noise. A good choice would be a room set back as far as possible from the highway but still overlooking the pool. The Old Town Trolley is the way to go to get downtown. They stop every half-hour at The Fairfield & 11 other stops on the island between 9am & 4:30 pm. It costs about $29.00. (It was good for 2 days which may have been a special being offered while I was there.) You'll need to take a cab back to the hotel after trolley is done for the day (about $11.00) There is a grocery store & shopping center within walking distance. Overall a great hotel to stay at if you don't mind being 2 miles from downtown. Review #76:I've stayed at the Fairfield previously and booked this trip for a retirement celebration with a family member. The staff made us feel like we were staying in a private home. They could not have been friendlier. Many staff members are from other countries but speak beauftiful english and told us charming stories of their countries. It was quite interesting. They told us they appreciated us speaking to them because it helped them learn about our country as well. Our car stayed parked at the Inn and we took local transportation to downtown Key West so we didn't have the hassle and worry of parking our car or driving in \"season\" traffic. The best way to travel. We could have rented bikes, but we took buses and taxis - cheap! GO! You'll love every minute! Review #77:Don't understand rationale for Fairfield Inn custom of NOT placing water cups in the same room as the water tap! One arrives at room thirsty, finds a water tap in the bathroom but then finds that he/she needs to try to cup hands together to have a simple drink of water! Frustrated, the still thirsty traveler now starts a 'where are the cups\" hunt? Is there some logical reason why water cups should not be placed in the same room as the water source? Also puzzled at Fairfield's practice of NOT putting water cups in the same room as the water tap? The thirsty traveler arrives at the hotel, finds the water tap in the bathroom. but no cups!? The immediate alternative is to cup hands to drink! Or leave the bathroom and embark on a cup search elsewhere in the apartment! I am at a loss to guess the reason for thus incovenient strategy ?? ? Review #78:While in Key West we prefer to stay at B&Bs near downtown, the Fairfield Inn & Suites is an acceptable alternative despite being more than two miles from Duval Street. My wife and I stayed there for three nights smack during high-priced, high-tourist season. The cost, however, was reasonable given the season. While Fairfields are in many respects average hotels, what sets this one apart is the knowledgeable, friendly staff. For instance, their recommendations of restaurants and attractions were terrific. They were most accommodating in every respect. In fact, they sought out their guests to be sure they were comfortable and had everything they needed. Our room was small but clean and stocked with all the amenities we would need. The AC was noisy when it came on. The pool area was of a quality one would expect at a four-star hotel. The outside bar and adjacent continental breakfast area spacious. All in all, if we couldn't be closer to the action downtown, the Fairfield did nicely. Review #79:We drove in looking for a room with no reservation on christmas eve.a lil pricier then I wanted but was worth it! Great pool and tiki bar.excellent continental breakfast.staff was accommodating and patient with my kids.doesn't look like anything from the front but a great place to stay.it is away from the square though.but was still worth it! Review #80:first of all. hotel prices are high in Key West in general. You can compare it to New York. The location of this hotel is next to the main road and that causes a considerable amount of noise. Staff was generally friendly despite the fact that the manager started an argument with us in the lobby. for our part the whole thing with giving out discount coupons for places to drink (buy one drink, get one for free) reminded us of party-charter-tourism to Ibiza, and takes away the exotic experinence of going to Key West. It underlined that if you want to see something enjoyable in Key West you better be drunk, which is not the fact at all. Key West is a place to visit no doubt. Lots of stuff to do, and plenty of amazing restaurants offering high class seafood. The restaurant neither had a lactose nor a gluten free selection of food, and the breakfast reminded me of prior experiences at Holiday Express or Days Inn. There are plenty of hotels in Key West. This one would definitely not be my 1st choice for my next stay. Review #81:Small rooms with extremely comfortable beds. Plenty of towels and the room was clean. Good free breakfast with plenty of selections. Free parking in the hotel yard. I can recommend staying here but remember it is pretty far from all the action in central Key West. You will need a car to go to the bach and downtown or take a taxiwherever you go. Not so many things within walking distance except for some shops and restaurants (like Friday\u00c2\u00b4s). One thing I did not like; We stayed on the 2nd floor. The railings had a note attached \"Please do not lean on railing\" and I felt like the railing could fall down any minute! This made me feel a bit unsafe when walking there with my 2 year old daughter. However I still feel I can recommed this hotel, staff was helpful and rooms comfortable. Review #82:Friendly, helpful staff and nice clean rooms that include amenities like walk-in showers & mini-fridges plus the bed was extra comfy. Had a room that faced US 1 and it was a bit noisy, but not to the point of annoyance and it did not disturb our sleep. Lack of elevator in our wing made lugging the suitcases up and down the stairs a chore. This was only an inconvenience not worth getting upset over as the staff was more than willing to help. Breakfast included in the room and it was the typical \"Continental\" fare served in most hotels in the Fairfield class. The hotel's General Manager was on hand to greet guests and make sure they were taken well care of which was a nice touch. All-in-all, a very good value compared to the closer-in but much pricier alternatives. I would stay again. Review #83:My husband and I stayed here for 5 days while vacationing in Key West. The room was really clean and well stocked. The pool is absolutely amazing, almost like you were staying at a resort. There were only two things I would change. The first thing is I would have loved a hot tub. The second thing, which was not the fault of the hotel, were the random roosters that wandered outside, making all kinds of noises in the early morning hours. However, the beautiful tiling and awesome bathroom made up for those two things! We will definitely stay here again! Review #84:Despite reading other reviews stating that the rooms were very small, we booked a suite for our 3 day stay in Key West. The property is off the beaten track and easily located. Our first impression was that we were not going to enjoy the Fairfield Inn. However, the building where you checkin was very nice and the desk clerks very helpful. The pool was very nice and the lobby inviting, so we figured that we would be OK. We were assigned a suite on the first floor. However, the first floor requires stairs/elevator--not good for persons with physical impairments. The Fairfield Inn has exterior corridors, which presents safety issues. Upon entering the unit, we were shocked at the cavelike atmosphere. Not only was the \"suite\" extremely small, but with very low ceilings and little light, it had a claustrophobic feeling. The bedroom was decent sized, with tile floors and a king bed. The bathroom was huge--especially considering how small the room was. The pie shaped \" living room\" had a sleeper sofa and built in refrig/microwave. The problem with this arrangement is safety. Not only is the sleeper sofa near the entrance, but right above it is a window on the exterior corridor, making it easy for child snatching . Also of concern is a fire issue---with the sleeper sofa opened, there is no way to walk around it in the event of a fire. Because of the safety issues, we checked out of the Fairfiled Inn . The desk clerk, Kelly, was very understanding and gracious and offered to move us. But because all of the rooms had exterior entrances, we chose to decline her offer. Review #85:For my first trip to Key West we decided to stay at the Fairfield Inn and Suites - I was extremely disappointed in the rooms. I thought that they were exceptionally small. Our room was located near the elevator and we were kept awake most of the first night of our stay by everyone returning from the bar in the middle of the night. The next day we did relocate to a room along the back of the hotel - so our view was only of the parking lot but at least it was quiet. Pool area was great as was the breakfast but by Marriott standards - this was certaintly not a category 5 hotel. My next trip back to Key West in April was definitely not spent at the Fairfield. Review #86:The Fairfield is a smart and well run hotel on the outskirts of Key West. It's easy to find on the main ring road into the City, but a little awkward due to there being a limited bus service and around 1.5miles from the main City centre. The Key West trolley tour makes a stop outside every 30min though, which is good if you're not into walking. Staff are very courteous and professional. Checking in and out a breeze. The lobby has free coffee (certain times only) and free internet. Free parking is also available to the rear of the hotel. Rooms are well appointed with large comfortable beds and a 'nautical' themed decor (to match the area you're staying in I guess!!). Air con was somewhat noisy and intrusive in both of our rooms, but worked well. The free breakfasts were ample and in a pleasant outdoor environment, and the pool deserves a mention as it's one of the best. All in all a pleasant hotel, a tad expensive and remote for the City, but fine for us. Review #87:The front desk people were very helpful and friendly. I liked that our room had a tile floor and not carpeting. The bed was very comfortable and even though we brought our own pillows, we didn't need them because the pillows they had were fine. We also had extra towels and got bigger towels for the pool. Breakfast was more than adequate and the pool area was very enjoyable. We were only sorry that the pool didn't have a hot tub too. Review #88:Our stay at the Fairfield was very pleasant. The front desk staff was very helpful and greeted us with sample strawberry daiquiris upon arrival. We were also given a handful of coupons for buy one get one free deals at local clubs and restaurants (mostly for drinks). They also gave us multiple phone numbers for taxi services and the bus schedule. The bus picks up right near the hotel. We were equipped with a map of Key West and the man at the desk was very kind to explain all of the different areas. The hotel also has a list of restaurant recommendations, which are staff favorites. Unfortunately the bus doesn't travel too late. We stayed in a two room suite that was very clean. The living room area was a tad small and the layout awkward, but it was alright. The master suite was very large with a huge comfortable bed with clean white sheets. The bathroom was also very clean. The continental breakfast was average - waffles, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, fruit, juice, hard boiled eggs, cereals are some of the items I remember. The pool area was very nice. The chairs were arranged to make you feel like you were at a private pool. There was a tiki bar (only open until 7 PM); the bartender wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too friendly. The Duval street is not far from the hotel, only a couple of minutes by car. I would not walk. There is also a many franchise restaurants and grocery stores nearby. We only paid $130 a night, so our room was a bargain! Review #89:Our stay at the Fairfield Inn in Key West was a very pleasant one. All of the attendants were so friendly and helpful. It was unfortunate that our stay could not have been longer, maybe next time and I certainly would consider staying at the Fairfield again. Thank you, Cheryl Hille Review #90:looking on the map this looks like a nice out of the way location. Wrong. It would seem that the road running along the front of the hotel is one of the main roads into Key West. First room seemed was not a suite as described when I booked it and you could put your fingers into the gap around the front door. There was so much road noise that there might as well have not been a front door. We immediately went back to reception and complained. We had to wait 15 mins but were then given a room on the first floor with a front door that did keep the noise out but was still traffic facing (maybe they keep the better rooms for families staying for more than 1 night).Tthe room was very nice and in a good state of repair. If you call a larger room with a double bed and a sofa bed a suite then you will not be disappointed. I do not so I was. The buffet breakfast was ok for free as long as you do not have high expectations and you don't mind sitting in an open covered area with only fans and no a/c (not so good as it was 89 degrees at 0800). You do sit along side a lovely pool though, one of the better features of this hotel. Also the free plentiful parking (some even under cover) is also one of the better features of the hotel. My suggestion, ask for a room at the back of the hotel and things will be fine. Review #91:When I called Fairfield Inn I was told the hotel was situated at the beach but in fact it was a mile away - very disappointing. Had I known that in advance I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have booked it. My second disappointment was the poor breakfast selection. Third - no gift shop. Fourth - unpleasant bike/scooter rental service. And finally, some of the stuff members were overly attentive. I would stay there again. Review #92:Overall really good hotel, good location, nice rooms even though they were missing some amenities in the rooms (no fridge for example). Even though I rarely use the pool when on vacation because I prefer touring the touristic locations, I have to say the pool area was very charming. You can take your breakfast by the pool which is surrounded by a lush tropical garden, making your experience very enjoyable. Staff was friendly, rooms were clean. The only negative might be the location. While it is nicely located in Key West (easy access - plus the island is small of course :), it is not by the beach if this is what you are looking for. Review #93:As I write this review, I am currently in a room in the hotel. Too much road noise and the loud AC have kept me awake so far. 1st impression was not good - even my 6 year old commented that the hotel looked like a red roof inn. 1st room got flooded - was shifted to another room. I am not impressed with this hotel at all. For the money that I paid (160$), I have stayed in far better marriotts in the past. My outlook of marriott has now changed and I will need to be very careful when I select a marriott in the future. I hope that the Sales Manager reads this review and offers me a nice complimentary something to make up for my stay. Review #94:I visit Key West once a month. I have stayed in a number of places on the island. This is the best value I have found. The rooms are nice. The location is close enough to the fun spots, yet far enough away that you can actually park your car at your own hotel. (For free and under cover) The staff has always been energetically friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. To keep it fair; the rooms are not brand new but they are clean and in good repair. The one thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like different is a restaurant within walking distance. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at those places and they are not as good a hotel. Review #95:I can't say enough about the staff at the Fairfield. The best customer service I've had in a long time! They were very helpful recommending restaurants and activities. They also have THE BEST POOL AND BAR, which is top priority for me, considering the poor beaches @KW. We rented a scooter right on the property, which is KEY! ONLY complaint...rooms could use a little update;) Review #96:I booked this 4 night February stay on Priceline and was awarded this hotel. I was happy to get it from previous reviews and they didnt disappoint. They are in a decent location with grocery and other stores nearby with a 5min bike ride to Duval street. Our room was a bit small but was spotless. The pool area and tiki bar while not spectacular did the job very well. The free Wifi at the hotel worked flawlessly. A big plus was the free parking and large selection for continental breakfast. The breakfast area had your basic fruits,cereals,Jimmy Dean breakfast items,juices/coffee,yogurts,waffles,USA Today newspaper and other items. There is a moped and bike rental kiosk onsite also. The from desk staff and other staff may have been the best Ive ever encountered. Kudos to Mirella(sp) I was hoping for the Casa Marina,Reach,Hyatt or Westin when I was bidding on Priceline. They didnt work out and I was given this gem. Thanks for a great stay. Review #97:We stayed in one of their suites and while the master bedroom was large, the second room with the pullout couch was not. Service was courteous and \"happy\". However, we had to call three times and deal with multiple visits from the staff before we received sheets and a bed cover for the pullout bed. The room windows are not darkened in any way. Lots of sunlight comes into it. Not good. Finally, the walls are paper thin, we could hear our next door neighbors and because all rooms face an outdoor walkway we would hear everyone that walked by. Review #98:My husband and I stayed here in June 2011 on a vacation trip to Key West- and found we made an excellent choice from among the many options available! The entire hotel is very clean and neat and our room (a King studio) was lovely, nicely decorated, and bright. The bed was comfortable and the private balcony overlooking the pool a nice plus. Bathroom was more spacious than most hotels of this type, and tile floors throughout the room were a welcome change from difficult to keep clean carpeting we've encountered at other places. Service from the staff was truly outstanding and always friendly! Everyone we encountered went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and to offer suggestions on how to best enjoy Key West! The pool is lovely (actually as nice as pictured on the hotel website!) with lots of seating available and features a poolside tiki hut that serves a daily reasonably priced drink special along with its regular full bar menu. A poolside limited buffet breakfast was included each morning; food was fresh and menu included a couple of non-standard items along with the typical cereal, fruit, and make-it-yourself waffles. The hotel is located about 2 miles from the \"downtown action\"- but the ease of free parking onsite and sight-seeing trolley that stops there frequently make up for that small inconvenience. This is an entirely nonsmoking hotel- something my husband and I especially appreciated! One drawback for some might be the lack of elevator to the second floor rooms in some areas of the hotel. Although there is no restaurant onsite there are numerous restaurants in the area from which to choose. Review #99:When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted with refreshments and big smiles from the staff. Throughout our visit, the staff was very attentive and very friendly. Breakfast bar was fantastic. The drive from the hotel to Mallory Square and Duval Street was about 5-7 minutes. Bicycle and/or scooter rental was available from the hotel. Rooms were nice and clean. Had a problem with the air conditioner, but service technician was there to correct problem within 5 minutes of calling the front desk. Couldn't ask for any better service.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

We stay here often, several times a year, and once again had a fabulous experience. The hotel is so conveniently located, rooms are spacious and clean with fabulous views of the beach, great lobby area and coffee shop. The hotel staff is extremely friendly from the moment you call to make a reservation, during your stay, until the time you check out. The entire staff is always great to deal with, however, during this particular visit, Fay at the front desk went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. She was extremely friendly and accommodating. It was so nice to meet someone who really enjoys their job and does it well!!! When we checked out, Fay had a birthday card from the hotel and a piece of cake for my husband. Her kindness and thoughtfulness speaks volumes for the type of service you'll receive. The Grand is fortunate to have an employee as fantastic as she! You will enjoy staying here - and if you're lucky, Fay will greet you when you arrive. Review #1:The Grand Hotel has always been my favorite hotel in Ocean City. It's right on the boardwalk and near everything. I went in November alone and still had a great time. (Me Time). The spa is right in the hotel and the massage I had was just what the doctor order. You really didn't have to venture out if you didn't want to. Everything you need is in the hotel. (Spa. restaurant, lounge, indoor pool & game room along with an excerise room.) You even can do minor shopping without going outside. The rooms and views are great! Review #2:This place was great! My husband and I stayed here at the end of September on a mid-week madness special. It was worth the drive! Our room had a great view, we got a dinner coupon worth $60. The coffee shop was open all night, which was perfect for us night owls. The girls at the front desk were so much fun. They let us know about all the spots locals go to have fun. We can not wait to come back!!! ! Review #3:This was our second trip to OC. It is a very expensive destination in comparison to Virginia Beach or Myrtle Beach, but we wanted to give it a second try. We travel extensively and I always research hotels prior to making my decision. Because I felt that I had \"did my homework\" before choosing our hotel, I really want to share our experience. Upon check-in, the level of customer service was poor. Only 1 of 3 agents understood English and their computer system. This made for an extremely long line at 3:00. Our room was very average. It was a decent size, however the bathroom was extremely small. The door had no hooks on the back so there was no place to put your clothes. The mini-kitchen in the room was very handy; although this is standard in most beach hotel rooms. The balcony came with two chairs BUT no table. Very inconvenient. Our room was cleaned very late in the day every day but once, I had to call for housecleaning because at 5:30 they still have not come. Pros of the facility: Common areas very clean Location on boardwalk; ample parking Cons of the facility: Poor customer service No tables in pool area or on balconies Disgusting indoor pool On our third night there, the fire alarm went off at 2am and again at 7am. Is this the fault of their system, or of a stupid individual. Who knows? BUT it sure was annoying. Would we return again to OC? Definately not. The boardwalk games and rides were extremely expensive. You definately get \"more for your buck\" at VA Beach or Myrtle. If we were to return, my #1 choice for accommodations would be The Breaker's Hotel. We went and looked at that hotel and the staff was most pleasant and the rooms were really nice. Good luck in your vacation planning! ! Review #4:My boyfriend and I stayed at The Grand Hotel, OC MD from 08/19/2011 to 08/22/2011. This hotel, although some reviews were unfavorable, was wonderful! The view from our 6th floor room was of both the ocean and the bayside. Beautiful! The staff was friendly, the room was clean and the ammenities left nothing to be desired. Both indoor and outdoor pool, game room, spa, and the beach was steps away! You could access every store and restaurant from the inside of the hotel so the one night it rained for a while was no problem. Our balcony was large and morning coffee, listening to the waves was very relaxing. Being right on the boardwalk in OC made our stay perfect. The lobby was large- no crowds to be avoided. For those who have had complaints, I think that you should consider the value of a place that puts you in the heart of everything and offers a great nights rest in rooms that are comfortable and clean. We walked around and looked at other hotels to see up close what we had seen online....we were glad we chose the Grand Hotel. No loud parties and very family friendly if traveling with kids. We will definately stay at The Grand again and hope to return with family next year. Thanks to everyone at The Grand for a weekend getaway worthwhile! Review #5:We stayed for Memorial Weekend and we must say that we arrived early in the morning and we got our bedroom without a problem. The Room is big with Ocean View and a balcony. It was Clean OK as it was the Bathroom. We had a bikers and a church convention so the crowd was interesting for say the least at least visually. Must say that every one was respectful and we did not have any complains. The noise at night was loud, but then again it was Memorial Weekend so we were expecting it. At Check Out we had a Complimentary hour and a half so our check out was at 12:30 instead of 11:00 am. The staff told us that we could use the 2ND floor restrooms and locker to change if needed. So, we did, it was useful not extremely clean but in good shape and super useful. As mentioned before mixed feelings. The hotel was not that bad, it is outdated but then again Ocean City seems out dated as a whole! Staff was willing to accommodate and the rooms were OK. Review #6:Wish we can find a Quiet boardwalk hotel w/the pool bar luxuries & an indoor pool for emergencies. Been here 4 times due to the price (7th, 2nd, 3rd, 6th floors, least expensive room). Had a good view on the 7th floor at the end, better than the 2nd floor w/the railing blocking the view for picture taking. A bit noisy outdoors & the A/C noise was inconsistent (only hummed when it needed to reach thermostat temp). Screen door needed oiling/unrusting. Staff was professional. Apologized when they were talking too loudly at the service elevator. Honored the \"please clean\" sign promptly. Bed & toiletries made beautifully. At the swimming pool, staff put on the lounge coverup & gave a strong towel. Nice to have a tropical drink on the lounge chair:) Boardwalk location had a bit of room so it wasn't exactly right next to the boardwalk. Review #7:Me and my wife were checked in on sat of Sep 24 2011.As Soon as I try to check in, they didnt even had my reservation untill I show my paper comfirmation. Front desk guest service were horrible, well They don\u2019t even say word \u201csorry\u201d! it\u2019s not that hard to say it word sorry Also, AC sound like having a big problem~ B/c I thought it was airplane engine was turned on, I could't even sleep well...personally, it was my first time staying in OC with Grand hotel, but it will be my last time...BTW... I will say one good thing is Ocean View... Review #8:They advertise in-room WiFi but I could only use my laptop in the lobby. When I called the desk they said they would look into it. That was two days ago. Restaurants and lounge aren't open and there is NO satisfactory food on site. Spa was never open as advertised. I know it's off-season, but there are lots of people here. Staff also sneak into the closed jewelry store and out of the way hallways to smoke. Very unpleasant. The view is beautiful, but that's not worth the complete absence of amenities. House-keeping is the only group that was consistently competent and professional. Next time, I'm heading down the way to Marriott. My rate was very, very low...got what I paid for. Review #9:Just wanted to say Thank you to The Grand and Christina at the front desk. We booked at another hotel and it was awful but when we went to the Grand we were able to save our week vacation. Christina at the front desk was so helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back. The room was nice, clean and spacious. The view was beautiful it was great to see the bay and the ocean. Thanks again. Review #10:I've been reading a lot of reviews on this site, that said the Grand Hotel was horrible, and to steer clear of it, but I've been staying there for six years, and never once had a problem with it. The rooms are nice, the hotel seems clean and the staff is friendly. There are two pools, which is good since neither pool is ever too crowded. I will admit the rooms are a bit dark (nothing that can't be fixed with a flip of a few switches), and the balcony isn't too private, however, it's a great location and the balcony has ample room to sit any sandy beach toys. The absolute best thing about the Grand is the parking garage, which has quite a lot of space, and is perfect, since finding parking in Ocean City, without having to walk a few blocks and crossing the busy highway isn't exactly easy. Sure, the Grand isn't anything overly special, but it's a great hotel for its price. I definitely recommend. Review #11:My family of 4 stayed at grand at was disappointed with the service of employees. Compared to previous years of staying at the hotel the staff does not speak english nor understand very well. Lazy staff and incompetent. This is my last stay here at the grand I will go to another hotel. I would pass on this hotel if you are thinking about staying here because other hotels offer better amenties than this one for the price Review #12:Just got home from staying at the Grand Hotel in O.C. and can't wait to go back! The staff from front desk to maids to pool attendants to GM-Patrick were awesome. The rooms are very spacious and the kitchenette was perfect. The view from the room was beautiful even though we didn't have a \"direct view\" room. We lost our car keys on the second day there and General Manager Patrick went above and beyond to get us a replacement key from a dealership 30 minutes away. I highly recommend staying here and if I could I would give them 6 stars! Review #13:Our recent stay at The Grand Hotel in Ocean City, MD was good but not exceptional. The big plus was that the room was ocean front. In fact, all of the rooms are ocean front so if this is something that it important to you, than this is the place. The price was definitely reasonable for an ocean front stay. However, the ad on their website did promise free Wi-Fi and that was pretty much non existent unless of course you wanted to spend your time in the lobby. The rooms were decent but it would have been nice if they had at the very least a larger refrigerator. The food choice at the Terrace Restaurant was breakfast only and it was only an option Thurs-Sun which was a bit strange. The lounge, pool bar and exercise room were fairly nice and easily accessible. The front desk staff were rather uninformed which wasn't helpful when spending a vacation in a tourist city. Overall, the experience at The Grand was good but when we go back next time, I think we'll give another hotel a try. Review #14:This was a great hotel. Located on the boardwalk, oceanfront was wonderfull. Room was very clean. This is the second time we stayed this summer. Room was very large. Nice size balcony. Little kitchenette had plenty of cabinet space & countertop. Bathroom, beds & carpet was very clean. This end of the boardwalk was very quite & away from the crowd. You leave the hotel & walk across the boardwalk & right down to the beach. Very convenient. We plan to go back in September which will make it the third time this summer. So it must be a very nice place to stay because we would not keep coming back if it wasn't. The only thing that wasn't that great was the breakfast in the restaurant. Will eat somewhere else next time. The bar had great pina collattas. Review #15:This hotel has a great location and the way its shaped we got a room with views of both ocean and bayside. There is a cute tiki bar at the pool, but they don't offer pool side service which would make it better. They have alot of amenties in this hotel including a pizza place which is open until midnight and a 24hr cafe. We would def recommend this hotel to others and would come back again! Review #16:Pros: Room looks like online photo\u2026pleasant surprise, met expectations Room is spacious\u2026comfortably housed two adults, a teen and a pre-teen Management was responsive to wi-fi issues Housekeeping was very responsive to requests for additional towels and washcloths No problem finding a parking space in garage Great location (far enough away from the main section of the boardwalk, but close enough) Side view room still gave great view of the beach / ocean Easy beachfront access Overall, a comfortable environment Cons: Sliding door to balcony an issue \u2013 way too heavy that my 11 year old could not slide it open (addressed here by management; apparently these are being replaced). General housekeeping was just okay \u2013 in and out of the room in no time flat Only two plastic chairs on balcony \u2013 not comfortable for enjoying the beautiful ocean view (even from our side room) or people-watching Charge for room safe (What\u2019s next? Charging for use of the TV or toilet?) Would I return to the Grand Hotel? Most likely! And note to Management: if my car key / remote is found, please let me know (details left with front desk). Thanks! Review #17:We have stayed at the Grand Hotel for 6 years in a row. We love the ocean view. The place is clean and the rooms are very nice and big. The location is great because it is close to all the things my family likes to do at the beach. Phillips restaurant is only a half block away. Right across the street is a new Dairy Queen and Candy Kitchen. Miniature golf is only about a block away. And our favorite breakfast place, Happy Jacks, is only about 2 blocks away. We did notice this year that it is getting time for remodeling. A hotel of this type asking around $300 a night should try to stay fresh and new. (Hopefully the owners and managers read these reviews.) The furnishing are starting to look dated. They need to upgrade to flat screen TVs. The furniture, since it is laminate and not real wood, is really starting to show wear. The bar on the sliding door was broken and missing pieces. When my husband sat in one of the green plastic chairs on the balcony, it broke. They are getting weather worn and brittle and in need of replacing. We love the Grand Hotel. We recommend it to family and friends and will return next year! Review #18:This hotel is great for someone who wants to be close to the action but not in the action . You can walk right to the beach and if it is raining there is the option of the indoor pool. The hotel has lots to offer such as a 24hr sweet eatery and there is a bar and spa. Where the hotel lacks is the actual room. The room is clean but not updated. So a little bit of a renovation is due. They room needs new curtains, carpet and the mattress was just ok...my husband did not get a good sleep but I slept ok. My 15yr old son snored loudly and slept as if he was home. The service was good. The front dest was friendly and helpful. It gets three stars for location if it was not for that it would have been two stars. More than likely this family would not return. We will ttry another hotel. Review #19:Stayed here for a family beach weekend this summer. It will be our new home for trips to OCMD. The hotel is located on the boardwalk but, unlike other hotels closer to the attractions, it's not like playing a game of Frogger to cross to the beach. It was within easy walking distance to everything we needed - restaurants, snacks, miniature golf - and a very doable walk down to the end of the boardwalk. A bonus is that it's the only round hotel so it's easy to spot when walking the beach or boards. Our room was clean and spacious with a great ocean view. There's no privacy between balconies on the lower floors so sitting outside can be awkward. The upper floors appeared to have screens to remedy that. The 2nd floor rooftop pool was fantastic with a full bar and towel service. We were there several times each day for a dip. See you next summer, Grand Hotel! Review #20:Stayed here while attending an event at the convention center. The Grand Hotel is located nicely and my room (1105) had a wonderful southern view of the boardwalk and beach. The large room with two queen beds was comfortable and quiet. The refrigerator was convenient, and the hotel staff are very responsive. I booked anextra room for my hospitality suite one night and the staff cleared out the beds and replaced the beds with rounds and chairs for my guests. Even the California Cheesteak in the pizzaria on the gound floor was of special quality. I will certainly return! Review #21:We usually go to Myrtle Beach every year and this year we thought we would try something different. What a mistake that was. When we made reservations, we asked about their entertainment and we were told that \"there is something going on here every night\". They ACTUALLY had entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights only. The restraunt was closed for 2 days for a private party. Just as well though because the doors to it were filthy with fingerprints all week long so we wouldnt have eaten there anyway. The lounges, restraunts, pool bar, pizza parlor and the shops were all owned by a third party and you could not charge food or drinks to your room. (I guess they thought people go swimming with their cash and credit cards in their pockets). I asked about smoking in the lounge and instead of saying \"I'm sorry sir but Maryland state law prohibits smoking inside\" The bartender instead said \"If you want to smoke, go outside\". There were kids skateboarding in the parking garage all day Thursday, .although there was a sign saying NO SKATEBOARDING. My concern was one of them losing control and hitting my motorcycle. We also looked for the hot tub as we thought for sure that a place that called themselves a resort would have one. We were wrong. It seemed to me as if after we checked in and they billed my charge card, that's all they cared about. For over 250.00 per night, the management team should visit Myrtle Beach resorts and learn customer relations from them. Review #22:I stayed at the Grand with my wife and two kids. Our room was extremely large and comfortable compared to most hotels in the area. We were able to thrown down a blow up mattress and still have plenty of room to move around. The ice machine was right outside my door and I never heard a peep late at night. The rooms seem to be very quite and soundproof compared to other hotels I have stayed in. We did not use the pools, but they seemed well maintained to me. The beach outside of the hotel is the best selling point - it's GRAND!!! When compared to staying in other locations in Ocean City, the beach at this location is very large and accommodates large crowds without making you feel like a sardine. The front desk staff was very friendly and helped with any issues and/or questions we had. Yes, I'll be back... Review #23:We checked in and were expecting a \"nice\" ocean view; however, our room was on the crappy 2nd floor. We could barely see the ocean due to the 1st floor shops and the restricting balcony. If you are staying, request a room 3rd floor or above. The 2nd floor's ice machine was also broken. We rode to the 12th (top) floor to get ice and everyone was complaining up there because it was so hot on the 12th floor. No free breakfast here, but you can go to the coffee shop where you will pay $5.50 for a latte or $2.75 for a cup of black coffee. Upon entering our room, there was fecal matter that was \"left behind\" from the previous guests. It was awful and disgusting, on the side of the toilet. Disappointed in the house keepers. I also would have to agree with a previous reviewer--the pillows are terrible, so bring your own or request 12 extras at check in. I had to ask 3 times for 4 extra pillows. They weren't too happy with me. Very outdated furniture and television. I guess that's why the price is so-so. I would highly recommend staying elsewhere. This was my first and last time at the Grand. Review #24:My husband and I stayed the Memorial Day Weekend and it was very pleasant. We had a wonderful view of the ocean. The room was clean and our maid service was very good. It was nice being right there on the boardwalk, didn't need your car to get anywhere. The room was very large and the bed was comfortable. The staff was very helpful and I would recommend this hotel to anyone Review #25:Every year my family goes to OC in January and again in March for the children's birthdays. We always book two rooms for my sister's family and my own. We had just checked into the Grand, with minor problems, we always request adjoining rooms and that seems to be a small problem for this hotel, but, the fire alarm and sprinkler system had gone off on our floor and to be precise in the room right next to mine and my sisters, we waited patiently while the staff was in the room where the sprinkler originally went off, the carpeting in our rooms were soaked as was some of our luggage and kids toys, etc. We waited about 1/2 hour and I finally went and asked one of the staff what to do about our rooms, they barely made eye contact as they sent me to the front desk. Once at the front desk, they acted as though it was my problem, after some convincing they gave us two new rooms, but, made no gesture to help us move our luggage or belongings, When I told the manager it would be nice to be comped an additional nights stay either during this stay or for our stay that was pending for March. They told me that they could not do that. We booked two rooms at the very least (4) times a year and they could not offer any compensation for our inconvenience. I was very very disappointed in management at that point and we have begun staying at a different resort at the Ocean. Review #26:My husband, granddaughter and I just spent a wonderful week at the Grand Hotel in Ocean City Maryland. We have been coming to Ocean City for the past 14 years for the Maryland State Fire Association Convention and I think this is the best place that we have stayed! Our room was very spacious and clean. The staff were very friendly and courteous. Our 6 year old granddaughter loved the indoor pool. We spent a lot of time at the outdoor pool which was very nice. Several of our friends who belong to our local fire department stayed at the Grand and they too were very satisfied. We will definitely be back again next year! Review #27:Just got back from our Ocean Ciy vacation today. We stayed at the Grand this year. After having a less than grand time there in 2008 (anyone who has read my tirade after our July '08 vacation knows what I'm talking about) we took a break and stayed somewhere else last year. We came back to the Grand because the location is perfect. I must say that I am glad we did!!! Check in was a breeze, we got the floor we wanted, the view was FANTASTIC (we had more of an ocean view than we ever had before). How lovley to lay in bed and see the ocean!! The hotel was clean, staff was very friendly and helpful. There MUST have been a change of management. A change for the good!!! I will be happy to again recommend The Grand! ! Review #28:I want to start out by saying the housekeeping staff was very timely and efficient. The hotel is nice, and on the quieter end of the boardwalk, but needs to finish updating rooms. Especially needs knew sliding doors, (among other improvements) that are not fogged and you can open and close without a struggle. There is a lack of communication between employees at the hotel front desk, we received different check-in information from different employees, which was a little frustrating and confusing. Also, one of the front desk managers, Nina, needs to work on her people skills. A manager can be an efficient manager or be an efficient manager with interpersonal skills. As far as achieving those skills, that would depend on how much of a priority good customer service is to that manager and to the hotel. Review #29:When my group arrived to start our golf vacation, we were thoroughly impressed. The rooms were beautiful, the staff was great, and the ammenities were spectacular. I booked this hotel since it was on the boardwalk. I never realized all that the Grand Hotel had to offer. We enjoyed the nightclub, which made it alot safer for us to enjoy a few cocktails after our rounds of golf. The 24 hour coffee shop was a delight all by itself. This is the place that we all would gather in the morning get a cup of coffee and then get on the road to our golf course destination. Iwould strongly recommend the Grand Hotel to everyone I know and any and all who ask me where to stay while in Ocean City. I am putting together another golf trip for my gang of misfits and the Grand Hotel is at the top of the list for accomodations. Review #30:My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hotel on 21st St on 3/29/2012. I had won a contest at the Grand and received a room upgrade as my gift, so when I booked the room, Matt Brown at the Grand gladly upgraded my room to direct oceanfront. I also had asked for a high floor and they again accomodated my request. When we checked in, we were greeted by Erin who was very sweet and competent, and she even called our room a short while later to see if we were satisfied and if there was anything we needed. Very few hotels do this any more, even the so called \"upscale\" hotels in OC. Our room was a 2 queen with efficiency kitchen, dining area, and bathroom. The room was very large, very clean and nicely kept up. The cabinets in the kitchen appeared to be new as well. My only issues were that the mattresses were a bit soft and had wells when we slept, and the bathroom was a bit smaller than we would have liked, but it was clean and satisfactory. The oceanfront balconies on all floors except the top three have open balconies so there is no privacy if that's important to you. I think the reason for this is to give everyone the best possible view considering that the hotel is basically a half circle. I didn't have the chance to try the spa or pools, but our stay was very nice and I would stay there again. Thank you Grand for such a nice stay. Review #31:I'm a 54 year old woman who went for a week in July with my mother as a special birthday treat for myself. The first night (Saturday) we were on the 2nd floor and the noise was horrible. Doors slamming, people yelling in nearby rooms, etc. Sunday we asked to be moved and apparently there was only one room available at \"our rate\" and we would be called when it was available. We waited all day, checking in occasionally to see if we could move and for some reason it took until my 5:30 call to get the other room. That was basically 2 days of my vacation! Then the voice mail didn't work, the iron didn't work (took two calls and several hours to get an iron!) Amenities were not left by the cleaning service so we had to track down the maid's cart several times to get shampoo, etc. I wrote to the hotel with my complaint and received no reply. I wrote to the management company and received no reply. Bottom line is I spent over $1,400 for the room, money in the restaurant, money in the salon and money in the shops. Next time I'll know better and spend my money where I am appreciated as a customer. Review #32:3 months ago, i booked my vacation with the grand. i originally wanted a regular room with direct ocean view. i later found out that one was available, but jacuzzi suits had direct ocean view. so i spent the extra money and booked that room. when i had checked in i had their first room, all the way to the right. barely any view, most of the view was there parking lot. i called front desk and they changed me over 6 rooms? why couldn't that be done earlier? .. note (this happened the previous year as well). after one night at the hotel we find out that the plumbing in the room was not working, then later found out the whole 12th floor had a problem, water had no pressure to make it to the 12th floor, water toilets would just stop. General Manager, told me they would fix it. 5 days 4 nights later same problem was happening, water would stop for up to 30 sec. He sent me a bottle of Champagne that i spit out because it was probably a $3.99 bottle. No refund, no refund/partial discount, nothing. Is this normal did i pay more for this? Not to mention the staff are all college/ foreign exchange students who barely speak the language. This will be my last time at this hotel, i have been going to ocean city for 15 yrs. now and will try the Marriot (brand new ), Hilton (expensive but worth it) or the Holiday in Suit (which is in- between the two). P.S. not to mention the complimentary FIRE ALARM EVACUATION AT 10:30 p.m., looks like another reoccurring problem the \"GRAND\" has put aside to fix. Review #33:Once again another fab weekend here !! The storm came through and was wonderful to see from the amazing view point of the 8th floor. And the next day glorious sunshine, blue skys and sea !! Just breath taking. Service was impeccable as always !! The kids had such fun at the pool !! And they were tuckered out after so weactually got some rest ;) Thanks to the Grand Family ! ! Review #34:This hotel may have once been \"grand\" but the time has passed. The rooms are large but lacking in amenities. The mattress feels old and the pillows flat. Instead of sitting at the desk to work, I had to hover by the door to my room to connect to the Internet. The balconies do not have solid dividers so you are looking into your neighbor's space and the \"furniture\" on the balconies consists of cheap plastic chairs. The view of the ocean is beautiful but, unfortunately, I couldn't see it because there was condesation trapped inside the sliding door and blocking any view out. There was even an envelope requesting a tip for the maids! I'm not sure about the value for the money issue as I was not paying for the room but the hotel left much to be desired. I have to believe there are better places to stay in OC. Review #35:I last stayed at The Grand in Aug of 2009. The last time I stayed, I booked an ocean front room. I like to look out of the balcony and people watch or listen to the waves crash at night. This time around I booked my vacation late and there weren't any ocean front rooms available. We had an ocean view room which you can still see the ocean and the boardwalk from. Everything was pretty much the same as last time. The rooms clean, the staff is friendly, the pool is a little on the smaller side but the outside pool bar is fantastic. The one issue I had was some of the other guest. On both sides of our room we had loud quest. They came in at night at very early hours, obviously drunk and rowdy. Two doors down, a guest had passed out drunk in his chair on the balcony. The ocean front rooms are only about $10 more a night and I would of gladly spent the extra money to not have to deal with that nonsense. My assumption is that a better class of people would stay at the ocean front rooms. Its not something that the hotel can really control (who stays there) and it was just a minor annoyance. Not something I would hold against the hotel itself. Its still a pretty good hotel situated right on the boardwalk, great location, fairly clean rooms, friendly staff and awesome pool bar. Review #36:My wife and I and two kids stayed at the Grand for a quick family weekend in OC. The views of the ocean, boardwalk and bay were great (by the shape of the hotel it seems that all of the rooms would have a nice view). I also like the location, it is on the boardwalk so you can get to the pier easily but not too close to the craziness. Our room was clean and very spacious (ours had a nice counter/sink with fridge/etc and a large balcony). The front desk person was friendly and the kids enjoyed the arcade/indoor pool. It was in April so the outdoor pool was closed but it seemed like it would be nice place to hang out, there was a nice poolside bar. The rate was compettiive, everyone liked it, we will definately stay there next time we are in OC. Review #37:I am surprised to see some of the bad reviews written on this page! My wife and I (and our neighbors... we talked to them in the elevator) had an excellent stay. We stayed on a busy weekend, when the hotel was booked to capacity with a bunch of screaming kids. I was concerned about getting sleep, but the hotel staff had it under control. They implemented a curfew for the kids and we slept peacefully. We had a nice ocean view at a reasonable price. We loved the 24 hour coffee shop and the lounge on the first floor! Even though we came in January, the staff knew what to do and where we should go. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. Review #38:We came to Ocean City to celebrate our sons 4th birthday. We are true beach lovers and have stayed at many places in OC. Our main concern was clean, comfortable place to stay that is close to the beach. The hotel was very clean, beds were pretty comfortable, and the view was so so.The rooms are huge but bathrooms very small. We had a grandview room (sort of on the side) but it is not private from your neighbors at all. Probably the only complaint was the elavators. There were only 2 of the 4 working so it made for alot of rude behavior because everyone wanted to go and they werent willing to compromise. Typical! Overall a very nice trip. We would definitely return! Review #39:Stayed here last week. Hotel check in tells us only oversized cars can park in front. We own a cadillac escalade esv and could have rode over all the compact cars parked where the oversized cars should be parking. Main restaurant does not serve lunch or dinner you have to go to pizzeria. We ate there for breakfast, it took 30 minutes for the food and when we asked for ketch up, the was mold around the rim and in the cap itself. In the game room four of the game either did not work or ate your money which meant going down to front desk to get a credit to your room and $1 for a game of Ms. pacman is robbery. We asked at front desk if we can charge services and food to our room. Of course all the restaurants and coffee shop and ice cream parlor scoops all accept our card, so we get it and guess what most places do not take it and everywhere you go signs say cash only. Ok can deal with no hotel room charges but no credit cards, every store though has a cash machine where hey get three bucks per swipe and then your own bank charges you on top of that. And god forbid you complain, the staff then starts speaking in their own language and laughing at you. Hotel is convenient to a lot but the rooms are somewhat run down, we had what looked like someone punched 2 holes in the wall and someone just pasted a piece of wall paper of it and the bathrooms were run down and the ceiling tiles above the 5 lights over the mirror were showing signs of burning from the heat. Review #40:Just returned from a wonderful time at The Grand Hotel. The hotel is kept so nice and clean. Everything is there for you - outdoor pool with towel service, indoor pool, game room, bar, coffee shop and pizzeria right in hotel. The rooms are very large with beautiful views of the ocean. The staff is wonderful - attentive, courteous and friendly. Patrick the General Manager is always available and visible should any problems arise. The housekeeping staff under the direction of Elizabeth is superb. Never did I have to ask for anything - everything was put in my room (towels, shampoo, etc.). The people that work the front desk (Nina, Cara, Levi, Denise, James, Matthew just to name a few) are so nice and quick. The location of the hotel is perfect - far enough away from all the noise of the boardwalk but close enough should you want to be within walking distance (15-20 minute walk). Also the hotel is right on the beach - what more could you ask for!!!! The Grand is Grand and there is no other place I would stay! ! Review #41:I wouldn't stay anywhere else on the boardwalk. The rooms are nice along with the helpful and friendly staff. My family each year just love love love staying at the Grand Hotel from the food to the cheapest shopping in their lovely shops. I would suggest this hotel to anyone that goes to Ocean City. This is one of the most clean hotels that I have stayed at thus far in Ocean City. Review #42:Loved the hotel, my husband and I took my little cousin and her friend june 11-15, it was senior week so at night it was VERY loud. That was no problem! The view was amazing from the 10th floor. Everyone there was super nice everything was clean and well taken care of. I am nothing bad to say about this hotel it was the best hotel we have stayed in so far in OCMD. Thanks everyone at the grand hotel for making our stay wonderful:-) Review #43:Great hotel layout and a great location. Other than that the Hotel is horrible. Our room was musty, the bed was terrible, had wrinkled carpet, ripped wallpaper, stains on the ceiling, broken tile in the bathroom, and a sliding door to the balcony that could only be unlocked and locked with much effort. This was the upgraded room that we were given after refusing to stay in the second floor room that we were given at check-in. It appears that there is no form of maintenance at all in the rooms. There are two pools that are nice other than they are used by anyone (not hotel guests) that wants to use them. The hotel restrooms and exterior showers are also used by anyone and everyone in the area. This would not be a problem if the hotel guests were not impacted by \"public\" use of all of the amenities that we paid for. There was never a hotel employee around at the pools, restrooms, or showers to check to see who was a guest and who was not. If you want to wait by the outside shower to clean off your feet after being at the beach while a family of 10 showers (soap and shampoo included) this is the place for you. I took my son to the game room and we could only find two out of the many games available that would actually work. I would not be so disappointed by the condition of the hotel if I had pulled off of 95 and got a $59.00 room. We paid well over $200.00 per night. I would not recommend this hotel at all. Review #44:What a true disappointment!!! Our kids could not check in the hotel without a parent's signature on a paper stating we would take responsibility. My child was over the age of 18 (isn't that still considered an adult???). During check-in several seniors had to wait for their parents to fax or email this paper. Of course, the hotel was happy to take our child's money before this paper was received. When speaking to the manager, he acted as if he didn't care and basically stated we could find somewhere else. Not very good customer service. Good luck Seniors!! ! Review #45:We recently stayed at the Grand Hotel & Spa in Ocean City, Maryland. The hotel is convieniently located on the boardwalk with many amenities within the hotel itself. We stayed in the King Jacuzzi Suite on the twelveth floor. We encountered a problem with our room on the first night but the manager Kara took care of our concerns and did everything possible to ensure a pleasant stay at the hotel. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience during our stay at the Grand. We reccommend this hotel without reservation. The only suggestion I would make to the hotel would be to add a love seat or sofa in the Jacuzzi Suite to watch television. Thumbs up!! ! Review #46:We stayed at this hotel for the Sand Duels soccer tournament with the U-11 and U-9 girls teams. We typically stay at the Hilton in OC but The Grand Hotel is a better deal. The only downside is that they don't have room service, but the deliver services in OC are great, and you are right on the boardwalk so finding a decent place to eat is EASY. The rooms are clean and spacious, and all have great views. Definitely returning. Review #47:We stayed this past week and I was a little disappointed in the hotel. I've been to Ocean City many times and have stayed at the Rodeway Oceanfront, Quality Inn Boardwalk and the Dunes Manor Hotel. I have always thought the Grand looked so nice so I decided to book it for a friend weekend getaway. I was disapponted in a few things - the ice machines are every other floor and we had to go to 5 different floors before we could fill our very small cooler to take onto the beach, the air conditioning kicked off and on which kept us awake, there is no ventilation in the bathroom such as a fan to remove steam after a shower - which I would think that would cause alot of mold in their walls but who knows...there was constant noise from people opening and closing their sliding glass doors above or beside us, noise from people closing hallway doors, people being loud on the patios - the patios are not private from on another, the elevators didn't work so well and you had to wait forever. I dealt with a person at the front desk who was very nice the first day and the rest of the time the staff wasn't so nice. For what we paid here, I was a little disappointed. Overall it was OK but I think that it looked so much better than what I experienced. Review #48:This was my husband's and I first time at the Grand celebrating our 1st year anniversary and we enjoyed every bit of it. We had a direct oceanfront view on the top and we couldn't have asked for anything more. Whenever we did have an issue, housekeeping and/or maintenance addressed our concerns immediately and efficiently. The service was great, hotel was clean and the employees were courtesy. We didn't eat at the hotel so I cannot comment on the food. The only thing that bothered me were the elevators. One was out of service one day and on another day it was slow. But honestly, it didn't bother us or interfere with our overall stay which is why I'm giving it a rating of 5 stars. Review #49:I loved your hotel! We still talk about it. We have reccomended it to several friends. i have been going to OC for years and haven't stayed in a nicer room. We had an Oceanfront room and it was clean and the bed was comfortable. The room was not your usual beach hotel room, it was much fancier. We got a really good rate because of it being Thanksgiving week, and for $10 more we were able to upgrade. Location was awesome. Lobby was beautiful, with Christmas music playing and everyone was friendly including the front desk staff and the bartender. Would consider going back this Thanksgiving and staying with you again. Do you offer any packages for Thanksgiving? Review #50:Nina Railean was especially helpful at accomodating our needs, even when they seemed to be unpleasant in any circumstance. She went out of her way to ensure that we recieved quality assistance and accomodation in order to make our honeymoon an enjoyable one. We really appreciated her efforts and hope to return in the future. Thank you, Nina! Review #51:I am pleased to say that my wife and I had a really great experience at the Grand Hotel. Nice oceanfront room with a gigantic balcony. Action packed hotel/area with great choices of food, beverage and of course the Atlantic Ocean just 20 steps from the back door. Mr. Staib, the general manager runs a clean cut operation. Staff were friendly and accommodations were clean and comfortable. Being a GM of a hotel, I can appreciate being a guest especially in an environment such as the Grand Hotel. Keep up the great job and we will look forward to seeing you again next year! Review #52:Our association has been using the Grand for the past 4 years and we have had nothing but the best service. The staff are very friendly and caring, especially Robin, Nina, Anna and Erin. They made a point of going out of their way to accomodate our every needs. If there were any concerns, the staff immediately took care of them. Review #53:Although I personally thought this was a nice hotel in a great location I can see how some people would be a bit dissapointed. We paid for an Oceanveiw room and were placed on the ground floor with a veiw of the roof. (Why dont they put a pool here?) We couldnt really see the ocean from our room but it was something we could deal with. Although the rooms seemed clean they were very dark and frankly depressing. When you go to a beach hotel, you want light and color! I liked the indoor and outdoor pool area and the pool bar. I would stay here agian if they lowered the rates. For what you get I dont think its worth the inflated prices they try to charge. If you are coming with family rent a condo at the Ocean hideaway or seagate instead and save $$$!!! ! Review #54:Just returned fromOcean City Maryland.We stayed at the Grand Hotel and Spa on 21st.Very clean and well kept.The rooms overlooking the ocean are breathtaking.Their balconies are very large.Location is great and staff is friendly.The pool area is wonderful u are treated to a towel and pillow on your lounge chair and the bar is an added touch.Cant say enough good things about this Hotel.Would definately return there again! ! Review #55:Fourth of July week we stayed at the grand for 7 nights. It was very nicely located with a 24 hours cafe downstairs, 2 pools , 2 bars and some beach stores to shop in. The beach was just a few steps away and very clean. The beds were comfortable, housekeeping was very welcoming and helpful, and the room was very clean. the only thing I wish I had for paying such good money would be a newer television and free hott breakfast of some kind. Overall the stay was great and staff was friendly. See you next year ! Review #56:I Understand that fire alarms are there to protect us but we have stayed here for the past six or seven years and have been evacuated every year. Some years more than once. For me its an inconvience and annoying. For my kids its scarey. My seven year old is scared to go back. Last year he couldnt sleep and grinded his teeth all night long. The fire alarm went off of course and then the rest of our vacation he wanted to go home! It was a nightmare. Its a shame because we like everything else about this hotel. Nice hotel with a major fire alarm problem! Review #57:I booked this for a \"girl friends only getway\" I asked for a room with a great view. The front desk staff assured me of a great view and she was right! wonderful view from the nice large CLEAN room. The staff was very nice and polite! Review #58:After reading the reviews here, I was probably more likely to be on the lookout for negatives. That said, our stay was perfectly comfortable. We booked a month in advance for a wedding and were given a rate of around $120 for an ocean view room (I believe all the rooms are ocean view). When we checked in, I noticed what some of the reviews have complained about: a faint smoke smell, some older furnishings, etc. We were next to a standard room that seemed to be filled with about a dozen guys in their 20s who were partying in their room and on the balcony. We wanted a quiet night, so we called down for a room change. At first the clerk wanted to charge us $75 to downgrade to a room with a worse view (we didn't really care about the view at this point), but after speaking to his manager, he upgraded us to non-smelly, recently updated room on the 11th floor. And it was quiet! After the room change we were much happier. The only negatives were that the a/c was very loud when it cycled on and that light fixture in the bathroom seemed to be causing the paint to melt, which seemed like a safety concern. All in all we had a comfortable stay, but if we had stayed in the original room or had to pay $75 for a quiet room, I would probably be writing a negative review. Review #59:Positives: Our room was very clean, large, and the bed was comfortable. We had a small refrigerator in the room which was nice for snacks and leftovers. The staff was courteous and helpful. The spa was VERY nice to have right in the hotel (I had a pedicure). You literally walk out of the hotel onto the boardwalk, no steps to go up or down. There was a parking garage right next door so our car did not have to bake in the sun (which was appreciated during the nearly 100 degree days). Negatives: Breakfast in the restaurant was only ok and very over-priced. The walls were a bit thin and we could hear our neighbor's TV and could even hear them talking. The air conditioning unit was set to \"auto\" and was glued so it could not be changed. This caused the air to turn on and off constantly as the thermostat adjusted. Normally this would not be an issue, but the unit was so loud each time it turned on, that it sometimes woke us up during the night. Though there is direct boardwalk access, the hotel is located toward the upper end which makes for a LONG walk to any of the attractions. Overall: We were glad to have a clean and comfortable room on the boardwalk, but will probably try another hotel closer to the boardwalk attractions next time. Review #60:Very nice place to stay. Great value with very clean and well kept rooms and facilities.Couldn't ask for much better at the beach. Coffee shop open 24hrs where you can get just about anything to eat such as bagels, donuts, pizza, ice cream, sandwiches, drinks,etc.Good accomodations in the room but could use one more lamp and a comfortable lounging chair. Had one problem with teenagers at 3:00AM which took Security too long to respond. Aside from that problem I would definitely stay there again. Very nice and on the beach. Good parking in front of building and with an undercover dropoff area. Parking garage only a short walk across street. Courteous workers. Review #61:This is a very clean family oriented hotel, with great services, and locations to everything. I highly recommend this hotel for your next stay weather it's with your family or just as a couple to get away to enjoy the spa, bar, or just to spend time on the beach... Review #62:This is an older hotel, however, it has undergone a renovation. I've stayed at this hotel three years in a row now, mostly because of the price. Nice hotels in Ocean City are just TOO EXPENSIVE! This hotel is somewhat over priced as well. But it is the nicest hotel in its price range in Ocean City. Everything about this hotel is average. In past years, it was not as clean as my stay this past summer. But is was very clean this summer. The rooms are okay. Almost all have ocean views. They are also a nice size. The balconies are very old. The internet service was SHOTTY at best. Review #63:This is located on 21st street, a bit of a walk from boardwalk activities and restaurants. Stayed in room 1112 (11th floor center). Room average, you can get same room quality for less at other hotels. View was breath taking!!!! Outside pool located on parking lot side in order to get afternoon and sunset sun. Pool is kind of small. Pool bar is great and food is good. I rented the cabana by the pool one day and was worth it, however it was only set up for two people, so if you need more than that, you should go around 10am to check in with attendant to get more chairs. It was $50 for all day. You can leave and come back if you want. Review #64:Very bad experience! First off all for the amount of money you pay you get Zero customer service! The rooms are ok! Not that great. They charged us around $640.00 more than what we were suppose to pay just by \"accident\" thank God my husband noticed it and when we confronted the front desk not that she didnt apologize, she even gave us an attitute! It was so fraustrating! :( We went to let the manager \"patrick\" know and he took his employee's side and gave us a very cold apology that you could see he doesnt even mean it. He didn't even ask us if here is anything he could do for us or anyway we can leave with a good experience! Nothing!!!! Even when we asked for just a couple of hours of late check out he said no!!!! Never will book here again! They are so many nice hotels ocean front and so much cheaper! Do your research!!!! ! Review #65:I really loved \"The Grand\"! My boyfriend and I got the Weekend Escape Package and had a wonderful time. We didn't like the location of the room because it was on the outter side of the building so we asked from another room with a better view. Kyle had no problem accommodating us within our package's terms. The room was clean, beds were very comfortable and the price was well worth it. Arlene was also very helpful. The bartender was very sweet and personable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone! Review #66:Our family of four stayed in a Premier view room which they told me was a sideview, unobstructed. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought we were in an oceanfront room. The view of the ocean was great. The hotel sits right on the board walk, but not in a crazy busy section - perfect for families. The ocean was so close; it was amazing. Every staff member was professional and courteous. Check in was fast and easy. We could usually park right in the front parking lot; but there is also a ramp garage right next to the hotel that always had plenty of spots. The room was larger than most hotel rooms. Two queen beds and plenty of room for a roll-a-way ($10 per nite) and plenty of room to walk around. Good kitchen space - microwave, sink, plenty of cupboards, refridgerator, coffee maker. Bathroom was a bit small but had plenty of counterspace and a large mirror. We had a bit of a problem opening the sliding door to the balcony. We called the front desk, and somebody was there within 5 minutes. He stated they were in the process of replacing all the sliding doors (3 floors had already been completed) and showed us some tricks to make sliding the door open easier (the track was bent), For the price, location, cleanliness, convenience of being right on the boardwalk and having both an indoor and outdoor pool plus the shops and restaurants right there in the hotel, the Grand cannot be beat! We would definitely stay here again! Can't wait for next summer! Review #67:Over the years, we have stayed at numeous hotels when visiting Ocean City. Once we discovered the Grand Hotel, we don't even consider another location. The staff are very accommodating, clean rooms are in good repair, wireless Internet access is available, small stores on the boardwalk side offer a cafe, pizza shop and various small shops. When we visit during \"Cruise-In\" weekends, you can get a coffee and donut from the cafe and sit on the boardwalk in front of the hotel to watch the cruiser parade. We love it! The Grand Hotel's location close to the end of the boardwalk is perfect for us to walk to most of our favorite destinations. A parking garage offers plenty of parking space. Our only bad experience during the most recent trip was with the Terrace Restaurant; I don't know if it is managed by the hotel or an outside group but I wouldn't recommend going to the restaurant for breakfast. Review #68:We planned a quick vacation for 3 days, we came across The Grand Hotel thur ocean city's website.The rooms were very clean, they had everything that you needed in the room. the rooms were very nice. Every room in the hotel has a view of the boardwalk and the ocean. (side view or ocean front) There were 2 pool 1 outside and 1 inside. The outside pool was very nice it had a pool bar. they say that you could also order food there but the 2 diffrent days that we tried we were told that they were too busie to order (overpriced)food. The inside pool was nice but smelled too much like bleach. They have a breakfast buffet on the six floor, Pass it up the food is awful (my kids would not eat it the food was not hot, luke warm) also when you walked out side of the hotel (entrance from parking lot) the smell of trash was overwellming. They keep ther dumpsters inside two overhead doors. Review #69:We stayed overnight at Grand Hotel on June 14 so my daughter and her friend can go to H20 that night. The hotel was located right on the boardwalk and a walking distance to the main attractions of OC boardwalk as well as few steps to the beach. You also have the option to use the tram or bus. The hotel is near everything-food, shopping, mini golf etc. The room was spacious and clean. The balcony was also a plus-nice view of the ocean. The front desk staff were all helpful and very polite. I felt safe letting my teen & her friend do their own thing while me and my 11 yr old son did ours. We were even able to enjoy the beach the following day during our checkout date since we didn't have to move our car out of the parking garage till 2pm. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to couples, families with kids or teens and even seniors. I was also lucky to get the room at a great price since it was early June and I booked it a while ago. Review #70:Perfect location but rooms and amenities in general need some serious updates. Looks worn out and rusty. Beds are so cheap and the lowest quality, it's screaming for replacement. This could easily be a top notch hotel in Ocean City, if the interiors and facilities are upgraded to current or at least 4-star standards. Review #71:Very nice hotel. Rooms are great layout and size wise. They were clean and comfortable with nice views and balcony. Swimming pools (indoor and outdoor) were nice and clean. Fitness center could use some updating but still was very usable. The bathroom was nice with decent space and had a decent layout. The hotel was clean inside and out, and even the parking garage. Always had plenty of parking for me and my friends' car. Perfect location on the boardwalk, you can walk right out onto it and walk all the way up and down. Will stay there again, I had no problems what so ever and I must say the A/C and Heat worked great! I had a mini fridge and microwave with a wet bar / sink. If they could improve it would be better tv's like plasma or lcd, but the size was good. Review #72:The rooms are really large and have small kitchenettes. Each room has a balcony. The only issue was that there were no solid dividers between balconies so you could hear and partially see the people next to you. There was a mesh screen of some sort between balconies. The place is very large and they have a restaurant that serves lunch and breakfast. We enjoyed sitting around the pool and having frozen drinks from the pool bar. It is quite a walk to the activities on the boardwalk but there is a tram that runs down the boardwalk. My daughter really enjoyed playing chess with the giant chess set. Review #73:Overpriced, cheap furniture, bad flooring(carpet lifting) wallpaper peeling, tight bathroom, water malfunction in the tub took forever to go down, pregnant back tv, really, my child couldn't hook his game up, no wi fi for our stay there, according to them bad weather, hmmm, is we not in the same place, hmmm, yu'll pull a muscle trying to open the balcony door, plastic ran down chairs on the balcony, and the curtains were dirty.....and fo the $$$$'s we paid. What a Lovely stay #bookelsewhere Review #74:We stayed in a \"Direct Ocean Front\" on the 7th floor. The view was the boardwalk going North and the beach. We arrived at Monday, Labor Day about 3pm. They said our room was not ready and would call us when it was. The regualr time for check in is 4pm. We decided to take a walk down the boards. Received a call about 4:10pm and checked in. When we opened the door it was an oder like bad feet. The room was tidy and clean but the carpet was all lumpy. We're not sure where the oder was coming from but I thought it had to be the carpet. The room was large and had a balcony that is not private. So, when I went out to read there was someone else out on their balcony. The bathroom was small but clean. They had toiletries if needed. They had a restaurant for breakfast and lunch. We ate breakfast and it was good. The 24 hour coffee cafe has donuts and all kinds of bakery goods and will make breakfast and lunch sandwhiches any time of the day or night. Their coffee wasn't Starbucks or Ducan Donuts but was drinkable. Philips Seafood restaurant was across the street and liquor store and Dairy Queen also. They have a nice beach. They have a safe, and micro kitchen also. We asked for a late check out and there was no problem. I would stay there again but I hope they freshen the rooms. Review #75:My husband, two kids (ages 9 and 11) and Iarrived at this hotel last minute without a reservation at 7am on a Friday morning. We were very fortunate to find this place during the weekend of the Dew Tour. The lady at the front desk was very kind and there were plenty of staff available to help with people checking in and out. The lady helping us provided us with a reservation for that day (checkin at 4pm) but allowed us to checkin at 7am so my husband and I could get some rest since we had been driving all night. The room was very clean! Spacious bathroom and plenty of clean towels for all of us. We did not have an ocean view room, but with the way the hotel is designed we could still see the ocean from our room. There was a refrigerator in the room along with a coffee maker and a variety of coffee packets and vending machines on each floor. The kids loved the arcade and the indoor and outdoor pool. The staff at the pool was excellent providing us with towels so we did not have to take our beach towels from the beach to the pool and treck all the sand back to the pool with us - which we thought was great! We would def. stay here again. Review #76:The Grand doesn't live up to name . The hotel is a diamod location and the bones of the building are good but as a gem ...Its a pearl at best. The room had wall paper pealing apart ( rm 411), The funiture was very cheap and took away instantly from any wow factor that should be with this Grand building. No drink cups in bathroom, ceiling fan in bathroom not working. All and all the Grand was like a bad xmas package....Wrapped very nice on internet and to look at but not much inside ! Hint... Go to a Borgata.... Grand,,hint hint ...inside and out ! Oh and AC very noisy.in room. Disturbed sleep every time it came on. Review #77:My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Hotel from Aug 28-Aug 30 for a quick getaway. The hotel is what is it. But is served its purpose for the 2 nights we were there. The positives: the location (walking distance from the Boardwalk and the beach), the hotel seems to have everything (clothing stores, salon, ice cream parlor, pizza place) on its premises. The negatives: not the cleanest, no wifi in the rooms (only available in the lobby--how ghetto is that!! ), you can't connect DVD or video games console to the TV for the rare moment you want to stay in and watch movies, their restaurant only serves breakfast, the rooms have 2 queen sized HARD beds (king size is not an option). All in all, our stay was overall OK but could be better. We won't be staying here on our next OC excursion. Review #78:Very nice hotel and friendly people. Nice and clean rooms. The bathrooms however, are SO tiny it is very hard to get around in them. The one thing I very much dislike are the balconies. There is absolutely no privacy on them. They have bars up that separates them and they do that so you get the most out of your view but like i said, there is just no privacy. I don't want to go out and sit there with my neighbors looking right at me!! That is my one major complaint about this hotel. Everything else was very nice. Review #79:Just got back from oc. I really liked this hotel the rooms and hotel were very clean and the staff very friendly and nice. We had a room on the side and still had a great view of the ocean. I also liked the 24 hour coffee shop. What i did not like is that you could not bring your own drinks and snacks to the pool they did have a bar at the pool which was way overpriced after all you are on vacation you should be able to relax and enjoy yourself at the pool. the only other thing i wish they had was a hot tub that would be perfect Review #80:We spent the weekend at The Grand Hotel this past weekend and it couldn't have been better. Service was excellent, the room was very clean, the view was unbeatable, and the staff couldn't do enough for us. We will be staying there again soon. Review #81:For the 5th year in a row we have stayed at the Stowaway Grand Hotel. It is a great place to stay. The design of the hotel is such that almost every room has a wonderful ocean view. The only down sides are that it is very pricey and the cleaning service could do a little better job. Here's a tip..instead of getting reservations - just show up. We did and saved $100.00 per night! Review #82:My husband and I just returned from a short jaunt to OC We stayed at the Grand Hotel and Spa. We had a marvelous time! The hotel is located on the boardwalk and has everything you'll need for your stay. We enjoyed the whirlpool tub in our room and the small kitchenette. We had a great view of the Atlantic Ocean and the beach. There is an indoor and outdoor pool, bars, and a spa. The beach was very clean, unlike many years ago. I would definitely recommend this hotel! Review #83:Very clean and large rooms with awesome views from the balcony. Front desk staff was extremely helpfull and courteous. The hotel is a great location on boardwalk and only steps away from the ocean. Rooms were great with the kitchenette and queen size beds were very comfortable. This was our first stay at the Grand and will definately choose this location in the future. Pools were clean, restaurant was great and was nice having parking so convenient. We have stayed at other hotels on boardwalk but none compare to the quality,service,price and location of the Grand. AAA +++ Review #84:The hotel is clean, most of the rooms have a good to exellent view of the ocean, well located. The rooms themselves will need an upgrade soon. it sems as the sliding doors to the balcony all need to be serviced or repaired. My biggest problem with the Stowaway Grand is tuesday nights when they rent out the meeting room and turn it into a nightclub with extremly loud Bass that reverberates thru the hotel into all the adjoing floors until 3 am. if for any reason you wake up ,its enough to keep most people awake until they are done. the staff is very apologetic and claim there is nothing that can be done. The manager reduced my rate for that nite because I complained. I believe that if the hotel continually loses money on tues nites the management may finally get rid of the tues nite loudness. My belief is that waking guests up for something like this is one of the cardinal sins of the hotel business. We were woken up at other times the same week by the fire alarm, twice in one nite. this not being the hotels fault. once was someone smoking ciggarettes in the room. I believe they recieved a 500 dollar fine and the major cause of fire alarm emergencies would be improper use of the microwave ovens. it seems to me that someone would really have to be a bad cook to set off the fire alarm with a microwave but they claim thats there number 1 problem. Other than these problems the hotel has the potential to be real nice place, I just wish they could fix those problems and this could be a real top notch hotel in Ocean City Md. Review #85:We got an ocean view room with two double beds. It was one of the most SPACIOUS rooms we have gotten in an oceanfront hotel! You could easily fit a queen air mattress on the floor and have tons of space. There was also a kitchenette with a medium-sized fridge. Beds were comfortable, and on the main floor of the hotel were several shops and restaurants. Best of all, it was right on the beach and boardwalk! It is a bit away from the main attractions of the boardwalk, but there is a tram that comes every 15 mins for $3 a ride (exact change only). The outdoor pool was LOVELY, even though there were a LOT of small children. The staff sets up chairs for you, with towel service. There is also an indoor pool open till 11pm. They were also willing to give us as many parking passes as we needed. Great place to stay with friends! Review #86:We visit Ocean City every Summer at least once, and have found the Stoaway Grand to be the best bang for the buck. Great location - on the boardwalk away from main traffic, but close enough for easy walk to amusement area. Always pretty clean and convenient inc. a 24 hour coffee shop downstairs. Although It is nice to see new top end hotels going in like the Hilton and Marriott - I just can't justify spending $ 429.00 and up to stay at one of them at Ocean City ! We payed $ 200 a night this week - it goes up a bit in July and August., but not much. Great parking too, a huge parking garage just steps away from front door, something many don't have. We will continue to go to the Grand every time ! Review #87:it's got it all...pool, shops, restaurant, coffee shop, quiet end of boardwalk location, great views from oceanfront rooms. Rooms on 11th Fl were clean and very comfy. Oh, they have a pool bar too. I will stay again. Review #88:Actually I'm here right now and all I can say is do not come here memorial weekend it's gang weekend and not a place for young kids we haven't sleep in two days cause they take over the whole hotel wit there loud music and there loins bikes and I guess the managment doesn't care cause they rent out like 50 rooms first time here n probably last such a shame'!!! ! Review #89:This hotel has seen better days. It sits on prime beachfront property, yet no money has been put back into the building itself. The rooms are large, very DARK, so dark it was hard to see to iron my clothing. Dark red carpet (stained), very dark furniture (from the 80's) and dark red and green comforters on the beds, makes it so gloomy! The price refects the shape of the property. There is a new Hilton right down the road that was 289.00 per night during this same week and the rate here was about 100 bucks, my vote, pay the extra for the name brand hotel. This property is in sad shape, I just went to the 6th floor to check out the \"shipwreck\" restaurant, it was closed, and through the door, I could see dirt on the floor and a broken glass window inside, yes, a shipwreck. Review #90:We stayed on the 9th floor for a long weekend in January. The hotel was clean, the room was clean and we had a great view of the ocean. We loved the extra features of the hotel, like the Shipwreck Lounge, Ice Cream/Coffee Shop, pool and the other shops. Staying here is like staying at a mini all inclusive hotel. Ideas for improvements would be: It would have been nice to have a couch in our room so that we could sit and drink coffee while viewing the ocean (we had dbl queen beds and a small table with chairs. There is 1 other chair (at the desk) in the room. The room sleeps 4 but only has 3 chairs, so someone had to sit on the bed to eat, talk, relax, etc. Couch and cozy chair would have made it much nicer. Another suggestion would be to upgrade to a flat screen tv. Our tv was small and the picture is not as clear as HD. Also, it would have been nice to have some basic dishes, silverware and napkins in the kitchen area. When we went to get ice cream, almost all of the flavors were empty, so we really only had a choice of 3 flavors. Hand lotion would be a great plus in the ladies room! Also, the stores were not open during our stay. It was super nice having the parking garage!!! We enjoyed not having to worry about parking. We do plan on coming back, but would love to see some upgrades as this could really be a SUPER hotel. Thank you. Review #91:We had a really nice time. Room was decent, check in was easy. They originally offered the 3rd floor, but when we requested a higher floor, they did their best to accomodate us and we got the 8th floor (which had a great view). We got there before check in and were able to park, use the pool and enjoy the day. Asked for extra pillows and got them right away. Location was perfect. Pizza place around the corner had a lot to be desired (would not recommend it). Loved Fish Tails, which was just a few blocks over. Beach was awesome. Saw tons of dolphins. Pool was nice too. Would definitely go back. Review #92:We stayed at the Grand Aug 19-21 and had a nice room on the 6th floor. The room was very spacious, large bathroom, and nice area outside of the bathroom with \"kitchen sink\", countertop, cabinets, and microwave. This was an unexpected plus since we had our 7month old baby with us. We had no real complaints about the place, except for the food at the breakfast restaurant. The spa service (massage) was excellent, and the hotel location is good as well. Our friend was in a room on the 2nd floor, and while the size was the same, her room was tiled, and not carpeted like ours upstairs. I did prefer the carpet. Her view was the roof of the stores below, so definitely higher is better. When she complained at the desk, they told her it was b/c she did not book directly through the hotel (she used Orbitz, just as the others in our parties did), and there was nothing they could do about it b/c they were filled to capacity. She was not amused by their reasoning. The rest of us who used Orbitz were on the 6th floor and had no problems. For Ocean City, I think The Grand is worth serious consideration. Review #93:I have stayed at The Grand Hotel several times. I love staying here because of the day spa conveniently located in the lobby. Each visit I stayed in the king/jacuzzi tub room - oceanfront, of course. I love going downstairs and getting a massage by Karen. She is GREAT! She remembers me each visit and welcomes me with a warm smile. I have been all over town getting massages and she is the BEST! I highly recommend a stay here and a visit to the salon/day spa! Review #94:My husband and I stayed at the Grand for our 30th anniversary last month and our experience could not have been better. For years, we have tried to include massages into our OC trips without success. When I saw the Romance Package (jacuzzi in the room, dinner voucher at choice of 4 restaurants and massages right in the hotel spa), we went for it. What a great deal!! Room was beautiful and squeaky clean. Staff was very courteous and helpful. They called our room approx. 2 hours after we checked in to ask if we had everything we needed. (That was a first for me!) The view from the room was stunning and you are right on the boardwalk. The spa staff was friendly & highly-skilled. The only negative for us was the fact that the restaurant is closed in the off-season. Overall, it was the weekend we have been trying to have for years. We have already booked our next trip for October. Review #95:Good staff, lots of amenities. B U T... Where there would normally be a sofa or an easy chair with a lamp, there was a great big space! I went to the desk to inquire about the policy of no comfortable chair. She said each room was the same. I found that hard to believe. I told her that I have been all over the world and have never seen a hotel room without some kind of chair to relax and read the paper. Next day, I peeked in some other rooms being cleaned. She was right. This may be a petty nit pick but I was very dissatisfied. These folks charge up to $329 per night for the room I was in. Disclaimer, I stayed off season rate of $100. My bottom line, never again Review #96:I stayed at the Hotel on fourth of July even though it was full house they manage to keep it clean planty of parking friendly staff, conveniently lacated, with sliding doors closed you don't hear a thing of whats going on outside. This was my first time at hotel and I'll be back, more than I can say about other hotels in Ocean City.I stayed there once i don't come back many hotels in Ocean City have rude employees, Review #97:If you are looking for a place to stay in OC that has your best interests at heart, don't stay at the Grand Hotel on 21 street. We stayed there for Memorial weekend and it was a disaster! A motorcycle association and church group were staying there at the same time. Don't mind bikers, don't mind churches, do mind loud music 24-7 and the all night party the hotel and city aloud in their garage parking, by-the-way, can't park out front of the hotel. Woudl NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone! Would only give a \"below expectations\" rating if there were one. I hope everyone reads my review before they book here! Review #98:Never in my life have I experienced such rude and ignorant service but any member in the hospitality industry - especially by the front desk Manager - Nina. The hotel booked my reservation for the wrong date, refused to give me a refund, and made my group pay full price for an extra night. The staff at this hotel cannot be trusted and are borderline scam artists. They are rude and do not understand any aspect of the hospitality industry. Also, if you are looking to stay at a hotel close to Seacrets - this is not it. I will never stay at this hotel again and I urge you to do the same. Review #99:For a beach town, this hotel was definitely good. My family just stayed there this past 4th of July week and got a 5 day special for the week, so the rates were good. There are no 4 or 5 star hotels in OC so this was better then what I expected. Location wise, it's right on the boardwalk but not in the heart of the activity, which is good because you don't get the noise of the crowds and events. The rooms were large enough for a family of 4. However, the windows on the sliders to the balcony overlooking the beach were foggy. They really need to clean them regularly because of all the salt water residue from being on the beach. When we had them try and clean them, it would not come clean at all. Also they really need to dust the lampshades! The amount of dust that came off the lampshade when it was accidentally brushed into created a cloud of dust. The bathrooms are tiny and the knob to turn the water on in the shower fell off, but we easily popped that back on. Lastly, we ate in their restaurant for breakfast on the first morning there. It took an hour before the got our food served, for breakfast! We went down the street to Sahara Cafe for breakfast each morning after that, for much better service and food. Otherwise the staff was friendly and helpful, both at the front desk, and the pool. I would stay here again.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

We got in very late, (12 am), the first night & were greeted by two very nice & helpful staff members. Anything we needed the staff would immediately accommodate us & they also had great suggestions on where to go for entertainment, etc. The food in the restaurant was incredible, the chocolate torte was most delectable and the waiter, Martine, never rushed us, even after the restaurant was closed; although, the maitre de was not so friendly, he was actually very rude both times we tried to dine there. The rooms were so comfortable with a goose down comforter and big bathroom. My room had a balcony & living room which was great since we were traveling with friends; when they came over we could \"entertain\" in our suite. I loved the location because we were a step a way from everything...we did so much walking. The jazz festival was 5 blocks north, the port was one block south and touristy stuff was a few blocks away. I had a great time & would definitely stay there again. Review #1:My boyfriend and I decided to visit old Montreal for the weekend and I found great reviews about this hotel. It definitely did not dissappoint! The staff were extremely friendly and always willing to help. The hotel was very clean and we ended up getting a free upgrade to a suite. The bed was very comfortable! We are definitely coming back to this hotel when we visit in the summer. Highly recommended! Review #2:My stay at this hotel was simply wonderful. I loved the decor of the lobby and the friendly service upon checking in. I arrived around 10:30pm and needed a dining suggestion and the lady at the front desk gave me a nice place to dine about five minutes by foot. This historical section of Montreal is worth the stay. The architecture and history are very interesting. I had a delicious breakfast every morning by room service. Always arrived on time. The room itself is very spacious with a large bathroom and a great view overlooking the main street. My interactions with the staff to be very friendly and ready to help me when I needed it. The Concierge were especially helpful with directions and suggestions for dinner and sightseeing. I highly recommend staying here. Not many hotels in Montreal are as charming as this place. Review #3:Just returned from a 2-day stay at the Saint Sulpice. Very comfortable and quiet. I would not hesitate to go back. I found the best rate through bonjourquebec. Cheap delicious breakfast just around the corner at Cafe St. Paul (on St. Paul St.). Review #4:My partner and I stayed here on the final leg of a NYC to Montreal road trip and there was no better place to round off the holiday. Friendly staff, a very knowledgeable concierge, well equipped, spacious rooms and a lovely elegant feel throughout. If you're considering booking a stay here, you won't be disappointed! Review #5:This is a very late review and is coming on the heels of some terrible service at another hotel. This bad experience had me thinking \"jeez, these guys need to learn a little customer service from..... and Woila...Le Saint Sulpice popped in my mind. I was traveling on business for what turned out to be a difficult customer install which left me stressed out at the end of every day. So it was great to come back to a very welcoming staff and clean elegant room everyday. With a great neighborhood full of shops, restaurants , and art galleries I never had to venture far if I didn't want to. Then there is the beautiful church right on the corner along with the charming narrow cobblestone streets which made you really feel like you were in \"Old World\" Montreal. On top of the great ambience, the service I received was the best. I had arrived during hockey playoffs and was intent on watching my favorite team being a die hard team. Cruising the channels I couldn't find it and was scrambling to figure out what station it might be on. Not knowing the stations in Canada, I called down to the front desk. The desk immediately sent some one up( someone into sports) and they went through all the channels with me and when we couldn't find it, he then used the internet to verify what station it should've been on(which it wasn;t) after apologizing for something that was beyond his control, I thanked him and proceeded to stew about not being able to watch. Ten minutes later, he comes back up and had found a canadian site streaming the game online. I promptly found the site and ended up happily watching the game. While this may seem trivial, to me it was going the extra mile as he saw how p***** off I was. They were also great with tips on restaurants, directions etc. I gladly recommend this place and look forward to bringing the wife back for a romantic trip. Review #6:Our family stayed for four nights in a one-bedroom suite at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel St-Sulpice while I was attending a conference at the Palais des Congr\u00c3\u00a8s. We were very pleased with the hotel. The front staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient. The lobby had a European charm, and the our room was very comfortable and modern-looking. (Although it was quite cozy for us, with a rambunctious toddler and a baby.) The hotel was very quiet, which was appreciated! The complimentary Internet service and nightly bottled water service were nice touches. The included continental breakfast was also good. The restaurant had excellent food at dinner, including a children's menu, although the service was average. The location can't be beat \u00e2\u20ac\u201d adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica and very close to lots of lovely restaurants throughout Old Montreal. Review #7:We just returned from 3 wonderful nights at the Saint Sulpice. We splurged for the mid-priced suite and weren't dissapointed. We had a large living room and bedroom, the bathroom was very large with a great tub and walk-in shower. Service was excellent, I broke the hairdryer in the middle of drying my hair before we were going out to dinner, and in less than 5 minutes they brought me a new one. Great location -- very short walk to the Metro. Only thing that needs improvement is the \"gym\". Outdated treadmills and very dark gym room. Other than that, I highly, highly recommend. Review #8:From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I knew I had picked the right place for my weekend stay. The staff was warm and friendly, the concierge was incredibly helpful, and within 30 minutes after I'd entered my room, a staff member was already at my door to offer free water and see if everything was okay. The bed was incredibly soft and comfy, and the bathroom had both a shower and large tub, along with ample toilette space in the middle for all of my things. On top of all that, the room itself was gigantic - probably bigger than a studio apartment. The hotel is indeed right in the heart of Old Montreal, literally just behind the Notre Dame Cathedral and only a few blocks from a Metro stop. Extremely convenient, warm, friendly and efficient - would definitely stay over and over again! Review #9:We signed up for a Snique Away deal and were rewarded with a very nice vacation and hotel. The suite layout was perfect for our family of four and while we did not attempt to cook we appreciated the kitchenette. Nice big bathtub and roomy shower. Quiet rooms. Great location. Plenty of room to spread out. No complaints. Fold out couch was comfortable and spacious. Thanks Snique Away. Review #10:Really, a wonderful hotel. In four nights we kept waiting to find SOMETHING that would disappoint us, but never did. From the first Bon jour! as we pulled up out front, we were greeted time and again not with a robotic mumble but with a genuinely warm greeting, as if from old friends. Lobby was stylish without being weird, as was most of Montreal. Comfortable, relaxed. And the room - mon dieu! (Pardon the attempts at french - Montreal will do that to you!) Absolutely gorgeous suite with entrance including closet and a wonderfully handy little table to drop your keys, maps, change etc, then a well equipped kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, stove, etc. Incidentally, we have stayed at some 5 star resorts (when we can catch a great bargain) all over North America and never before have we had a full sized coffee maker with TEN cups of great french roast every morning. Anway, from the kitchenette you enter the living room with a pull out couch, fireplace, and flat screen tv. Separate bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable bed with thick down comforter and another flat screen. With doors to bedroom closed was as quiet as our own country home - we slept like babies! Bathroom was beautiful with luxurious towels, great soaps and lotions, very elegant glass sink and extra large (two person!) shower stall/deep bath tub. Location is just behind the extraordinary Notre-Dame cathedral, in the heart of Old Montreal, with tons of stuff immediately nearby and a subway station two blocks away. I swear if I could have justified it, I would have made reservations for our next stay when I was checking out this last time! Review #11:My husband and I stayed at the Sulpice after Christmas through the New Year and were absolutely in love with it! We were given an upgraded room because it was our honeymoon so we had a huge room with fireplace, balcony (winter so not really useful), a separate bedroom, separate shower with huge soaker tub and a very well stocked kitchenette. The service was absolutely unbeatable....the staff were always polite, helpful and very prompt if we needed wood, towels or reservations. We were surprised with a unique New Years Gift and were always delighted with the turn down service with weather report in the evenings! The free breakfast was okay, we prefer Eggspectations, but free is free! We did not eat in the restaurant for dinner, but heard others rave about it. We also used the massage therapists in the gym and both my husband and I had amazing massages that were well worth the money. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the Sulpice and would stay there again, actually we are planning our next trip to Montreal already! Review #12:This was our first visit to Montreal and we chose Le Saint Sulpice based on the glowing tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed! Our room was actually a small apartment--separate bedroom, living room w/electric fireplace, kitchenette, balcony overlooking the outdoor dining area and gardens and a large, extremely well appointed bath. Grohe fixtures, a beautiful molded glass vanity, large tub and an enormous shower. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, the furnishings were very nice and the queen bed was comfortable with high quality linens. As a coffee addict, I especially appreciated a large, 12 cup coffee maker supplied with a more than acceptable blend--no tiny pot dribbling out foul brown water like most hotels. The location of the hotel is superb--right next to Notre Dame, an easy walk to the Metro and in the heart of Old Montreal. My only quibbles: some of the walls were scarred in places and in need of repair and paint and the carpet was stained and frayed in spots. As a previous reviewer noted, pets are allowed in some of the rooms and I suspect the carpet issues can be attributed to that. All in all--a very pleasant experience in a wonderfully unique city. Review #13:The staff are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and courteous... they truly know what customer service means. The location is phenomonal... in the heart of the beautiful old city. The rooms are warm, spacious with good amenities... the attention to detail in all aspects are commendable. I travel often but usually just stay at the must economic choice. This place was worth splurging on... an amazing weekend. Review #14:I found it to be quite a rip-off. Nothing looked like the pictures the hotel website provided. Everything looked smaller. My room was supposed to be a non-smoking room but when I walked in, I smelled cigarettes. The staff tried to get rid of it by bringing in this ozone machine thing. The smell did go away but came back the next morning. That's when I realized that the smell came from the outside. Not only the smell penetrated the window so did the noise from car. However, there is one good thing about this room. It has a really nice gorgeous bathroom. Review #15:We stayed at the St. Sulpice from June 26 - 28. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Our deluxe suite had a sitting area with pull-out queen and a small bedroom with frosted french doors - this provided some but not complete privacy. The suite was appointed exactly as you would expect for a boutique hotel. It was perfect for our family of four including one teenager. Plenty of storage for clothes.The rooms were very clean and best of all very quiet - there was no noise from above, the street or the hallway - the room doors are recessed slightly and this may have helped. Our room faced St. Paul Street, which tended to be very quiet from 9 p.m. on and then into mid-morning. There was a building being renovated directly across the street so it did not make for the best view but overall was charming. The location is excellent. It is a block or so away from the very commercial and touristy section of St. Paul and you can easily walk to area restaurants and attractions. If you walk down St. Paul's in the opposite direction you come across more boutique type shops and less touristy places to eat along with art galleries. The breakfast was just so-so. Skip it and go to Claude Postel, one block away or Olive and Gourmando two blocks down St. Paul. The work-out room was small but suitable. The staff were very eager to assist and provided great service. The valet was very timely and pleasant. The front desk folks did give us a few vague directions and some incomplete information but otherwise were great. We attended an Alsace wine tasting in the garden - which was so pleasant - it is too bad they do not serve breakfast out there - it is also fun for an after dinner drink. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Review #16:My family and I recently visited the hotel and we were very disappointed at the quality of service of the hotel. This is our fifth visit to Old Montreal, we absolutely love the city and the sites. Upon our arrival to the hotel we approached the concierge to check in and was brushed off by one of the staff \"alain\" who told us to wait for his colleague to help us. He clearly was not busy but for some reason didn't have to time for us. The staff are not friendly, we have been to other hotels in Old Montreal and they are always smiling, saying hello and always willing to help and suggest places for us to go. When returning back to our rooms, none of the staff including the concierge would acknowledge us or even smile or say hello. The room was decent but not what you would expect for the price you pay. The sofa bed was absolutely terrible, the mattress was old and uncomfortable. The breakfast selection is poor to say the least. There are no eggs (extra charge), 5 slices of cold meats, small variety of fruit, cheese and toast. I've been to other hotels with a much better selection of french pastries, fruit, eggs, cheeses, etc. Upon checking out we were never asked about how we enjoyed our stay and were charged for items at breakfast without the staff telling us about it Overall we would never go back! What a shame especially for the ridiculous amount they charge. Review #17:Everything was fantastic during each of my stays or visits to this hotel ! I went there a dozen of times last year for business cocktails as well as for a birthday party in a suite of the hotel. I can sincerely say that I was impressed by their team, the location, the bar and the rooms ! Nothing to complain about, we were always in for quite an experience ! This boutique hotel is one of the finest in Montreal. In the heart of the Old Montreal, a few minutes away from the business center as well as the Port of Montreal, business men and families alike will find a great value. I definitely recommend it ! ! Review #18:We were extremely pleased with our stay at this hotel. We were travelling with our young child and the staff was fantastic at accommodating every need. We booked a superior room and it was HUGE and lovely - there was even a mini-kitchen with a microwave and 2 burner stovetop! One recommendation that I would make if booking this hotel, would be to make sure that you arrange for a room on the second floor or above, it's a very well travelled street and you would get a lot of noise at street level. We had an excellent experience and would stay there again in a heartbeat! Review #19:My husband and I traveled to Montreal in late April because he was attending a conference which was located at Saint-Sulpice Hotel. We decided to add a few extra days to explore Montreal since we had never been there before and spent six nights at Saint-Sulpice. We found that the hotel was in the perfect location in Old Montreal, literally around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica, about two blocks from a Metro station, and just off Rue Saint-Paul, which is the oldest and most charming street in Old Montreal. There were so many sights, shops, galleries and restaurants within easy walking distance. We were very pleased with this hotel. Our room was spacious with a kitchenette, living room, desk with wireless Internet, and a large bathroom with a shower and soaking tub. We also had a small balcony that overlooked a courtyard. Our bedroom was a separate, small room and I was surprised how quiet it was---we slept well. We were also at the end of the hallway, so we did not have many shared walls. The decor was more contemporary than traditional. My only complaint is that the carpet was a little bit worn and puckered in our room, but otherwise we were very pleased. A continental breakfast was included in our room. It was fine but nothing special, as continental breakfasts usually are. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel, although they have a nice courtyard cafe that would be enjoyable in warmer weather. We found the staff to be friendly and polite. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, particularly if your budget is less of a concern. Review #20:We had the good fortune to stay two nights this February while visiting family in Montreal. We loved the service provided by the door and desk staff that greeted us each time we came and went. The guest rooms are luxurious and very well appointed with comfortable furniture. Our room could sleep six with a murphy bed, pullout and queen bed in the bedroom. There was a kitchen for preparing light meals so we kept the beer and wine chilled and popped some popcorn one night snuggling in for a movie. I couldn't get over how sound proof the rooms are....I heard not a pipe,voice, or car muffler throughout our entire stay.... we had amazing sleeps. We loved visiting the church next door - and how close great restaurants, shops and people watching locals were. With everything we needed within walking distance, we parked the car upon arrival and left it in the garage until departure three days later. We'll be back in warmer weather to see much more of Old Montreal. Review #21:We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel--staff was helpful ! Room was comfortable. Good central location mid in the romantic old Montreal, close to great restaurants and easy to get around town. Concierge helpful in arranging side trips and restaurant recommendations. All in all a good stay Review #22:Just got back from a 5 day stay at Le Saint-Sulpice, and couldn't be happier with the hotel. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and it was wonderful to come back what is basically an apartment instead of a bedroom with a chair or two. The hotel is perfectly located in old Montreal down the block from Notre Dame and within a short walk of the downtown area. Breakfast was ample, it included fruit, cereal, yogurt, cheeses, croissants, sweet rolls, toast, nuts juices, and coffee or tea, if you wanted an American breakfast including eggs, bacon and potatoes it was $7.00 extra. We certainly enjoyed Montreal, there was a lot to do and the people there were exceptionally friendly. Review #23:We stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice for 6 nights with our 19 month old daughter. Having a toddler it was important to stay in a hotel with a separate bedroom as well as kitchen facilities. I would definately reccommend Le Saint-Sulpice for this! Great spacious, clean rooms with fabulous facilities. We got one with a terrace and had dinner outside most nights. The location of the hotel is also fantastic. Right in the old town of Montreal with cobbled streets, restaurants and a childrens playground at the old Port. There is also a fantastic childrens day nursery with spa facilities for parents about a 20 minute walk down Rue Notre Dame called Parentheses Montreal. A MUST for anyone with kids! The only dissappointment was the hotel restaurant where we had breakfast each morning. Since we stayed for 6 nights it shouldn't have been a surprise that we wanted a high-chair each morning but unfortunately we had to ask every day and they would have to go and fetch a usually soaking wet chair (left out in the rain all night!) which they would then dry and give to us for the baby. We would have to beg for coffee and butter for our toast - usually got it after about 3 requests. Also, the breakfast was the same for all 6 days! Not even a change of yoghurt choice or fruit.Not what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel. We also ordered room service (which comes from the hotel restaurant). We ordered chicken for our daughter which was undercooked when it arrived. Since she was so hungry we didnt send it back but microwaved it to ensure it was fully cooked. It was also overcharged on the room service bill. When we complainted to the restaurant manager he refused to belive it had been undercooked and said that the chicken they use sometimes looks rose coloured when cooked and then went into detailed explanations about their cooking techniques! For $22 I'd expect fully cooked chicken! In summary - fantastic hotel but avoid the restaurant. Review #24:Can't say anything negative, arrived at midnight, the girl at the front desk was happy and ready to check me in. I received an upgrade, the room was huge! the bed was so comfortable I nearly did not want to leave to go sightseeing! Great Location, walking distance to many shops, restaurants and smack bang in the middle of the old town. They price is actually well worth it, and you can't say that about many places these days! If I am ever back in Montreal I now know where to go! Review #25:Great hotel with very big rooms and an excellent location. If you stay anywhere in Montreal you want to stay in Old Montreal and Le Saint-Sulpice is an excellent choice. The staff was friendly, the room was very big with a separate bedroom, big bathroom and the hotel is in the middle of old Montreal. We would stay again. Review #26:We stayed here for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon in July. The suite was lovely - and huge as well. Very modern but yet comfortable, and the rest of the hotel was equally lovely. My husband made full use of the gym and thought is was better than a lot of hotel gyms but I have to say that the spa wasn't really worth that much of a look. This is a great place to stay for a weekend break and an ideal base for exploring the city. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Review #27:Excellent service with a real smile, at the desk, for breakfast and at the door. In the heart of old town Montreal, next to the Cathedral close to most restaurants. The rooms have a large bed and a good quality pullout for a family. The lofty shape is trendy, allows for light to enter the room, but does not have some level of privacy for a family. A kitchenette may be handy for some, but could have done without. Review #28:This is a lovely hotel in the Old Port, a great section of Montreal. An inviting and elegant lobby. Very easy access to Metro (you can get absolutely anywhere on the Metro), and close to many shops and restaurants. The Saint Sulpice has a very helpful staff who recommend places to eat, give great directions and are fairly quick to respond to requests. The only problem we had was our TV remote control didn't work (horrors!) and they never got around to replacing it. Great bathroom with separate shower and wonderful toiletries (L'Occitaine). One note is that, in our room, the shower had a frosted glass wall that was visible in the room, so if anyone was talking a shower, their silhouette was there for all to see. With small children it would be very embarrassing. For a couple traveling together, maybe not so embarrassing! Review #29:My husband and I just returned from an overnighter at Le Saint Sulpice and cannot say enough great things about it. We have already recommended it to all our friends. Our Loft Suite was very spacious, immaculate, wonderfully decorated with European simplicity and taste, and made for an awesome stay. The leather loveseat and chair were new and comfortable. The full kitchenette with refrigerator, stove and sink was great - we could not remember staying EVER at any hotel that included REAL glasses (water, cocktail AND wine glasses). What a treat. The queen bed with down comforter was scrumptious. The faux fireplace was a nice touch. The balcony would have been phenom if it had been summer! The bathroom was huge, with ceramic tile, a large soaking tub, large tile shower, and beautiful glass vanity. The toiletries and robes were also top notch. The staff was incredibly gracious, and we felt very pampered and taken care of - from the valet parking to the moment we left. The location is superb, right in the heart of old Montreal, and walking distance to all the great restaurants and the port. We will not consider staying anywhere else in Montreal, and will definitely be back again and again. Perhaps next time we will try massages at the Spa! Thanks to all the staff for our wonderful stay - and we can't wait to return! Review #30:We love to visit Old Montreal always something happening in this beautiful city. Our favourite hotel is Le Saint-Sulpice Suites, first class from the minute you pull the car up to the door. Valet service on arrival, smiling staff everywhere, fast check-in, bags arrived to our room in a flash and our one bedroom suite was spacious, comfortable and very cozy with a gas fireplace. Very clean and we appreciated the cooking facilities which we used for breakfast. Located close to the convention center we used the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153underground city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to walk uptown and do some shopping ok alot!.. :) Back at the hotel we went down to the bar for a cocktail before we headed out for supper, there are so many good restaurants just take your pick. We saw John Malkowich who was staying at the hotel for a movie production called Warm Bodies. Review #31:This hotel was lovely and very accommodating. It is located in Vieux Montreal which is a good tourist destination to stay in. The hotel is surrounded by art galleries, tourist shops, and restaurants which offer table d'hote meals where you can get an appetizer, entree, drink, and dessert for one price. Le Saint Sulpice is also by the water which is a nice area to stroll through. In addition, the hotel is located a few blocks from the Metro which can get you downtown. In my opinion, the only 2 places to stay in Montreal when visiting would be either the old town or downtown. The suite, I stayed in a deluxe suite, was nice and luxurious. My only complaint would be the size of the room for the bedroom which was a little small, but then again you're just sleeping in that room. Also, in the living room area, I had to stand up closer to the television for the remote control to work. I stayed on the first floor which was kinda strange since the outdoor dining service was outside my window. A white curtain blocked the inside view of my suite, but it was strange to not have the curtain opened most of the time. I enjoyed staying at this hotel despite the mediocre free breakfast which charged $4+ for hot food such as bacon and ham which weren't even cooked that well. The service is good though especially if you're only fluent in English, like myself. The staff was courteous and very helpful. Review #32:We recently traveled to Montreal on vacation with our teenager, and this hotel was recommended to us by friends who had stayed there previously. Although the room with our bed was quite tight, it was great to have a set up where our teenager could have her own space. The location can't be beat, the hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the continental breakfast included was good, although repetitive after 4 days. The croissants were outstanding, and breakfast is served in a nice outside courtyard. The concierge, bartender and desk staff were very helpful with directions and recommendations. When we checked in late at night, the person at the counter had not given us the correct amount of breakfast passes, suggesting that I speak with the manager in the morning. When I went to do so the next morning, the woman there had already been informed and had the breakfast passes ready for us. I didn't even have to go into explaining it. The location is in old Montreal, and the perfect location from which to explore the city. The only time we took our car out was to travel to La Ronde. I was so glad we had chosen to stay there, and have already started recommending it to anyone else traveling with a family to Montreal. We enjoyed staying here better than the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec (we had one room, not a suite there)! I only wish I had remembered to take the book which has all of the hotels in the group they belong to, of which all are suite hotels! Review #33:Great hotel, the rooms are spacious and furnished nicely. The hotel is not much for night life as for the bar, but everything is just a walk or metro ride away. Old Montreal is where it is located and it is awesome, lovely views and so many little places to walk into for coffee, dinner, or wine. The staff were helpful and eager to assist and were not looking for tips all the time. Typically we stay at Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton. This hotel is our choice for Montreal. People said the Murphy bed was not comfortable, but we slept perfect. Bathroom is large and plently of room for things on the counter and such. Nice touch also to have great huge windows that open for fresh air. Review #34:My husband and our friends spent New Years weekend here and I must say I do not see why everyone is giving this hotel such good reviews. Yes the rooms are nice and spacious, but that is the only thing that is nice about this place. The food was not good, it was not fresh, and tasted as if it was sitting out for hours before it was brought out to our table. The service was not the service of a 4star hotel. We had a mix-up with our suites, and were told that one of them was canceled; we did not get any apologies and were told that if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have cancellations we would just have to deal with it and share one suite, which was okay considering they gave us an upgrade to a bigger room, but they did not give us any extra towels, toiletries, or pillows needed for four people\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6even after I called and requested it, it was still never sent to us. My overall experience was not a positive one therefore I would not be coming back to this hotel. However, you get what you pay for and this hotel was not at all expansive considering the room size and the hotel location, plus they give you free breakfast, which was not bad. Another thing the hotel needs is a lounge or a bar, they have about five chairs at the restaurant bar. which is not sufficient for a hotel this size, and a little shop where guests can get things like coffe, soda. or meds without having to leave the hotel. Review #35:Perhaps we'd been spoilt by the fabulous Auberge Saint Aintoine in Quebec City, but the Saint Sulpice was a little bit of a disappointment. It's location is excellent, but the room we were given (which we subsequently discovered to be one of the smallest in the hotel) was hardly the \"loft siuite\" it claimed to be. In fact it was not a suite at all - just one room - and given that the TV was opposite the bed rather than the sofa you couldn't even pretend it was a suite. The bed itself folded down from the wall, which wasn't in itself much of a problem (other than having to clamber in over a large frame) but it was rather bizarre. However, our biggest gripe was the restaurant where almost unbelievably they allow smoking in all areas - I was just amazed by this. Also, they short-changed me on both occasions we ate there; once could be a mistake, but twice... Perhaps I'm being fussy but I expect better at these prices. Review #36:My wife and I -- 2 middle class Americans with modest travel experience -- recently stayed here for a long weekend. We were attracted by the outside courtyard and the many excellent reviews. We were not disappointed. We were treated superbly by all staff members, the hotel is beautiful and unique, and the courtyard is a terrific place to enjoy a bottle of wine, a glass of beer, a Cuban cigar, whatever. The hotel is a great mix of the old and the contemporary, and we really loved just laying around the room. Some people suggest Claude Postel for breakfast -- be aware that they have moved and I am not certain it is the right choice unless you are looking for pastries. Our friends gushed about Bonapartes for lunch but we went for dinner and found the place staid. So lunch would be the better choice and we do trust their call. Perhaps the true highlight of the trip was our dinner at Ferreira's, a Portuguese place. Pricey but worth every penny. I started with grilled octopus and went for the fruits de mer -- wow! and I am not even a big fish eater. My wife had a salted blackened cod -- again, blew us away. The staff was great and the ambiance upscale hip but not pretentious or uncomfortable in any way. (We are not hip or upscale!) If you are looking for solid bistro food near the hotel, we liked Holder's. Also contemporary. Not fabulous, but an enjoyable experience and very convenient to the hotel's location. If you are ever thinking you deserve a splurge, this may well be the place. Review #37:I was disappointed after reading the tripadvisor reviews because I was expecting something out of this world. This is a nice high end hotel. Things were clean, things looked pretty, and things were safe. It was nice. It wasnt cozy or unique or romantic. The bathroom had a walk in shower and a tub which we liked. The bedroom was set apart from the living room which would be nice for parents so they could close the doors while the kids sleep in the living room I suppose. There was a mini kitchen area where we made breakfast. The concierge downstairs helped us decide where to go to dinner and made reservations. All in all, it was a nice high end hotel. It was quite large so it did not feel initimate but it was nice. The location is nice as it is right around the corner from Notre Dame and across the street from a cupcake shop and a tea shop. There were a few restaurants walking distance. Would work well for business travel as well. Review #38:Arrived on 11/23, late in the day (for me) and tired. First room they had us checked into had red carpet stains. Second room they put us in was on ground floor right next to outside terrace. Murphy bed was lowered by staff so didn't notice the dried orange fluid (orange juice/vomit?) on the frame of the murphy bed until the next morning. Yuck! Place is nice but not spectacular, for the amt of $, if you can get another hotel w/a WARM breakfast take it. Their breakfast is a choice of 3 cereals, 3 types of cold pastries, dried fruit and yogurt). The concierges: Maxim, Etienne and Alan were very informative. Housekeeper Guadalupe was very sweet. Overall nice stay, but not something to rage about. Next time, I'll try a different place. Definitely recommend you check out the room, even under the sheets, before accepting it. Also, on the Friday nite that we were there the downstairs bar hosted a very loud party which went on until the wee morning hours. I was awoken at 4 am by people smoking and laughing loudly in the outside terrace. If business travel is what you are after, you may want to opt for a quieter place. Although the staff were very apologetic to the hotel guests the next morning, that wasn't going to replace the sleep everyone had lost the nite before. It should be noted that the entire hotel only has ONE pc for internet access and it's in the lobby next to the valet, no privacy and sometimes you have to queue up to use it. Last note: The murphy bed is located next to the kitchenette. I am a light sleeper and was awoken on the 2nd nite by a dripping noise that resembled Chinese torture. I turned on the fan to muffle the sound and woke up with a sore throat the next day. I couldn't locate the origin of the drops, but definitely don't stay in room #120 if you're a light sleeper. Review #39:We recently hosted our daughter's wedding in the garden at the Saint-Sulpice. The staff was extremely efficient as we planned this out of town event: the event coordinator was especially enthusiastic and detailed. We were not disappointed: the rooms are spacious and comfortable and have great provisions for a family: we especially liked the espresso machine on our bar. Continental buffet breakfast is included in the cost of the room: fresh fruit and excellent croissant. The dining room was ours for the event, and the meal was of the highest calibre. the location is smack in the middle of Old Montreal - take advantage of the valet parking. Our entire party had only positive things to say about this location. Review #40:I spent just two nights here on a road trip which started in New York. Large room and living area, very clean, well laid out, comfy bed, good location, friendly staff. Whatever the wifi problem was that other reviewers mentioned, the hotel have come good on resolving as it worked fine from everywhere anywhere near the hotel. Overall I was really happy with my choice of hotel in Montreal. Nothing not to like here. Review #41:For an 18th birthday/graduation present I decided to take my sister to Montreal for a long weekend. After hours of research I decided to go with this hotel due to the outstanding reviews that it got. I've stayed in many hotels all over the world and I've never been as disapointed with a hotel. The service was HORRIBLE. Right after the valet parked my car I realized that I forgot some things in it. When I approached one of the valets about it he rolled his eyes and sighed. Not called for! The next morning I couldn't find the tickets for my breakfast, which was included.. When I explained it to the girl that was working she was extremely rude and talked down to me about the situation. I also have severe allergies, which I communicated to the hotel before I got there and when we checked in. There was one really nice girl at the front desk, I wish I could remember what her name was.. Long story short.. My needs were ignored and I got blamed for the situation. Most of the staff weren't very understanding or very friendly. It is in a great location though. Review #42:We stayed for two nights and loved our room! The hotel was sophisticated, and luxurious. My partner and I are a younger couple and we were treated with the highest level of respect. The front desk staff recommended a wonderful restaurant within walking distance, and were helpful in answering all of our questions. We would definitelyu stay here again. The close location to subway services made moving around the city in the nasty cold Quebec winter tolerable! Next time we will visit in the summer so we can enjoy more of this beautiful city. Review #43:My wife and I had 2 stays here over a 2 week period on a trip that began and ended in Montreal. The staff and the location are fantastic. The rooms are beautifully appointed albeit with some questionable furniture pieces. Staying in 2 different rooms gave us a better perspective of things as they have used the same funiture to address different room configurations. We actually had 2 tvs in the second room - #614 which I highly recommend. Facing the inner courtyard is a good idea as it is very quiet in spite of the ambient noise of the air conditioning exhaust. Facing St Paul St can be a very noisy experience. The balconies are small but serviceable. A really nice touch is the L'Ocitanne toiletries that are provided as well as the complementry bottled water that is delivered every evening. The Chateau Frontenac in Quebec was charging $8 for a bottle in the room. Some other reviews have been critical of the continental breakfast but we found it quite good and it is complementry. There is a breakfast menu for those wanting a full breakfast. The concierges were really helpful, courteous and well informed, as were the rest of the front desk staff. The valet staff were also first class and the car came quickly when requested. The bang for the buck in this hotel is outstanding, I have already booked it for a business trip in August. Review #44:We recently spent two nights at the Saint Sulpice. The hotel is located in Old Montreal so we could walk everywhere. We had a three room suite (BR, LR/Kitchenette and Bath) that was like having our own apartment. There is a real neighborhood feel to the area and we were right around the corner from the Notre Dame Basilica. There are many restaurants in the area, plus we found a grocery store and a pharmacy within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful and the service excellent. We plan to return to Montreal and will stay in the Saint-Sulpice. Review #45:I recently returned from Montreal after honeymooning for about a week at Le Saint Sulpice. The hotel was magnificent! My husband called in advance of our trip to request an early check-in, and we were able to get into our room upon arrival. We had a deluxe suite on the 4th floor that faced the courtyard. The bathroom was very nice with a large bathtub and huge shower. The bedroom was small, but very cozy and romantic. The bed was amazingly comfortable. We also had a fireplace and a lovely balcony. I highly recommend a balcony. I spent a lot of time sipping my morning coffee and evening wine while watching the activity in the courtyard. On another note, continental breakfast was included with our rate and available in the restaurant until 11:00 AM. And, nightly turn-down service was provided. Le Saint Sulpice is perfectly located in the heart of Vieux Montreal. Highlights located nearby include the museum Pointe-\u00c3\u00a0-Calli\u00c3\u00a8re, the bar at the Hotel Place d'Armes, and the restaurant Le Club Chasse et Peche. Make sure to escape the tourists, though, and head to other areas of town. We had great bagels in Montreal's Mile-End neighborhood and smoked meat sandwiches at Schwartz's on St. Laurent. For a fabulous brewpub, go to Dieu du Ciel on Laurier Ave. For sushi, go to Jun I, also on Laurier. The English area of town around Crescent Street is also worth checking out. We bar hopped starting at the Winston Churchill Pub . For a clubby, Manhattan-ish experience, go to Cavalli on Peel. For you gamblers, spend an evening at the massive Casino de Montreal. We won! Review #46:In the heart of old Montreal. Close to shopping, dining, sight seeing and the Metro. Makes for an idle base of operations. Rooms are clean, well appointed and functional. Contain all the amentities you need, included a small kitchen area. The staff was there to assist, and the conceirge efficiently took care of dinner reservations landing us a table at the difficult to visit Au Pied De Cochon. A wonderful stay, hope to return. Review #47:just returned from a fabulous weekend in montreal with my hubby...the hotel was superb...the lotus flower fragrance upon entering the lobby was incredible...the location perfect...the linens sublime...the sound of the church bells from our open courtyard window heavenly...i want to go back!!! we'd stay here again that's for sure! Review #48:Picked the hotel after finding a good on line deal and reading strong reviews from other travelers. I didnt see any issues with carpeting or age of the rooms as others had noted. I think we got a recently renovated room. Room was great, concierge (Ettien?) was excellent he reall understood what we were looking for in restaurants and shopping, and the location cant be beat. My only issue would be that we were on the first floor facing the street so our room was a bit noisy and we couldnt not open our curtains. Otherwise great boutique hotel.. Review #49:Overall, we couldn't have asked for more from Le Saint-Sulpice. The room was spacious, clean, and had all the modern amenities...stove, sink, separate living room and bedroom (each with a television), large tiled shower and sepate bath. We had two dogs with us and the staff provided great service. We were welcomed curbside by the friendliest of gents who was super with the pets and provided us with all the information that we needed. Having dogs is always tricky when traveling, but again, the staff was exceptionally accomodating. When we inquired about the best local restaurants, the staff was honest (and not pushing their own place) and guided us well. Right in the heart of old Montreal....close to the water and walking distance to everything. Courtyard-side was worth the small extra charge. The dog-friendly room was out of the way of the rest of the patrons which allowed us to take them in and out without bothering others, but quality of the room wasn't compromised because of the dog's presence. Loved the staff, loved the location, loved the room. Great place! Review #50:We have just returned from a lovely stay at this Hotel. It is centrally located , walking distance to everything. Science Center , Imax theater, waterfront, parks, Shops, restaurants, and around the corner The Notre-Dame Basilica. The Basilica has a wonderful light -sound and history show at night this is a very nice way to see the church. Our 12 year old daughter loved it! The hotel has everything to offer, outdoor patio seating and another restaurant down stairs This is where they serve breakfast. Our room was huge, large living room with kitchenette, pull out couch. French door opening out to patio. plenty of closet space. Great bathroom ,shower and soaking tub glass sinks, robes and plenty of L'Occitane products. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. We needed to get our car out to go to the Boidome area and it took less than 10 mins. This Hotel has a small gym upstairs and a spa. I didn't have time to use either. The other thing that this Hotel has to offer being in old Montreal most buildings have steps. Saint-Sulpice is totally handicapped accessible. They offer accessible rooms with showers, there is a ramp in the lobby, no steps to get into Hotel, and an elevator. I would reccommend this Hotel to everyone, Because of the great location, accessibility, and friendly staff and service. Review #51:One of the best experiences I've had with a hotel. The location is great, every staff person I encountered was friendly, and incredibly helpful. The room was bigger than we imagined, clean, and pretty luxurious (large deep tub, gas fireplace, Nespresso maker, two TVs, great bed, etc...) And on top of all this, they welcome dogs. No \"dog smell\" in the room, no attitude from staff or other customers, very accommodating in terms of cleaning the room when we were out with our dog. This will be where I always stay. Oh, and there's free breakfast. Review #52:Loved this place!! Not sure if all rooms are suites, but ours was--two sets of windows opening onto lovely courtyard, complete with a wedding ceremony/reception to watch on our first evening with our fellow third floor residents. While not the full balcony we had hoped for, the windows opened enough so that it felt like it. One night we had a torrential downpour, and it was so romantic to open up the windows, lean on the rail, and watch the lightning and listen to the rain fall while staying dry... Water was delivered daily, the doormen and concierge were always attentive, every amenity was available, and the accupressure massage in the spa was, put simply, the best I've ever had. If they had an open appointment, we would have gotten a pedicure as well. You cannot beat the location--the waterfront two blocks away, all of the old city at your doorstep, the metro within 200 yards. (Only two suggestions: higher thread count sheets would be nice, and staff need to give more precise directions to restaurants. We missed a reservation because we hunted for the place we were sent without success, even with the map.) The price was right, and I have been raving about all the St. Sulpice since I got home. Thanks for a memorable 20th anniversary! ! Review #53:My Fiance and I stayed here to celebrate our engagement in December 2011. We greatly enjoyed our stay. Excellent location allowed us to leave our car with their valet and walk throughout much of the Old Port as well is only a 5-10 minute walk from the nearest metro station which allows quick access to the rest of the City. We stated in a Deluxe Suite which did not disappoint, a great balcony, wonderful fire place (which we used daily) a large bathroom and a small en suite kitchen which was wonderful for preparing snacks and drinks throughout our stay. The Staff were all lovely and very welcoming and the golden key concierege lived up to their reputation arranging anything and everything we requested. We had drinks in the Sinclair lounge several nights and really enjoyed the bartenders there, they encouraged us to try Sortil\u00c3\u00a8ge - a locally made whiskey infused with maple syrup - this did not disappoint and we left Montreal with several bottles to stock our bar at home. All in all our trip was a complete success thanks to the wonderful staff and beautiful hotel. Review #54:We stayed at the Saint-Sulpice hotel two weeks ago and it was just amazing! Our room was really spacious, the furniture is stylish and the staff is very professional. The hotel is located in the old montreal and is next to almost all interesting spots. I definitely recommend this hotel and will come back for sure! Review #55:My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in August. The hotel staff were always friendly and accomodating and answered all our questions. The room was wonderful -- tons of room, comfortable seating, nice view of the street. I wasn't too keen on the bed -- it was rather too firm for my taste, but I didn't really expect anything different. My only complaint would be about the maid service. While they do way more than I would expect (like washing the dishes we used from the kitchenette), it was a constant battle to keep our toilet paper and tissues replenished. We finally left a good tip for housekeeping and got some toilet paper. I almost think this is housekeepings way of getting back at the people staying in hotels (this seems to happen more often than not, and not just at this hotel). The rooms were clean, linens fresh, many extras available that normally aren't at other hotels, and the room service was superb! Review #56:I stay at the Saint Sulpice 2/3 times per year when in Montreal for business meetings. After the renovation works of last year, it was clear to me that imporvements have continued at the hotel. Staff was extremely nice, as usual; excellent service; location is right in the heart of old Montreal. I personally didn't like too much the new d\u00c3\u00a9co of the restaurant and especially the acustic... We happened to be there a day while a big group of probably 50-60 people from a conference were having lunch and it was impossible to listen what we were saying. Also somewhat disappointing was the fact that the minibar was empty, with just a bottle of wine in it. I know this could be used for own grocery, but when travelling for business and after a long day I find quite nice to have a drink without needing to call the room service! Beside that, I was again quite satisfied and will certainly return. Review #57:Stayed here for two nights this weekend. The location is superb - right in the heart of old Montreal. The staff are wonderful - they greet you by name once you've registered, the valet parking is quick and efficient, the registration staff lovely. The hotel lobby is tastefully decorated and comfortable. I had stayed here twice before years ago and loved the room. The room this time seemed to be missing something. The furniture was quite scratched and there was a blank wall with extension cords going to lamps - it looks like there should be a chair or table or something to furnish the wall. I don't think we had a queen sized bed but it was very comfy - with a big duvet. The bathroom is terrific - big, modern, clean. Having a little kitchen counter, glasses, bottle opener was great. We had a complementary breakfast in Sinclairs and had invited friends to join us. The continental breakfast buffet is very good - lovely little croissants and pains au chocolat, fruit, cereal. My husband ordered \u00c3\u00a0 la carte and said the eggs, sausage, beans, potatoes were not great. Review #58:We stayed here the night after we got married. We were upgraded to a suite which was very nice. The hotel does have some quirks, but for a very old building in the heart of Montreal it is very nice. The rooms are clean, bright and comfortable. We had a coffee machine in our room which was nice and the breakfast was excellent. My only complaint is having to hand over your car keys when arriving to the door man. Overall an excellent hotel with lots of character. Review #59:We were two adults and one 13 year old and we all thought the room was one of the best hotels we had EVER stayed at. we were there on a thursday so our rate was also excellent. Right in the heart of old Montreal, two blocks from Science center. Thanks St-sulpice! Review #60:Le Saint-Sulpice is located in Old Montreal - a great location for walking to Chinatown, several museums, and the Quays of the Old Ports of Montreal. The hotel is small, and our room was perfect for our stay. We had a refrigerator, sink, dishes, and stove top. The hotel's stay includes a breakfast in the hotel's dining room. It includes breads, muffins, cereal, tons of fruit, great coffee, juice, and ambiance. If you want eggs, you will pay an additional $10. We stayed one week, and on the last night, a maid walked in our room with a huge bottle of water. We were leaving the next morning via plane, so we left the bottle. I'm not sure why we didn't get that water during our stay. One oddity was that we asked the front desk to call a taxi for us to leave at 5 AM for the airport. When we got downstairs, there was no taxi, so my husband walked to the end of the block and flagged one down. The main valet kept apologizing. Odd - Review #61:First off all, I don't know why the other reviews talk down about the Murphy Bed. It was just a trendy furniture with a real mattress. I've stayed previously with my girlfriend in a Deluxe closed bedroom last time and I can assure you that it is the same mattress and firmness with a tad of heavenly soft on the top. Now to the good stuff. As it was our second stay, we knew very well where we were going. The hotel is super well located in the heart of Old Montreal behind the Notre-Dame Basilica which is holding an Exhibition on the artifacts of the Vatican's museum. You should go and have a look. WOW! The staff as usual was very pleasant and helpful. Some of them even recognized us from a year before. I took the time to remember some of the names of many good employees such as Michael, Rafal, Dave, Luis and the lovely Anthea. Although we had been here before, we made sure to look for the Chef Concierge Patrick who had given us great restaurant recommendations last time. He gave us the 411 on what was happening and the new restaurants we should try out and the new whereabouts for shopping. Wow! Once again he didn't fell us and sent us to great eating places (Club Chasse et Peche, Version Laurent Godbout, Europea and Boris Bistro). Last but not least, we had been referred by Julien to try out the lunch on the MAGNIFICENT terrasse in the back. They have this hidden garden located in the back of the hotel and the kitchen cooks BBQ grilled meat and vegetables outside in front of you. Food was delicious and the service way up there just like the hotel. I took time to remember two fantastic waiters, Bojan and Etiene I think. In sum, all I can say is that becoming the best is easy but staying the best is the hardest part and all of you at the St-Sulpice seemed to know what it takes to stay on TOP. Great job and keep it up! Review #62:My mother and I stayed at this hotel and we thought it was fabulous. The way the rooms are set up - like small suites - was just wonderful for a vacation. It was as if we each had our own room, for the price of one. If one of us wanted to stay up late or get up early it wasn't a problem. One night we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. Frankly, we were just expecting mediocre \"hotel food.\" But we were delighted at the meal and agree that, for both of us, it was one of the best restaurant meals we had ever had. And for two foodies from Chicago, that's pretty good. The concierge was great. I left my sweater in a taxi and they scoured the city and found it. Wonderful! Review #63:We stayed at the Le Saint Sulpice for a long weekend the week before Christmas. The hotel was one of the highlights of the trip! The room was quite spacious, well decorated and very clean. The large living room, bedroom and bathrooms were all separate giving it a \"home\" feel. We even had a kitchenette. The balcony view of the back of the Notre Dame cathedral was very nice. The location was fine as well, we were right in the heart of Old Montreal. The service was great: we were expecting a little snotiness because are Americans but there was none of that. The staff was courteous and very helpful. The best part of our stay there was coming home at night and lighting a fire in the fireplace- it was just what we needed after a long day out in the cold. We will definitely stay at the Le Saint Sulpice on our next rip to Montreal. Review #64:My husband and daughter (age 14) spent two nights at the Hotel St. Sulpice in Montreal. The hotel is located in Old Montreal and very close to the Cathedral. We chose the hotel because it offered a suite with an enclosed bedroom so we could have privacy. We were delighted with the tastefully decorated room, comfortable bed & comfortable enough pullout sofa; with the quaint balcony, and extremely professional service at the front desk. We also received free breakfast for 2 each morning and that was delicious too. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. Another plus, the hotel lobby had a subtle but nice fragrance - verbena, I think. Really nice. This hotel would be equally good for business travelers, families with older children and friends on a weekend shopping/cultural trip. You can walk to the shops and restaurants of Old Montreal. Did I miss anything? Go there!! The cathedral \"light show was kinda, okay very, hokey but still informative. Don't get me started on the bus tour....skip that. Review #65:Company corporate rate caused me to stay there many times over the past 2 years. Have found it uneven in service and cleanliness. Often there is no one at the desk at night or they're understaffed. Room and laundry service are hit or miss. Even tried to make up for past troubles (lost my laundry for a day) by giving me a special edible treat, which turned out to be spoiled! Rooms are soulless, and have found the previous guests garbage or crusty washcloth still in the room upon arrival on more than one occasion. There are many better places in Montreal. Review #66:Just returned from a wonderful 5 day trip to the city of Montreal and a very satisfying stay at the Hotel Le Saint Sulpice in the Vieux Montreal section of the city. We arrived late on a Thursday and were given an upgrade to an exec. suite which was roomy and comfortable w/ a fireplace and a spacious deck. All the rooms are suites of varying size so I wouldn't want to mislead anyone but as I said this room was ideal. My wife enjoyed a 1 1/2 hr massage in their spa which is not luxe but nonetheless clean and comfortable. There's that word again. All told the hotel is very well located, the staff extremely friendly and helpful, and we would return to the Saint Sulpice in an instant. Review #67:This is a great apartment hotel in Old Montreal. The room was spacious and comfortable with a really luxurious bathroom. Tthe public areas were very stylish, except for the restaurant which was a bit dark and severe for breakfast. However, the thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff - they seem to genuinely enjoy working there, which made it a pleasure to stay there. When the wireless connection in our room didn't work, four people arrived, one after the other, to sort the problem out till it was fixed. The location is great for sightseeing, although many of the restaurants nearby are touristy and mediocre. Montreal `grew' on us as a city and if we returned we would be delighted to stay at St Sulpice again. Review #68:My husband and I were looking for a weekend get a way and the Saint-Sulpice was a perfect destination. We stayed for two nights and took advantage of their package which included two passes to the Scandinavian Spa. The spa was only a block away and heavenly. Although we had a rainy weekend, our deluxe suite was very comfortable and inviting with a fireplace and balcony over looking Old Montreal. All of the staff we encountered were very helpful but I cannot say enough about the Concierge. His recommendations were exactly what we were looking for in terms of restaurants, walking routes and entertainment. We were also very impressed with the selection and scope of the continental breakfast. Don't forget to try the croissants! We would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Montreal. Enjoy! Review #69:This was my second trip to Montreal, and my second stay at St Sulpice. I absolutely love this hotel. The service is top notch staff is friendly and helpful. I paid the additional nightly fee for a suite to avoid the Murphy bed. To me, it's worth the $20 or so extra per night to have so much additional space and a comfortable bed. We had another lovely suite- this time with a fireplace. The bathroom was larger than our suite from last year- we had a double sink and did not have the frosted glass btwn the bath & bedroom. Only disappointment in this layout was that the bedroom did not have a dressing table. However, we did have a larger living room. I love that they remember little details- like the personalized business cards upon check in, the nightly bottled water, and the card showing the weather forecast for the next day. I've read reviews here before about the free breakfast- once again I didn't try the breakfast. There is a fabulous pastry shop about four doors down on Notre Dame called Claude Postel. Drag yourself out of bed and spend the money you would have spent tipping the waitstaff for the free hotel breakfast at Claude Postel. It's worth it! Even in the bitter cold!! As long as CP is open, I don't think I will ever eat the hotel breakfast. We ate dinner on our last night at the S Restaurant in the hotel. The food was tasty, but not very adventurous, and was more expensive than some of the delicious meals we had during the weekend. It was what I expeceted food to be at a hotel of this calibur. Spa staff was great, front desk staff was very helpful, valet was prompt with our car, room was clean and neat. Another wonderful stay at this hotel- can't wait to return! Review #70:Took the TripAdvisor recommendations on board and booked a stay at this hotel using Expedia. Got a great rate which made the stay even better. Friendly front desk staff and concierges. The room was really good, a big bath suitable for two and a separate stand up shower. Nice comfy bed and separate living room with TV - windows overlooked yard. The bonus was having a very well equipped kitchenette too. Great for making sandwiches and snacks for our trips out of the city. The fridge had plenty of room for our food too. Plenty of cutlery, plates, bowls and a microwave. The rooms in this hotel were as good as any European hotel I have stayed in. Now what could be better? The lighting in the living area was a bit too subdued and akward to control centrally. The glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom could distrub someone sleeping if someone else used the bathroom at night. The restaurant and breakfasts were really good with excellent service. However, some tables close to the restaurant entrance seemed to have lots of flies when we were there on several hot August days - not a serious problem but the staff could do with managing it. We went out to the rear garden restaurant one evening for a drink and it too was very dark and service was a bit slow. Car parking is extra but you are in the middle of Old or Vieux Montreal. Cab s arrived promptly on request and the local Metro station is 5-6 mins walk away giving easy access to other parts of the city. Highly recommended and I will have no hesitation in staying there on future visits to Montreal - way better than one of those 80s / 90s chain hotels that claim to be 4 or 5 star. Review #71:I stayed here over the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays. The hotel is in an outstanding location, directly behind Notre Dame and steps away from the shops and restaurants of Rue St. Paul. The room was fairly large, and included a small kitchenette. The bathroom was spacious, and had a separate (large) tub and walk-in shower. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff were polite and helpful. There isn't a gym inside the hotel; but they have access to a very small facility about one block away. There is free wifi in the hotel, but it was pretty slow. Review #72:A great hotel! As previous reviews mentioned; excellent service was housed here and all the staff that we interacted with were polite, smiling and helpful. The room was a deluxe suite (#216). Very nice size, bedroom was great and the bathroom was extremely comfy. The room also had a kitchenette, with pots, and dishes provided if you really want to cook. Two tv's in the room; one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area. The negatives were bad food via room service (just luke warm and bland) and albeit still a nice bathroom the tiles were starting to get warn. All that aside and you have still have a great hotel in Old Montreal. Approx. 5 min walk to the Metro (Notre Dame station), liquor store near by (1min away), and lots of great restuarants. Don't go to Eggspectations across from the Cathedral...its average food and packed with tourists. Try a little cafe or restaurant within Old Montreal. Ask the concierge. Enjoy. Review #73:My husband and I had to travel to Montreal on business and within minutes of our arrival, took the smiling suggestion of the reservations desk and extended our stay to two nights. The hotel is lovely - shares one (or more) of it's walls with Notre Dame cathedral, yet is very contemporary, solid (read as \"thick\" walls so we found it very quiet!) and immaculate. We selected Saint Sulpice based on location, ability to bring our small dog, and cost - and it didn't fail our expectations on any front. It was convenient to include our dachsund in our plans (very much worth the extra $50 deposit to have her with us rather than kennel her) and the exceptional staff had all three of us feeling more than welcome. Kudos to the concierge/front desk recommendations - we were steered right with every request for the where-to-eats and what-to-sees! I strongly agree with the former reviewer's commendation about the valets. They parked our oversized van right next to the hotel - safely and without complaint - quick to call our room when they were uncertain as to how to lock the side cabinets for us. I loved our spacious room and small deck. Just behind the hotel is a perfect grassy spot to walk the dog (bring baggies! The lawn and little garden is well-kept). We found the down-filled bedding very comfortable, so our mattress was clearly not the same as the former reviewer's. Our only complaint became a little joke between my husband and I - that the towels are far from soft. We laughingly called our drying off \"The Exfoliation\"! This hotel far exceeded our expectations - especially when it came to service. We'd return - wouldn't stay elsewhere in Montreal - if it weren't for the seven hour drive. Review #74:We've stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice several times and have always enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located in the heart of Old Montreal just behind the Notre Dame Cathedral. The lobby of the hotel is warmly decorated and includes a cozy sitting area around a large fireplace. Through the lobby is a beautiful courtyard restaurant under white canopy. We've eaten at the restaurant a few times and have found the food and service somewhat hit and miss. Overall acceptable though. The rooms are beautifully decorated with dark wood accents and modern decor. Some have electric fireplaces and some have small balconies. The rooms tend to be somewhat narrow but still provide a comfortable stay. Review #75:We were extremely happy with the Hotel until we went for breakfast on Sunday Morning. My wife and I had the buffet The buffet was much to expensive for what was offered. The bananas were over ripe and the fruit was hard. We were very disappointed that we ate there. It spoiled our weekend. Review #76:My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Le Saint--Sulpice very much. It 's in an ideal location just behind the Notre-Dame Basilica and just a five minute walk to the nearest Metro station (Place-d'Armes) or bus stop. We enjoyed that the rooms have a little kitchenette as the first day we went to the Jean Talon Market to buy salami, baguette, cheese, fresh fruits, and wine. The room came equipped with everything we needed to have an enjoyable dinner in front of the fireplace (dishes, utensils, wine glasses, etc--they even have microwave, refrigerator, and two burner stove). The included continental breakfast was great as well and we had good service each morning. Otherwise, we didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but we did have some enjoyable meals just a few minutes walk from the hotel (Resident, Olive and Gourmando, Europea Espace). When we first arrived, our toilet made a loud leaking noise every five minutes, so we called down and a service man was in our room within a few minutes. He was very friendly and helpful and did his best to fix it. After he left, it started leaking maybe every 10 minutes, but we weren't going to complain about it. When we got back to our room from dinner that night we realized that it was no longer leaking. We assume that the service man came back to our room to fix it when we weren't there because it was fine for the remainder of our stay. If management is reading this--we are very appreciative of his help! The only reason I'm not giving St. Sulpice the full five stars is, while still nice, the rooms could stand for new carpet and paint and possibly new televisions. Also, the first towel I picked up had some long strands of hair stuck to it, which made me hesitant about the cleanliness of the hotel, but that was my only negative experience. Review #77:Our son and daughter-in-law arranged a 50th wedding anniversary celebration at the hotel. The staff was uniformly helpful and gracious. There were 18 of us (including children) and when we checked in the concierge welcomed us personally and wished us happy anniversary. We were extraordinarily fortunate and the weather was warm and sunny the whole weekend. We were able to have our before dinner drinks and canapes on the terrace. The celebration dinner at the hotel was excellent. Each evening bottled water was placed next to the beds - something one never gets even at the most upscale hotels in Europe. I have a theory that there is a correlation between the quality of hotels and towels: the towels were wonderful. The continental breakfast was fine although it would have been nice to have had rolls as a choice. Some of our party ordered cooked breakfasts which looked quite nice. One afternoon some of us had lunch on the terrace. Although service was slow, the food was good. Our one caveat: there is deferred maintenance and the carpets in the room should be replaced as should some of the couches, especially in our daughter's room. Our room, though, was perfect as we had been upgraded. The location in the heart of Old Montreal, near restaurants and the waterfront, was superb. If we ever returned to Montreal there is no question we would stay at this hotel. Review #78:We recently returned from Montreal and wanted to share a wonderful experience at Le Saint Sulpice....comfortable and clean, elegant and attentive to detail. The one bedroom suite was ample and beds comfortable, even the Murphy bed. The staff was responsive and eager to help make our stay memorable. Concierge was excellent. Highly recommend this hotel and will certainly return. Review #79:I chose the word Golden because for me it means something that last forever or memorable. Sometimes it hard to imagine that you can find in a small hotel the same quality of service that you expect in one big five-star hotel. Le Saint Sulpice is a small place but well located in the beautiful old part of Montreal. At the courtyard I think they have one of the coziest garden that I've seen in the area. Pleasant place to welcome friends or a special person. And regarding the service, what could I say as they have two Clefs d'Or Concierges there just for you! No doubt that those two Golden Keys holders helped me enjoy the most of the city and then leave there with that memorable experience! Review #80:This is a fantastic hotel. Admittedly we had the most expensive suite (but it's an all-suite hotel so each one should be spacious) but the place was fantastic, everyone was helpful and friendly (NOT a given in Montreal believe me) and they even rang to say we'd left something in the room and did we want them to post it back. Review #81:Great location in the midst of Old Montreal. The highlights of the hotel were: nicely appointed clean room, quiet location, short distance to Metro stop, better than average gym and access to many good restaurants within a few blocks of hotel. Disappointed to find out that if you book with Expedia your room will not include breakfast which apparently is included for most other types of reservations. In this situation consider saving a bundle of money by eating breakfast in one of several cafes just around the corner. Also, conceige was helpful with directions but restaurant recommmendations were no better than our random selections. Review #82:A super \"boutique\" hotel in the old part of Montreal.. Very good service. Good size bathrooms. Free high speed Internet.. Superb restaurant in the hotel courtyard.. Before leaving Montreal and out of curiosity, I went to vist 4 other boutique hotels as well in old part of Montreal, and the Saint Suplice hotel is the best !! Definitively I will stay again at the Saint Sukpice, during my next trips to Montreal. Many excellent restaurants nearby. For indian food lovers, try the excellent GANDHi restaurant nearby. Review #83:Very beautiful hotel with huge and comfortable rooms (my room was composed by: bath, bedroom, little kitchen, hall with fireplace). The breakfast is served in a nice covered garden. I was here for a business trip and the convention center of the hotel was convenient. The hotel is situated in a strategic position in the old Montreal and near the city centre. Review #84:We had the pleasure of travelling to Montreal for the weekend and stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice. We had researched different hotels to stay at and chose this one based on the location and reputation it presented. We were amazed at the beauty of the hotel with the gardens and fresh scent as we walked in to the hotel. We were greated with a smile and were treated like royalty throughout the weekend. Our rooms were adjoined, as we were seven women travelling together for a girl's weekend pleasure trip. The rooms were large, beautiful and perfect for our needs. We really cannot say enough about this hotel. I plan to return in the fall with my husband for a romantic weekend. Thank you! Review #85:This hotel is beautiful, luxurious, and in an excellent location! Staff was amazingly helpful and friendly. The location was perfect -- directly behind Notre Dame and walking distance from nearly anything! The room was spacious, we loved the bathroom and fireplace. The hotel only has queen beds, which were cozy. Only negative was the continental breakfast , which was just so-so and the upgrade to hot for $9 was ridiculous. Review #86:As a free quant traveller I would say this hotel is high up my list of great stays. This is a great hotel for business or vacation stay. The rooms are big and clean and the hotel is very well located, everything is within a short ride or walking distance. Review #87:this was our first trip alone since the birth of our daughter 3 years ago so we wanted it to be restful, luxurious and elegant. It was all three, definitely. Our room --- a Deluxe Suite -- was on the 6th floor and had both a fireplace and a balcony. The room, while slightly in decor, felt like our own personal pied-a-terre in old Mtl - we loved coming back for a late afternoon nap, cocktail hour on the patio and time to get ready for dinner in the well-appointed bathroom. The espresso machine was a great touch and continental breakfast on the Terrace was all we could have asked for to set off each great day. The neighbourhood is under construction, but there are still lots of opportunities for lovely moonlit walks down cobblestone streets. The hotel recommends some great restaurants on its website (see: \"for foodies\") and we tried two of them (thanks to reservations by the Concierge) and were totally amazed at the quality of the food. All in all, the Saint Sulpice feels very old school, quiet, and lovely - not for the party crowd or those who want the most modern feel - but wonderful for those who want to just enjoy a true Montreal vibe in a great area. Review #88:Le Saint Sulpice was a delightful stay in the heart of Old Montreal. Granted, Montreal has some funky neighborhoods and unusual B&Bs, but we could stay in Vieux Montreal and easily walk to those neighborhoods--or take the metro from the Place D'Armes station. The staff at Saint Sulpice was very helpful when we needed any help, which was just once on arrival to adjust the air conditioning. Breakfast was included in the room price, also good because eating out every meal in Old Montreal can add up quickly. It is tres chic and the prices are too. The decor was well done. The bathroom was exceptional with large walk-in shower. All in all, very good value for the area. Review #89:We were knocked out by this hotel, where we stayed for five nights in April. (five females) The staff were lovely, the rooms top class, and the location (none of us had a car) is ideal for the shops, restaurants and sightseeing. It was a superb holiday and we have decided to go back once the weather gets a bit warmer. Review #90:We were allocated a Loft Suite and at first thought the many negative comments on this site about their Murphy beds were over the top as we normally like a firm bed. We are not from North America and had not seen one of these before - they can be folded back up into their frame on the wall to create space. This seemed strange since the suite had loads of space. With a 3 night stay, the bed did seem firm but OK on night 1. Night 2 involved a lot of tossing and turning with the lower sheet not staying in place as it was not big enough to reach under the mattress. Night 3 was the same, also affected by a lot of outside noise until the small hours (a Thursday evening) and I woke up to backache which did not clear throughout the following day. Otherwise, large well equipped room, free wifi and great location. The bed had a decent quilt and pillows, and the bathroom had a separate bathtub and shower. The shower was a bit feeble and (most strangely), the toilet roll was fitted on the wall opposite the toilet and out of reach. Good continental breakfast with juice, meats, various breads and croissants etc, and some delicious pots of panna cotta. Review #91:I've recently stayed at the St-Sulpice as I wanted a special place to do my wedding proposal. One day before my arrival,I called the concierge (Patrick) who ended up working miracles for me. I told him: do whatever it takes to make it nice, fuzzy, warm and romantic. He had the flowers, the rose petals, the music, the candles, the fireplace, the violonist, the champagne, the strawberries, etc. His ideas were unlimited. Of course my girlfriend said: YES!!! Nonetheless, the room was charming, the rest of the staff was way up to par more so than many hotels I've traveled in. This staff takes their job to heart and it shows. Great bellmen and frontdesk clerks. Very few names I remembered cause they were all great. (Dave, Rafel, Mike, Julian, Mary-Helen). Wow! St-Sulpice, you know what it takes to be on the top, BRAVO! I will definitely come back in remembrance of this day. Thank you all for your great work! Review #92:I took my husband for a weekend away to celebrate his 40th birthday and I wanted to make it a special weekend for him. The hotel was the perfect beginning to a wonderful weekend. Right from the front door we were greeted by smiling faces and helpful employees who made every effort to meet our needs. The staff were always very prompt with any requests (such as running right up to deliver an internet cable for our laptop when we had difficulty with the wireless connection) to calling for taxis for us when needed. The room was beautiful and even had a wood burning fireplace (we did not make use of this, but it was a really nice touch). The location of the hotel was ideal for exploring the old section of Montreal. We had dinner in the restaurant Le S on Friday night. The food was incredible!! Service from Simon was impecable and there was even a lovely jazz trio to entertain us. Overall we loved our stay at Le Saint Sulpice and look forward to staying there again. Review #93:My husband and I love boutique hotels and by far, the Saint Sulpice is our favorite getaway. It's located in old Montreal by the Cathedral and surrounded by great shops and by loads of entertainment. The food and staff are always spectacular, and the location is superb. I understand that there are options to purchase a suite. It is well worth it since there are many festivals that occur in Montreal such as film festivals, and the famous jazz festival. During the Christmas Holidays, they do a superb job of decorating as well. Overall, it is an ezqusite boutique hotel and charming in every way! Review #94:We were told that the room has just been renovated. It was large with a queen bed, a sofa and arm chair beside, an electric fireplace, a desk, and a kitchenette. The coffee maker makes really good espresso and factor in I have a fansy espresso machine at home! The bathroom has a large bath AND a large shower! You still find a lot of room for two people in there. Beside the restaurent that is average, it is the best place I have been in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al. Review #95:I can't believe this lovely boutique hotel in Montreal is not in the top 10 list of recommended accommodations. We had a beautifully appointed suite with living room (including a sofa bed for our daughter), separate bedroom and full kitchenette for the price or a regular hotel room anywhere else. The setup is perfect for families, but the quaint, nicely furnished and quiet room would also make this a great choice for a romantic getaway. And the location couldn't be better -- right in the heart of Old Montreal. Review #96:I stayed here with my mom and sister and we had a great experience (amazing location, great staff, clean rooms, etc.) EXCEPT for when we had a drink one night in the garden. We ordered a cheese plate and two glasses of champagne (didn't specify which) and the bill was $75 for the champagne. We almost choked it back up and told the waiter who returned with the \"fixed\" bill, which was $50 for the champagne. This really left us with a bad taste in our mouths in an otherwise wonderful 3-night stay with no other issues. We felt rather cheated - if it was indeed that much, at least let us know if the price when ordering. Review #97:First off, I want to say that the hotel is a nice property, with great staff, in a beautiful area. But, I think it really depends what you are looking for, and what your preference is. For my wife and I, we didn't realize until staying at st. sulpice that we prefer a cozy (but good size) hotel room over a suite hotel room with kitchenette, and living area space. I think these rooms are ideal for people who have a family, or have friends over to enjoy a drink before a night on the town. If thats the case, st. sulpice can't be beat. As for the location, it's ideal for old montreal, but it's still a 20 minute walk or so up to saint catherine. There are many other hotels which are located more in the middle (10 minutes to old montreal, 10 minutes to downtown). But again, if staying in Old Montreal is your thing, the location can't be beat. Another thing which I noticed on tripadvisor were the comments about the murphy bed. I agree, there is simply no need for it, and it's not all that comfortable. The room is big enough, I won't need to put the bed back into the wall to save space? Also, the shower 'wall' which you can see the shadows from the living room just doesn't make alot of sense. I'm into chic and trendy things, but I found this unnecessary. So, I don't want to be too hard on st. sulpice (I did give it 4) because although it's not exactly what my wife and I were looking for, it could be ideal for others. Review #98:(We actually stayed here in August of 2010, not September). The rooms here are elegant and comfortable. The staff is helpful and respectful, especially with the valet parking. The restaurant has excellent food and service. Breakfast is good. We loved it here. Review #99:We recently stayed at the St-Sulpice for a weekend and was treated terribly. It first began with the valet being rude as he thought maybe because I was driving an inexpensive 1998 Toyota Camry, I should not park in front of the hotel. He was extremely rude while informing me and my wife that it was for GUests Only!! He was shocked to learn we were guests. Check in was a disaster, as they could not find our rsvp( Good thing my wife printed the confirmation letter) After seeing our room, we felt better but it was dirty still!!! The bellman apologized and we returned to the lobby until it could be fixed. One Hour later!!! For the price we paid, they did not even compensate us with anything! Breakfast the next morning was good but the staff didnot have any information on bus tours and seemed clueless? Overall. it was not a memorable experience, and I unfortunately cannot reccommend this hotel. It is it worth 400$? Never!", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Our impression is really the same like the first time. The location is fantastic, the value and the reasonable quality makes it hard to beat. The hotel felt a bit more worn than the first time we stayed here, seems that not too much money is spent on refurbishment. I doubt that we'll be back for a third time. Nevertheless, I you want to stay in center of Barcelona without paying megabucks, we can recommend this hotel. Review #1:I stayed in hotel Regina for 3 days with my mum and sister and overall we were very happy with the hotel. Staff were friendly enough nice,modern,clean, and spacious room the only falt was that the rooms were very dark ther were only spotlights that were extremely dull but overall we enjoyed our stay and would definetly recommend this hotel as the location is great :) x Review #2:The hotel is centrally located at the foot of Las Ramblas. If you want to be in the heart of the city, this is the place. The rooms are clean, well appointed and modern. The service was above average to good. The staff made an effort to accomodate me with my issues and did their best. I found a great rate on the internet and I strongly believe that I received the best bang for my buck for Barcelona. Note to light sleepers! The walls are pretty thin and you can hear even the slightest activity outside your door. But, this is understandable given the age of the building. Review #3:The Hotel Regina is in a fantastic location, just off La Rambla and the Placa del Catalonya. It is next door to the Pulitzer Hotel and has the same manager. I was there for 5 days in April 2008. I had requested a room on a higher floor, away from the elevators and maid storage room, with a balcony. I received exactly what I had requested. The hotel provides all guests with a complimentary bottle of cava and a box of dessert chocolates - a very nice touch. The staff was very helpful and attentative. Maid service was terrific. The bar area serves some food or you can go to the dining room at the Pulitzer Hotel. There is room service - breakfast through late evening. The hotel room itself was great - nice size for a European hotel, extremely comfortable bed, in room safe and television, nice bathroom with amenities. It made for a very pleasant experience and stay in Barcelona Review #4:We couldn't believe how close to the very centre this hotel was- on a side street just off Placa Catalunya- less than a 2 min walk from the square that's on the top of La Ramblas. Yet the hotel is far enough away not to be noisy at night, and the street is very quiet at night. The room we stayed in was small- but I've stayed in smaller rooms in higher star hotels in London, and so I expected it in such a central hotel. Esp as we booked through a discount website and not directly. The bed did take up most of the bedroom space and the window looked out over a dark alleyway so not much natural light. However the room looked to be recently refurbished and was very comfortable and I didn't feel at all claustrophobic despite the room size. The bathroom was gorgeous, and the shower was wonderful- very powerful. The toiletries they provide are lovely and they also provide robes and slippers. There's also free internet all over the hotel, which is great if you've a laptop or iphone. The bar is really nice- big comfortable sofas and a big cocktail menu. The staff in the hotel are all very friendly and helpful. They also have discount rates for the bus tours and are quite happy to book restaurants and answer any questions. I really couldn't fault this hotel at all and if we return to Barcelona it would definitely be our first choice. Review #5:We stayed here one night pre cruise on June 13, 2009. The hotel has a great location near the top of Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. Our room wasn't ready as we arrived in the morning, but they will gladly stored our luggage for us. We had a family room which was a large room with four comfortable beds (two of the beds were pushed together to form a queen size bed) so all four of us could stay in one room. The bathroom was good sized and had wonderful amenities (shampoo, lotions, and individual toiletry kits for gentleman and ladies). There are also three computers with internet access available for free us which was convenient. The only problem with the room is that the air conditioning did not work very well and the room was hot (it was 78 degrees F in the room most of the time). Fortunately, we were so tired that we slept fine anyways. The staff was fairly friendly and called a taxi for us when we departed the next day for the pier. Review #6:I stayed at the Hotel Regina last week, having selected the hotel after a great deal of research. Besides wanting a nice facility with decent-sized rooms, I was very concerned about being able to avoid smoke. I sought a guarantee about all public space being smoke-free, as well as my room. To my delight, this was the case. No smoking allowed in the lobby, the restaurant, the Internet area, which is exactly what I wanted. And the room had no lingering odor, and was quite clean and comfortable. The beds could have been more comfortable, however. Very standard mattresses. Also, I would have liked a clock in the room - bring your own. The location is excellent, and close to a major Metro stop. It's always just a very short walk from the bustling Ramlas and Boqueria Market, a real bonus. Another positive is the assistance I received from a young man named Derek, who helped me out with a tricky dilemma, by making calls in Spanish for me, and being very accommodating. The area towards the back of the lobby was just right for use of the Internet, and because there are three computers, I always found one available, a real necessity when traveling. I can highly recommend this hotel. Review #7:Stayed a few nights in this hotel in November, 2011. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. The hotel is nice and the rooms are nice, standard sized European rooms, with hardwood floors. The breakfast that comes with the hotel package is a standard European breakfast - both scrambled and boiled eggs, cold cereals and oatmeal, several types of ham, sausages, and bacon; pastries, several types of breads/rolls, butter, jam, fruits, orange juice, milk, and mineral water, all buffet style. There is free Wi-Fi access. The hotel is situated around the corner from Las Ramblas, which is great if you like the activity of Las Ramblas without having to hear it in your hotel room. The hotel is directly across the street from the entrance of the Metro station, but with the room I stayed in, I had no problems, couldn't hear the train at all, just peace and quiet. Had a walk-out balcony, which was nice to view the surrounding area. In my opinion, it's best to take a Taxi to the hotel. There are buses and the metro nearby, but depending on the time of night and how much luggage you have, it's probably better to take a taxi if you're not familiar with the area. Of course there's tons of stores and eateries in the Las Ramblas area. I suggest getting the hop-on/hop-off tour bus pass from the hotel, it's a few Euros cheaper and well worth it. Start out early though, as it takes you to other nice areas to shop and eat and lots of beautiful sights to see. I've been to Barcelona previously, so I definitely felt comfortable in the area. Even if I hadn't visited previously, would definitely still feel comfortable being out and about alone. Hard Rock Cafe is a five minute walk away as well, if you're interested. Staff was great there too!! Would definitely recommend this hotel again and again. Review #8:From Goh S.B. and Family... We have 4 nights of wonderful stay in Regina Hotel Barcelona just last week. The Family Room is huge - 4 single beds with large space to move around. It is very clean - it seems that the housekeeper would come in to clean and tidy up the room each time we are out. The receptionists are friendly and have no problem conversing in English. Breakfast is good, with wide range of meat, cereals, fruits and juices. A bit expensive though. I am particularly glad that the management readily modified the room rate each time it is reduced from time of my booking. One thing we find missing in the room - the complimentary coffee and tea, or at least an electric kettle. Though Starbuck is just next door, it is always great to return to the room and make for ourselves a cup of real hot drink to complete the day, especially during winter. Location is fantastic. Very convenient - direct transport by Aeroport Bus from the airport. This Hotel will definitely be our first choice if we decide to re-visit Barcelona. Review #9:I stayed here as single female traveller for 4 nights in a single room. Room - is clean and comfortable. This is the only hotel in all the Spain hotels i've been in that actually supplied full set of toiletries in particular toothbrush, sanitary bags, shower cap and slippers. The toilet could use better cleaning cuz it smelled a bit bad. The room is otherwise comfortable and well maintained. I also agree with other reviews that the banging doors could be a bit annoying. I also stayed at their sister hotel Pulitzer Hotel, in comparison Regina's decor is not as stylish, and service is not as comprehensive but the facilities are almost just as good. Service - is good. A few faults I could pick: The room service plates were not collected until housekeeping cleans your room the next day. The other thing was I posted 2 postcards via the reception and these are the only 2 cards that didn't reach the recipient. Not sure the reception or the postal service was to blame. Location - is excellent. Feels very safe to walk back to at night. Just 2 minutes away from the middle of town Plaza de Catalunya, where the tourist buses depart from and where the tourist information center is located. Very close to the Rambla and the surrounding shopping area. Walking distance to Barri Gotic and even to attractions that are further north such as Casa Batllo if you care to walk a bit further. Review #10:We stayed at this hotel 9 - 11 May 2009. The rooms were clean, modern and very comfortable. The only downside being there is no storage space for clothes! The hotel is right in the centre of everything and with a Starbucks next door which we made full use of during our stay. I would definately recommend this hotel to all types of traveller. Review #11:stayed one night after finding the jazz hotel fully booked, check in was ok. location is pretty good. Once in room were disappointed to find that the room looked like it needed a paint, scuff marks on the walls etc. The ac vent was filthy, lucky we could open the balcony doors we were a bit frightened to use the ac ! Beats me why the management can't just book a room out for a day and paint the walls ! also the hall way carpet stained in places. The room was quiet though and the bed , linen was good. Its probably ok value but the jazz is better. Our room rate included breakfast (32e) but we were leaving before 7 so couldn't have the breakfast. I was a bit p*ssed off when the guy at the desk would not refund the 32E. Would not stay there again Review #12:My wife and I spent five nights at the Regina. It is a lovely hotel situated in a nice street just off Placa de Catalunya and near Las Ramblas. Perfect location. Our room, situated on the fifth floor facing the street, was quiet, very clean with a good range of toiletries and linen was regularily replaced. Provision of robes and slipppers in the room and free access to the internet near reception was a bonus. Only small gripe about the room was the space at foot of bed which was too narrow to allow our larger case to be pulled through. However general layout and space in room and bathroom was excellent. Reception staff were very efficient, helpful and friendly. A couple who were with us had problems with a leaking shower but the response to their complaint was immediate. Attempted repair was ineffective but they were offered a change of room - excellent response and service. Overall this is a great hotel but let down by the breakfast. We found the hot dishes and the \"hot\" water for tea to be lukewarm and one morning we waited 25 minutes for the bacon to be replenished despite being advised, a few times \"it will only be a minute\". However the range of food on offer was fairly good. We used the hop on hop off bus for two days and found it very useful. The Bus Touristic is the most popular and there were long queues at a few stops. The other company, red buses, did not appear to have queues but check which sites they visit. The discount booklet provided helped save a few euros on entrance fees. You can also save couple of euros by purchasing your bus pack from reception. Expect to queue at some of the more popular attractions e.g. to get on the lift in the Sagrada Familia we would have had to queue for about one and a half hours. Review #13:Our family of 4 stayed here 1 night post cruise and chose the hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and I can see why the hotel gets such a high rating. It couldn't be in a better location, only a 100 yds off Catalunya in a quiet side street. It's a stylish hotel with a very welcoming staff and nice public areas. Our quad room was large and well equipped with nice touches such as bathrobes and slippers and a complimentary plate of fruit and water provided in the evening. The bathroom was big, with plenty of fluffy towels and the bedroom had a large TV with a good selection of channels. The free internet (and WiFi) was a welcome addition - particularly since our stay coincided with 2 VERY rainy days! A couple of minor gripes - the room was VERY hot and although it appeared to have aircon this didn't work - despite the fairly cool weather we still needed to keep the window wide open to air the room. The design of the hotel (wooden floors) doesn't lend itself to quiet - we stayed in a similar hotel in Barcelona before and found the same thing. The breakfast looked very good - but not worth 17 euros so we opted to go elsewhere. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, or to stay here again when we next visit this wonderful city Review #14:This hotel was just off \"La Rambla\" which is perfect. It's a 5 minute walk to the main action! You don't want to stay right on La Rambla in August because it's very noisy and busy. The hotel itself has excellent rooms, great breakfast and very comfortable. It has a large convenience store accross the road for your necessities (water & snacks) and a star bucks next door. It's also only a 4 blocks from La Predera and about 30 minutes walk to Sagrada familia. The only negative is that the rooms are a little on the small side but I would rather comfort, luxury and small then large and not comfortable. Review #15:Cannot beat the location for this nicely furnished comfortable hotel just of the Plaza Catalunya. Close to the Ramblas without the noise and very near shopping, airport bus and tour buses. Flat screen tv, ample size rooms with comfortable beds and quiet. Only one problem. When I woke in the middle of the night to use the bathroom saw a bug in the bathroom. My only complaint. Imagine it may have come from the drain in the bathroom but still was dissappointing. In fairness to the hotel, I did not mention to the management because I didnt think there was anything they could do about this situation but did mention to housekeeping. All in all the hotel was clean Review #16:The hotel has a great location near La Rambla no doubt about that but it is very noisy. We could hear when people talked in the hallway, when people flushed their toilet and when the metro passed underneath the hotel (which it did very often). The staff in the reception was very helpfull and the service was great. Overall we had a very nice trip but we expected that a 4 star hotel would be more quiet. Review #17:We were seven women travelling together to celebrate a birthday. It is not easy to find rooms sleeping so many people at once, but we were able to book into a 4 and a 3 room. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, the location was really convenient and the service was great. A perfect choice for this sort of a weekend! Review #18:We had 3 nights at the Regina and couldn't fault it. The rooms were excellent and the location is ideal - just off the Placa Catalunya 5 minutes from the airport bus. Staff were friendly and very helpful. We were directed to a tapas restaurant on our first night and had an excellent meal at a very reasonalbe price, not you usual hotel recommended rip-off. Nice bar downstairs. Only niggle is that breakfast is good but expensive at 16 euros per person I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a relaxed and easy stay in Barcelona Review #19:Hotel Regina has great location. It is a walking distance to Las Ramblas, Plaza Catalunya, Barri Gothic, etc. The rooms are huge and clean but the bathrooms are small. The bathroom tiles are kinda old as well as the hallway tiles. There are chipping. I love the internet room . Internet is free. The lobby is just OK. The staff in the front desk are NOT so friendly. There is only one small elevator. It could accomodate only 4 people. But what turned me off with this hotel is the rate/night. Paying $200/night without breakfast is too much. There are much better hotels around the area with this rate. Review #20:This hotel was located right off of Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya which is right where you want to stay in Barcelona. The metro picks up right down the street and if using the Aerobus from the airport you can get to this hotel for 5 euro each which drops off a block from hotel in plaza catalunya. I believe this is the central area in Barcelona. Hotel is clean... make sure you get the updated rooms. We booked 3 rooms and the two rooms which were with 2 single beds were very updated. The one we got with the double bed was a little older, bathroom was not as updated as the others but still clean. But for the price and location and the complimentary breakfast made it good for traveling with family. I would highly recommend this hotel and wish we booked it for after our cruise as well since the location was so good. Girl at the front desk was so helpful and helped us get into a triple room which i could not book online but she was able to get for me saving me from getting a 4th room for only one person since we traveled with a family of 7. Review #21:As regular visitors to Barca, we have never quite found a hotel that has met our needs as well as the Regina. Family rooms are difficult to find or are ridiculously expensive. This hotel was perfect for us, a great central location with a decent sized room. What really made our stay so pleasant was the helpful staff - everyone's English was excellent and a couple of members of staff really made us feel welcome, particularly an older gentlemen who attended the front desk and showed us to our rooms (he had a twinkle in his eye) and the lady with short dark curly hair who attended to us at breakfast. Review #22:Stayed at the Hotel Regina for 2 nights in August in a family room. The room was exceptionally spacious, the bathroom well stocked with towels, robes and toiletries. The beds were the most comfortable we have ever had in an hotel room anywhere in the world. Our teenage girls especially appreciated the free internet. The hotel is brilliantly situated for exploring Barcelona with most of the attractions within easy walking distance. The family room offers good value for money. The staff are very friendly and accomodating. I can thoroughly recommend the hotel. Review #23:From this hotel you can get wherever you want. Actually it is in the middle of everything. Metro and busses just next, nor far from the market, the sea and the Gaudi buildings. The room was nice and clean and big. We had an excellent view. We also received a bottle of cava and chocolate from the hotel which was very nice. Sometimes it was a bit noisy in the night, you could hear the train... but that's normal for a hotel with such an excellent location. The bed was very comfortable too. Would definitely stay there again. Review #24:I am an avid user of trip advisor so I felt it was time that I began to help other travelers in their hotel decision making. We travel a lot and like very nice hotels. This is hard hotel to review because there were a lot of things we liked about it and then a lot we did not. The location is EXCELLENT. Off on a side street around the corner from Las Ramblas and the Plaza Cantalunya...it can't be beat. We walked everywhere but were happy to come back at night to a more peaceful environment. I would not recommend staying on Las Ramblas at any of those hotels. The staff is very courteous and helpful Free wireless- a huge plus when traveling with young adults. The hotel itself is just moderate. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are even smaller. The decor is very minimalist. We had just come from the Westin Palace in Madrid...a true 4-5 star hotel. This hotel just isn't. There was a really weird odor coming into our room every night...almost sulphur like. There was a vent in the bathroom that vented into an interior shaft and when I closed the vent, the smell subsided somewhat. The first room we were put in had black mold on the ceiling around the A/C vent...I found it hard to get that out of my mind even though the staff gladly moved us into another room. Overall our stay at the Regina was fine...but that's it..just fine. I think there are better hotels in Barcelona in this price category. Review #25:Everything about the hotel we loved: the spacious rooms, wonderful location and the helpful staff. We stayed there for 4 nights. THE ROOM: Modern and spacious (positively huge since we just came from our tiny room in Paris). The room was well appointed with two double beds, big LCD TV (some English channels), huge bathroom with bidet, separate area for sink and tub w/shower, lots of desk space. We requested a quieter room and got room 219, it was fairly quiet. Our bathroom did have a view of the back of the El Triangle sign that faced Carrer de Pelai. THE LOCATION: A block from the Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. The train, subway and airport shuttle bus are all within a blocks walking distance. The shops of Eixample and Diaganol are a close stroll. Food and drink wise are abundantly close and of varying prices and quality. There are great places to eat at everywhere. We tried to avoid eating on Ramblas since we thought it was all touristy. There is a Co-op supermarket directly across the street from the hotel. From the hotel it was an easy walk to Gothic Quarter, Barceloneta Beach, Born District, Eixample shops. THE SERVICE: We had arrived at 9:30 in the morning and the staff were very helpful getting us the best possible room. We were surprised by a bottle of champagne in our room. The manager had sent It for our 10 year anniversary. We were always greeted warmly by staff. The location of the hotel made it close to everywhere. From experience, we've come to realize location is the key to a great vacationing experience. Hotel Regina certainly has that in spades. Literally steps from all the action, yet still a quiet night rest. We could easily drop off shopping or siesta in the afternoon yet still be in the thick of things once we were ready to go. The spacious room and great staff made this one of our best stays ever! Review #26:Great location, very nice hotel, lovely staff. Only problem was that the rooms had poor sound insulation. Ours was just above the bar and hence quite noisy. Ask for a room to the atrium at the end of the hallway and you should be fine. Also the quality in the bar varied quite a bit, from very good to barely okay. Review #27:We stayed there for 5 nights in October 2011 in a standard double room with a small terrasse overlooking the street. The best part of this hotel is the location as it is right at the intersection of La Rambla (the main tourist strip in the Old City) and Passeig de Gracia (the main shopping street). Travelling by taxi to Placa Catalunya can be a bit bothersome at times as there were often protests and other reasons that the area around the square was blocked off from traffic. Although if you are planning on travelling by foot and metro, the location is very convenient. The area is quite noisy and the street itself is a small side street that is not very nice though. The room was on the small side but still comfortable for two people. It was very clean, with the exception of the shower that could have benefited from a soap-scum scrub down. No full length mirror unfortunately. We were happy that they gave us a room with a terrasse. Overall the room was good for a standard double. The service at the hotel was kind of poor - reception was not friendly (no smiles) and seemed a bit aggravated at times when we asked for help. Not what I was expecting from a 4 star hotel. Overall, our experience there was decent. Next time I'm in Barcelona, I would rather stay on the nearby street Rambla de Catalunya as this is much more picturesque, still perfectly located and has several nice 4-star boutique hotels. Review #28:Stayed for two nights. We liked the hotel very much; friendly/service minded staff, great location, nice design in hotel/room and cool lounge. Breakfast was good with sufficient range of offers. Very central location attractive to us just next to Pla\u00e7a Catalonia, Pla\u00e7a Universitat, Las Ramblas and El Corte Ingles. Quick access to metro for reaching sightseeing goals. Our room had double balcony doors so the lively noise of Barcelona did not disturb us at least. Room door was however not very soundproof - so could hear if anyone slammed the door during night, but we slept quite well. In our view this stay was good value for money. Review #29:Our one night stay at the Hotel Regina was excellent in every way. Jose Sanchez, the general manager, was extremely helpful to me prior to our stay via email. He went above and beyond in making sure we got what we requested. The rooms were very clean, modern and large for European standards and its location perfect for getting around. I would not hesitate in staying here again and would recommend this hotel to our family or friends. Review #30:This palce is really great! I love how it's so conveniently located near Placa Catalunya. Just across the street there's a mini grocery, and half a block down you will find the red tour buses and the airport bus (no need to transfer!). My friend and I only had a couple of days to see barcelona so I thought booking a hotel that's central would be best. We arrived after 1AM because our flight was delayed, and they gave us a small discount which was reasonable. The whole trip was excellent, we were able to go to all the museums and parks during the day by red tour buses which starts at the Placa Catalunya (all buses passby this block), took the Metro and walked around the gothic quarters and the surrounding areas because it's really just a few blocks away. There are a few familiar shops around the area, but you can also take the tour bus that stops right across the malls. The only thing I didn't like are the cafes and some restaurants in the area. They all tasted as though they microwave just about everything. We were able to sum a lot of Barcelona in 2 days. If we stayed further out we would have spent just as much on cabs and waste time on trying to figure out the bus and train schedules. Plus the staff is great! Although the concierge didn't explain that there are TWO red bus compaines meaning TWO different line ups (which you can figure out once you get there), everything else was great. Review #31:We stayed in this hotel for a week vacation in Barcelona. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, they've even organized tickets for a football match (which was quite complicated as we arrived on the match day). The hotel is modern and has all neccesary facilities, including free WiFi access. The breakfast is good, though a little variation would be welcomed. One thing to ruin it all was extremly lousy sound insulation - it sounds like walls are made of carton or something. Every day we followed the same routine - at night you cannot sleep because of neighbours returning from famous Barcelona nightlife. In the morning our wake up was set at 7:00 when the cleaning personell is starting to vacuum clean the corridor talking out loud to each other. Later, when early birds start to go for sightseeing, we could hear every word they said. All in all, the hotel management has to do something to improve this, because otherwise the hotel is mostly reccomended. Review #32:After spending what felt like days googling hotels in barcelona I stumbled onto Hotel Regina and booked an early booking offer via a discount webpage. Very friendly hotel staff greeted us on arrival and directed us to our room - 408. I booked the trip for my boyfriends birthday and about 10minutes after getting settled the door went and it was a birthday cake and champagne courtesy of the hotel - very nice touch!! Rooms are lovely . Spotlessly clean and our maid done a fantastic job - coming back each night to an immaculately tidy room. Mini bar has a variety of drinks and snacks. Location is excellent - 30seconds walk from plaza catalunya. Have already recommended Hotel Regina to everyone Ive spoken to! Everything about it gets a thumbs up from me! ! Review #33:I arranged for our small staff to stay at the Hotel Regina during a convention in June of 2008. Even before we arrived, the staff at the hotel was very responsive to questions that we sent via email, etc. Once we arrived, I was again pleasantly surprised at how nice and helpful the staff was. The lobby was small, but very well kept and beautiful. The rooms were comfortable and really modern, clean and nice. The internet was free, so that was great as well! The hotel is in a great area, very close to the Catalonia Ramblas. It wasn't very close to the convention center, but the subway was close and easy to use. Review #34:Location is great, by walk; 1min to Pl Catalunya, 3mins to La Rambla, 10-15 mins to Barri Gothic and cathedrals etc.. We did not prefer a hotel on La Rambla street, we thought it might be too loudy for sleep. So the best choice for us was around Pl Catalunya. Even on the day of new year 31.12, we slept very well although there was still new year celebrations going on Pl Catalunya. We stayed at a standart room which was clean but a little bit tiny. The room door was opening very close to our bed, that was a little uncomfortable however, at the end of the day, the size is good for a city centre based hotel. A bigger room can be an alternative. Breakfast was fine. Staff was friendly. We didnt face any problems and would definitely check for the next visit. Review #35:A Hotel that started life in 1917 is bound to have issues in it's infrastructure, but this was more than compensated with the BEST staff ever ... ...although the General Manager Sr. Jose M\u00aa Sanchez-Harguindey was away, it was left in Good Hands... My sincere thanks to Rafael, Jose and especially Lucilla, who sorted out our Flight Problems with the staff at Easyjet (should be renamed Hardjet). ~ Highly recommend this Hotel and the Staff are 5* Review #36:This hotel was absolutely super for what I needed. It could have been anywhere in the world, and a single room had a large single bed only (which is quite unusual in my experience). Everything was clean and tidy and there was a nice fluffy robe and slippers. The shower was good but leaked (didn't flood the bathroom), the mini bar wasn't replenished, and the balcony was just odd (see pictures), but based on what other people told me I got a bargain for where I was staying. The metro rumbles a bit underground, but certainly not enough to actually disturb my sleep. I'd definitely go back here if I went to Barcelona again. Review #37:We flew in to Barcelona and had a cruise to catch the next day. The hotel was perfect. The location was right in the heart of the city. starbucks was next door and the main city square was right out the door. They offered to do anything we asked. We were shocked how helpful and kind the staff was. the bar was warm and the lobby was clean and neat. Rooms were typical for a city. They were very clean and neat. Bathrooms were very modern and more than functionable. We are looking forward to finding a reason to go back to Barcelona and enjoy their hospitality for a longer stay. When we returned back from the cruise they stored our luggage until our flight . no charge... Very class act. they sold us on how to treat a guest - Not sure anyone can match their quality but we do travel a bit so we are using them for a benchmark. They also corrdinated private drivers to meet us everywhere we asked Review #38:Overall the hotel was of a good standard, however there were several things that really let it down and caused us (the customer) more hassle than we wanted. When we arrived early the staff appeared to be quite accomodating and gave us a room key etc - when we got to the room it was appalling, next to a cleaner's cupboard and with no window - it was small and not worthy of the 118 euros my now fiancee (he proposed in Barcelona) paid for it. After going back to reception I said that I was not happy with the room, the staff member (whose name was maybe Sr. Jose?) did not argue but said ok, as I began to justify why I wanted to change he was quite rude and did not listen to my reasons which outlined what we wanted. He offered us another room but said we'd need to wait until it was clean - that was fine and we went for a stroll. When we got back his colleague (who was really nice) showed us the room - we still weren't happy with it really, it had a window but no view as it was behind a billboard. I said that this was a birthday treat and could he not organise a nicer room for us. He was again very rude and ignored what I'd said but claimed that this was the last room in the hotel! We reluctantly accepted the room and did have a really nice time in Barcelona. When we checked out two days later the staff were so friendly and polite, as were the breakfast staff who served us. The location is brilliant, the breakfast is brilliant, rooms vary, the actual standard is good but some have either no window or decent view, the staff vary - some were brilliant some were really rude and unwelcoming, with lack of understanding for customer service. Seriously dampened the start of our visit to Barcelona! Review #39:Stayed at the Hotel Regina in May for 3 nights. I booked two rooms and I couldn't have been happier with the two rooms we were allocated. The rooms were really spacious and modern and both had great outlooks and even although both rooms were to the front of the hotel they were both really quiet at night. One of the rooms was for my brother and I booked this on a \"double room for single occupancy rate\" and I have to say it was well worth booking this room. I had emailed ahead with specific requiremets and they were met in every way. Every member of staff, from reception to bar staff were extremely professional and helpful. We used the facilities of the adjoining Pulitzer hotel, ie. roof top bar and courtyard, if we returned during the day, and on returning to the hotel later on in the evening used the bar area at the Regina. On returning to the UK I wrote to the Manager to thank him and his staff and received a really nice response from him, which I wasn't expecting. I had such a good time in Barcelona and was so happy with the hotel that I couldn't even say goodbye to the staff as we left as I was crying!! Would most definitely return to this hotel. Review #40:We had a terrific time in this hotel. It was clean, comfortable and a nice size for our family (two adults and two children), especially by European standards. Very close for a nice stroll to the Plaza Cataluna and Las Ramblas. Near Casa Batllo as well. We stayed here prior to our cruise and found it convenient to the port area. We loved the free wifi internet access as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again when we return to glorious Barcelona. Review #41:The Hotel Regina is in the perfect location, just around the corner from \"Las Ramblas\", and directly across the street from the Metro. It's an older Hotel, but was tidy with clean rooms and a nice lounge area. However, I would not recommend this Hotel, as the walls are paper thin and we could hear every sound made by the housekeeping staff and other Hotel guests. We booked four rooms for our extended Christmas family vacation, for 9 adults and 1 child. The housekeeping staff staging area was located on our floor. This consisted of an archaic service elevator and supply room, which was accessed from early morning until evening daily. The loud clanking continued throughout the day and evening for our entire 9 day stay. Although the housekeeping staff and bartenders were wonderful, I was shocked that the front desk staff refused to ask our upstairs neighbor to refrain from allowing their child to run sprints back and forth in the hall at 2 am, on the floor above. We were told, \"we can't help you with that., but we can give you their room number and you can call yourself if you'd like.\" You could literally hear every minute sound. The bare hardwood floors and thin walls made getting a goodnight sleep nearly impossible! This would not be the place for honeymooners. On a brighter note, although there is no restaurant on site, delicious meals are available via room service from the Hotel next door. The food is very good and the prices are reasonable. Review #42:We tried this hotel during a 2night stopover on the basis of previous trip advisor reviews & completely satisfied with all aspects. The hotel staff were friendly & courteous, spotless rooms with large well equipped bathrooms. The location was ideal for all tourist attractions & 2min walk to the main bus area for connections to nearby attractions. Review #43:Great price, great service, nice clean rooms (somewhat modern too), and PRIME location, 5 minutes walk from Las Ramblas and walkable to the seaport/pier on a mild day. Not to mention there is a metro, hop off/on bus and Aerobus right down the street and around the corner from convenient shopping. Review #44:We were here for 3 days last month and thouroughly enjoyed our time. Barcelona has so many beautiful sights and this hotel is in the ideal location to walk, hail a cab, or take the metro. The staff was helpful and friendly and gave us great tips for restaurants, especially Brasseria Flo. We ate there twice! We did eat at the breakfast buffet and as mentioned, there were limited hot choices. The fresh fruit and pastries were nice as well as the Iberian ham. it was not worth 16E each, possibly 10E would be more appropriate. The beds and pillows were comfy. The shampoo, lotions, etc were of good quality. We did not watch tv, but there seemed to be a few English choices. There was a little noise/movement from the metro. We will certainly stay here again. Review #45:This hotel is in a really good location at the top of Las Ramblas and very convenient for the excellent airport buses to the main airport (but equally convenient for Reus or Girona as so close to Placa Catalunya). Really convenient for the Tour bus, walking to anywhere, the train and or local buses. Our room was spacious with bath and shower, robes and slippers, chocolate left on the overturned sheet on the bed. Check in was easy and pleasant even though we arrived at getting on for midnight, bar staff pleasant (although its expensive in the bar), efficient cleaning, helpful reception staff, easy check out. The only fault you could make from my perspective is that Barcelona is an incredibly noisy city all through the night and this hotel is equally a victim of that - but I can't see how you can get away from that unless you stay way out of town. I would definitely stay here again. I am a regular traveller to Barcelona and this is the best of the hotels I have stayed in for the price. Oh and as an added extra you can use the internet easily and freely. Review #46:Stayed twice at the Regina within the space of 10 days (pre and post cruise)and found its location at the top of the Ramblas and next to Catalunya Square to be excellent for shopping,buses,taxis and general sightseeing. Despite other peoples experiences with the staff we found them to be efficient and helpful BUT you get what you put in so maybe a bit of courtesy towards them would pay dividends when you want early check ins and somewhere to hold your cases after you checkout or taxis,information etc. Anyway down to the Hotel itself the Public areas are pleasant and well kept there is a small free internet cafe.The breakfasts looked good but we did not have any as they are pricey and you can just wander out and go to nearby cafes anyway. The room themselves were probably chic/fashionable/minimalist when it opened 10/12 years ago but now whilst they are clean and functional they are worn around the edges and like the towels slightly frayed.I would also agree with other reviewers that the sound insulation is poor. We stayed in a large family room with our two young children and have no issues with it as we got a good rate, just take the online pictures with a pinch of salt. I do not know how the Hotel rating system works but this is a 3 star not 4 star Hotel. Would we stay there again yes, but not for more than a couple of days. Review #47:I stayed here for 4 nights when I came for a trade show and fortunately, as I was here for business, didn't stay in the room or hotel very much. I actually made a booking at Pulitzer Hotel, which is the sister hotel of Regina, and literally next door. But he Pulitzer was full, so they booked me a room at the Regina instead. The best things I would say is the fantastic location of the hotel, which is a short walk to Ramblas or Paseo de Gracia, with great shopping. The other good things are the reasonable rate of the hotel and the impressive lobby, which feels like a grand old hotel. However, once you pass the lobby and go towards the rooms, you come to a tiny lift (only one lift!) so be prepared to wait and if there are 2 of you with luggage, its a tight squeeze. Then the rooms ... you start to feel the age and tiredness of the rooms when you step in. Room size is also on the small side. Opt for rooms in the front, at least you'll have a window. My room was at the back and there was a tiny window in the corner, facing a brick wall. Can be depressing if you don't walk out of the hotel to look at the sky. If you need a drink, its better to walk next door to the Bar at the Pulitzer, which seems more civilized and lively. Personally, I wouldn't come back to stay here as there are so many other great choices in Barcelona. For a similar location and type of hotel, I would probably opt for Pulitzer or Jazz Hotel next time. Review #48:Just back from a superb stay at the Hotel Regina. The hotel could not be any more central or better located than it is from both La Ramblas and the shopping. The hotel is beautiful, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms great, slightly small but perfect for what we needed. Cleaned everyday and central heating was great. Have been recommending the hotel already! Still cannot believe the price we paid for the location and the quality. Overall had an excellent stay and will definately be back. Review #49:Perfect location - just off Placa de Catalunya, right at the heart of Barcelona. Room was small but very clean and tastefully furnished (although lacking a full size mirror). Very comfortable bed. A functional modern bathroom. Free internet in the lounge area. Breakfast - buffet style, varied, good quality food. We recommend this hotel. with confidence. Review #50:The Hotel Regina was almost perfect. The staff members were extremely helpful and very polite. The hotel itself is quite beautiful inside. The decor is in dark, earthy colors, giving it a warm and cozy feeling. Everything is extremely clean. In comparison to the rest of the hotel, the room was a bit disappointing. We had booked a double room and though immaculate, it was very cramped. The minimalist decor would have been better if everything hadn't been just black and white. As there were construction works going on outside the hotel, the room's window provided us with absolutely no natural light. This made the room seem very dark even in the middle of the day. It did make for a good night's sleep though. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was good. There was something for everyone. The breakfast room staff didn't speak English which proved to be difficult for some people. I speak Spanish but my friend didn't, so when I came down for breakfast my friend was struggling to explain to the staff member that coffee had run out in the decanter. Funny for me, maybe not so much for others. If you're staying with friends or family this is a good hotel to stay at. The location is excellent and the staff is really nice. If this is a romantic getaway, then I would recommend staying somewhere else. Tiniest bathtub ever! Review #51:I would rate the Hotel Regina much closer to a three-star than a four-star property. It's obvious that they've undergone some renovations (lobby and bar area are nicely furnished), but a coat of paint and updated IKEA furnishings do not a four star property make. The location of the hotel is excellent -- great things w/in walking distance and one-half block from the Metro. The common areas (especially the hallways) are right out of a 1970's B-movie set: cheap carpet, wood-panel doors, institutional color palette, etc. The amenities are limited and cheap (no soap for the shower?). The sinks (there were 2 sinks in our room) were located as part of the living/sleeping area (common layout for European and Asian hotels). One of our sinks was perpetually clogged. We notified the front desk of this problem but they failed to correct it during our 3 night stay. Although there was plenty of hot water for the shower, because the glass \"door\" extended along only one-third the length of the bathtub, the result was a very drafty shower. There was an itty bitty balcony with our room w/ enough space for two people to stand upright (but certainly no sitting) that had a very nice view of the \"Triangle,\" the area just beyond Placa Catalunya. The hotel is woefully understaffed. There was no doorman or porter/bellhop so we were left to our own struggles to get our many bags through the front door and up the stairs to the aging (and SMALL) elevator. They had a business centre w/ free and fast internet access but we did occasionally have issues w/ WiFi from the room. Generally, an adequate hotel, but doesn't live up to other Spanish (including Barcelona) four star properties. Review #52:srcit76 Wilmington, DE Based on recommendations found here we stayed two nights prior to a cruise. No regrets.The location, on a quiet street with it's proximity to the Placa de Catalunya, La Ramblas and restaurants was perfect. Our room, facing the street on the fifth floor was very clean and the beds comfortable. Excellent lighting to read in bed but no so at the desk. The only negative was a leaky shower door that puddled water on the floor. A very friendly and helpful staff. We would stay here again. (Note: The floor plan posted on the door did show some rooms to be quite small. Those facing the street are much larger). Review #53:Rooms were small but had everything we needed. We traveled with another couple, and our room was twice the size of theirs. The computer lounge was nice. The proximity to Plaza de Catalunya and Las Ramblas is perfect. You are paying for the location. Close to metro, 15 minute ride to beach, you need to switch trains once. I would recommend this hotel. Review #54:I have stayed for four nights at this fabulous hotel . The hotel is located just 1 minutes walk from the Plaza Catalunya square and the metro station. The easiest way to get to the hotel from the airport is using the Aerobus shattle, it's a direct bus from the airport to the city center, the last station is the Plaza Catalunya square, it's cost only 8 euro for a retorn ticket that valid up to 9 days. Tha hotel staff wad so delightful and they were always willing to help answer my questions or provide recommendations. The room was very clean and comfort with a free WIFI, a air-condition and even a bathrobe and slippers, it's was so nice to came back to the room after a long day out. Review #55:We had an excellent stay for a long weekend in Barcelona. Location: Very convenient for the major atrractions and the Bus Turistic which picks up from Placa del Cataluyna. Also in a lovely area to walk to local restaurants etc. Rooms: Clean, classy and well laid out, we were not bothered by the noise of other guests or outside. The only thing was the faint rumbling of the occasional underground train. There is also a free internet lounge. Staff: Excellent and only too happy to help, they went out of their way to help when my husband was ill. The also organised our departure. In summary, we highly recommend the Hotel Regina for your next stay in Barcelona! Review #56:My mom and I stayed at a twin room at Hotel Regina in mid April. We picked this hotel for its location and we weren't disappointed. Everything was either walking or subway ride away, subway station was definitely less than 5 minutes walk away. The staff was OK but they sure made us wait when checking in (previous group was large and took forever). The room was rather small (we got room 211). I think we were facing the back side of the hotel but couldn't tell too well because there was only one tiny, narrow window facing walls with hardly any light coming in. The lighting in the room was fine, so we didn't feel all that bad, but a view would have been nice. We did hear some subway noise during the day time, but that didn't wake us up early or anything. Also, the room was kept quite warm, so we didn't even need the blankets when trying to sleep. The bonus was free access to 3 computers at business center-I wasn't expecting it, so it was nice to have. And there was a little supermarket right across the street, which made it easy for us to buy water and other snack items. Overall, I thought the hotel was clean, modern looking and in a great central location. Ideally, the room could have been bigger and with more natural light, but for busy travelers just needing a place to sleep, it was very nice. Review #57:Sorry I am taking so long to review this hotel after my stay in March 2010. I will preface this review by saying that I live in Europe and have stayed in hundreds of hotels in the region. I'm accustomed to small rooms, and I think I'm a reasonable reviewer of hotels. I don't require top-notch luxury if I'm not paying a lot of money. But I have to say this was the worst room I've had in a highly rated TripAdvisor hotel and a terrible experience given the amount of money we spent for the room. After seeing other reviewers' photos, I see that perhaps my experience was unusual, but be warned that it could be you next time. Granted, we chose the least expensive room when booking, but even the least expensive room at this rate should have been better. My girlfriend and I checked in late and after waiting 15 minutes for the front desk employee to get off the phone, we were given a terribly small, dark, depressing, windowless room. I say windowless, but it actually did have a tiny high window that opened a little into a crawlspace/alley that was perpetually dark. The room itself was stark with the bed taking up almost the entire space. The bathroom was equally unimpressive. We asked immediately for a room change, but the front desk employee said that no others were available that night. He said he would switch the room in the following day or two. Every day we checked back, but to no avail. The only positive I can say about the hotel was that the entry way and common areas were nicely designed in a modern style. And it had a good location for touring. But we wanted nothing to do with the hotel and strived to be out as much as possible. I do not recommend that you choose this hotel. Review #58:We spent Easter time at hotel Regina with children. It has great location, only few steps from Rambla and Plaza Catulunya and that's why we chose this hotel. Staff and also interior of the hotel is nice but we were little bit disapointed from family room. We had family room on the 4th floor and it was not very spacious and comfortable. But every other things were ok... Review #59:We stayed here a day early prior to leaving on a Mediterranean Cruise. We had heard bad things about Barcelona hotel and were not sure what to expect. We were greeted by exceptionally helpful and friendly staff. Every one we came in contact with spoke English except for the bartender. Our lost luggage was tracked down by staff members and delivered to our room when it arrived. Our room had a king size bed, beautiful bathroom and a sitting room. Very clean with all the amenities. The only bad thing I could say was noise from the hallway filtered into the room quite a bit. As it was pouring rain we decided to eat in the bar area. The food was fantastic and the service was quick and efficient. The hotel location is a very short walking distance to the Ramblas. A great cultural and good shopping experience. Review #60:excellent location, central. top of las ramblas, close to all public transport including train, underground and buses. definitely 4 stars and also rooms of high quality. Good service too. In summary, value for money, quality, great location - what more do you need in a hotel for a city break Review #61:I normally stay in the Pulitzer hotel next door which is a sister hotel and represents far better value for money than Regina which is really showing its age. Locataion is great for either business or tourists so that is a major plus but the regina is not as good value as the Pulitzer. Rooms and public spaces are definitely very tired and room service menu is very limited (no restaurant) - breakfast was decent but due to a conference in town at the time the cost for my room was prohibitively expensive Review #62:I ended up with a reservation at this hotel instead of its sister property, Hotel Pulitzer (right next door). So, watch the website link you are taken to...to ensure you're reserving at your preferred property. The accommodations at Hotel Regina were fine though it does lack luster in terms of decor. The room I had was simple and not one to 'hang-out' in. It served as a home base and for sleeping primarily. The excellent room rate obtained was due to the room being located just over an underground transportation line that didn't shut down until about midnight and would start up about 6:00a.m. the following morning. I was so tired from jetlag and being on the go, that the first few nights...this didn't bother me. But over the 8 nights of my stay, there were a couple nights when it was a bit annoying. Overall, the room was clean, and desk staff were helpful. There was no breakfast included with my room rate. Review #63:Really nice hotel. The room was a bit on the small side, but the fixtures were new and stylish. The minibar had decent prices for that, and the wireless internet was free. The location, 50 meters from the Plaza Catalunya was unbeatable. From there you can access a major Metro station and the cheap (5 euro) bus to the airport from the front of El Corte Ingles department store. The Rambla is right outside your door, major Gaudi edifices are a short walk away. My buddy found the location noisy and found it hard to sleep, but I didn't notice. We got the room for about $150 a night. I say it was a major deal. Review #64:Surly check in clerk. Air con did not work despite complaining twice. Not one good nights sleep in 3 night stay due to non existent sound proofing between rooms and corridor. If you like the sound of slamming doors, stay here, otherwise spend your euros more wisely. 2nd attempt to review this hotel so hopefully this one will get shown! Review #65:We stayed at Hotel Regina for 2 nights just last weekend. Location was excellent and close to everything. Our room was spacious, very clean and quite (considering we were right off the main shopping area). The staff were helpful and friendly. I will definitley be returning to Barcelona and with that will be returning to the Hotel Regina. Review #66:We spent 6 nights at the Hotel Regina, and chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. It was not as good as we had expected it to be, mainly because we were given a poor quality room. Pros: Excellent location next to Placa Catalunya - easy walk to Las Ramblas/the beach/all transport links and aerobus etc Comfortable beds and quiet room which was clean Free wifi Nice, relaxing bar area with very helpful waiter who fed us free crisps etc when we were having wine Bathrobes and slippers provided in rooms (both huge) Cons: We were given a very small, cramped room. There was no view from the window (see photo)and no sunlight into the room. We couldn't tell what the weather was like from our room. Despite asking for a non-smoking room, our room smelt strongly of stale cigarette smoke and other people's smoke came through the air conditioning into our room. No kettle to make a cup of tea No iron/board in room - although staff did provide us with this on request. Safety of iron questionable (see photo) Didn't always replace toiletries in room Reception staff variable in terms of helpfulness. Our room phone didn't work and wasn't fixed during our stay. Small shower-room, with water from shower escaping onto floor. Overall, if you are looking for a no-frills, central hotel close to all transport links, then Hotel Regina is probably worth considering. If you like a bit of luxury on your holiday, probably best avoided. In our view, not worthy of its four star status and more like a three star. Review #67:We had an overnight in Barcelona before the start of our NCL cruise. We chose the Hotel Regina for its location a block from Placa Catalunya and the start of Las Ramblas. When we checked in, they gave us a superior room, which had plenty of space for the two of us with double beds and a then a couch in an alcove area. The room and large bathroom were clean and orderly. The breakfast buffet had a wide variety of options although the restaurant is not clearly marked, You had to walk through a doorway by the bar and then go pass the toilets to find it. The one negative comment would be that the space between the beds and the wall unit did not allow for luggage to be rolled through. I had to lift them over the beds to get to the other side. It was only a few blocks to the Gothic area and the two wonderful churches there, the Cathedral and Santa Maria del Mar. The Hard Rock is right on Placa Catalunya as well. We walked from the Hotel to the end of Las Ramblas to catch the cruise terminal shuttle right across from the Columbus monument. (olny took 30 minutes and that was with stopping at a few shops along the way) We would not hesitate going to this hotel again. Review #68:We had a group of four of us - no couples - so really appreciated the \"family room\" we were able to get here (for a reasonable price). It was very spacious and clean and had a big bathroom and lots of room to spread out. Sadly we only stayed one night but we had excellent service from the very friendly staff. We asked a lot of questions for getting around Barcelona and they were extremely helpful. They also have a room (and great organization) where you can lock your bags up securely if needed (we checked out but were not heading to our cruise ship until late in the day). One reason we chose this hotel was the location but we did worry about the noise - there was no need to! It was quiet even with the location so close to Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas! I would definitely stay here again! Oh and the beds were quite comfortable! Review #69:Last year we went to Barcelona because we were going on a cruise. Checked the reviews about this hotel and did not regret choosing it. Very close to the Rambla, restaurants and some shopping, and bus stations. There is a Corte Ingles walking distance. Very clean and comfortable beds. Review #70:hotel is clean, the service is fine although variable. We stayed in a large room, well equipped with a spacious bathroom and bedroom. Dont use the rooms near the triangle especially 1st floor-the trains rumble the floor regardless if your windows are shut. dont use the laundry service unless your willing to part with more money than your clothes are worth. Overall-depends on what deal you got for your room, because despite the cons the location is very convenient. Review #71:What a gem of a hotel, so close to everything and such large rooms. Such good value for money and the little extras are so sweet, there are dressing gowns and new slippers awaiting in the bathroom and even lady and gentleman packs, for those little bits you might have forgotten. The hotel itself could do with lighter decoration as there are always lights on due to a lot of dark wood but that is a small price to pay. The staff are very smiley and extremely courteous, very accomodating and friendly. Well done, customer service at its best. Thank you. Review #72:We stayed at Regina for 3 nights after a Mediterranean cruise. The staff was excellent specially Carmen. It's location is fantastic, just a couple of blocks away from las /Ramblas, but you don't have the noisy of the crowd of Las Ramblas. However with the rooms, they are very closed to each other and at night when you come back to restetimes you can hear the conversations and noises from your neighboors. Also the doors don't close normally, you have to bang them to get them properly closed. This is really a problem, because after 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning you can hear these noices from guest leaving the hotel and you feel they are happening in your own room.Before our cruise we stayed for 2 nights at another 2 stars guesthouse, and didnot have to confront this situation.In all this is the only complaint we have, an very honest not good for what we paid. Jose L. Perez (stayed from 10-10-10 th. 10-13-10 Review #73:Have just returned from a 2 night stay, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The location of this hotel is perfect. It's right in the centre of the city, so a perfect starting point to explore. And also very easy to get back to - all types of transport are right outside. From the moment we arrived, the staff were very helpful and efficient. The room was an unusual shape but an acceptable size. The beds were comfy. Our only complaint was being located right next to the infamous housekeeping cupboard, and therefore heard every door open and close as the staff went about their work in the early hours. To be fair, we didn't mention this to management, as we were only there for 2 nights and didn't want the hassle of changing our room. The staff were very helpful in letting us store our luggage after checking out, for nearly a whole day. Also, no free wine or chocolates in the room, as others have noted. We felt safe and secure in and outside the hotel at all times, which was nice, being 2 females. I would recommend this hotel highly. Review #74:Our son had to be hospitalized. We were in US & didn't speak language. Andrea, Alberto, and Rafael were unbelievable - translating with hospital, assisting in middle of night when he returned. They went above & beyond without hesitation. My son says the hotel is beautiful & great location. Review #75:Thank you to Mr. Sanchez for accommodating all our requests - room with balcony, early check-in, non-smoking floor. Since we also informed him that it was our anniversay, he had a bottle of Cava and chocolate covered pistachios in the room when we arrived - very classy and thoughtful touch. Thank you again. Wonderful, charming front desk staff - very helpful, friendly and well informed - most especially Raffa and Manuel. Suggested great restaurants - Cinc Sentits, Espai Sucre (dessert place), and Olive - all exquisite cuisine in the new Spanish style plus a couple of more traditional ones - Cal Pep and Cerveceria Catalunya (which we all went to and recommend highly) he also let us know what to avoid as tourist traps - helpful information anywhere you travel. Perhaps the noise problem has been addressed since talking and other noise from cleaning staff was kept to a minimum and did not bother us at all. There were double windows on the balcony which overlooked the street and so no noise penetrated from outside either. The rooms are clean, well-kept, well-stocked and had more than adequate space for two people. The bed was comfortable (as they say, when travelling, it is all about the bed) and afforded us several good nights' sleep after a long day of exploring. The hotel is centrally located between the old town (Rambla, Born and Barrio Gothic) and the new areas (Eixample) but on a quiet street. Getting to either place was so easy since all transportation was just half a block away (including the airport bus) on Plaza Catalunya, although I think Barcelona is a walking town and we highly recommend doing this. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff is very responsive and will address any of your questions and concerns in a very professional but friendly manner. Review #76:Very good hotel located in a quiet street less than 100 m form piazza Cataluna and the metro stop, and walking distance to the Ramblas. Spacious rooms, very good amenities. Friendly and helpful staff specially Luis at the front desk. I recommend this hotel. Review #77:Our first trip to Barcelona and I chose the Hotel Regina for our stay. From the initial communication with the hotel's gracious manager, Jos\u00e9 M\u00aa Sanchez, through our checkout, the experience was outstanding. The property is located just off the Placa Catalunya which provides VERY easy access from the airport. Hop on the A-1 bus (blue) and in just minutes you are there walking a short distance to the hotel (look for the blue banner on the side of the building). Having arrived in the morning I was quite pleased after the long flight that our room was available upon arrival and check-in was very pleasant and efficient. Our 5th floor room was spacious, contemporary and very comfortable (pictures posted) and the bathroom was good sized. As previously reported here, the bedding is very comfortable. The location of rhe property is fantastic for visiting the city sites as it is an easy walk to the historic areas and La Rambla. Also, the Bus Turistic (hop on hop off service) launches from the Placa Catalunya so gettting around the city from the hotel is very, very easy. We found each staff person at the hotel eager to help, very knowledgeable and very friendly. Our travels brought us back to Barcelona for the night before our flight home and we were happy to return to the Hotel Regina for our last night. The room we had this time was an interior room and was much smaller than our initial room but was comfortable and met our needs for the night. I don't know when our travels might bring us back to Barcelona but when we return, I happily know I have a home away from home in Barcelona. Review #78:Stayed at the Hotel Regina again this year and was not disappointed. Great service and a surprise welcome back gift of Champagne and Chocolates. I do not know if they do this for everyone, not that I'm special, but a neat surprise. The entire staff went over backwards to make our stay excellent. Review #79:Hotel Regina is well situated just off the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas, but close enough. Staff was very professional and helpful. We had a very late flight the evening of our check-out and they took care of our 4 large suitcases until we were ready to leave. Beds were comfortable and bathroom toiletries were well appointed, including robes and slippers. The sink in the room was not the best idea in the floor plan. Overall, a good hotel. Many options for breakfast near by since hotel breakfast was overpriced. The rooms could use some refurbishing as wear and tear can be seen. Not a very big deal though. Review #80:My family of 4 stayed in a family room for 3 nights from 8th October. The room was very large and clean with very comfortable beds. The position of the hotel was excellent as it is situated just around the corner from Plaza Catalunya with all the transport faciities and restaurants on the doorstep. On arrival we found that my daughter had left her mobile phone in the taxi ... but i would like to thanks the hotel staff for their help and consideration as they offered and helped us with trying to get the phone back. (Thankfully, we did manage to contact the finder and get it back). We did not have breakfast at the hotel as the price of 16 euros per person seemed expensive (a family of 4 costing 64 euros). However, there were plenty of places close by which were great for breakfast at reasonable value. The hotel went to great lengths to ensure that we had a great stay for our Wedding anniversary. Thank you Mr Sanchez .. we loved your hotel and your kind hospitality and I would certainly stay there again when we return and would recommend it to others. Thanks ! Review #81:My daughter and I stayed here on a sight seeing trip to Barcelona. We found the Hotel to be centrally located, easy access to Catalunya Square, from where you can visit most of the tourist sites. Our room, was large, good bathroom, only downside was that it faced buildings at the back of the Hotel. No view. Room was clean and adequately furnished for a few days stay. Bedside rug did need a good steam clean!! Trendy looking, comfortable bar, though on a Monday night this was very, very, quiet. After leaving for the airport, we discovered we'd left a mobile phone in the bedroom. On contacting Reception from the airport, we luckily heard it had been found and would be posted back to us. It arrived safe and sound 2 weeks later. Many, many thanks to those concerned at Reception. Would recommend this Hotel, but ask for a room with a view and a little iron balcony. Review #82:Since we already found a quad room at Saint James Albany Hotel in Paris, I wanted to get another one in Barcelona, Spain. And I found it at the Regina Hotel. The location is conveniently located without the noise of Las Ramblas but walking distance to everything else. It was the perfect location. It even had white bathrobes for the four of us. I felt like I was in the privacy of my own home. Talk about making you feel at \"home!\" Try to find out which days they have a discount and plan your trip around it if your dates are flexible. Their breakfast is not included in the room rates but be adventurous and eat out. It's also cheaper to eat the breakfast buffet outside. Barcelona is a party city. You can't be bored here. People are very friendly. The hotel staff was so accommodating with our requests. They will do everything they can to help you with your questions. I'd strongly recommend this hotel especially if there's 4 of you and you want to share the cost. You will have the time of your life here. Also, don't forget to eat your churros with hot choclate or you'll be sorry. We wondered if there's a buffet for dinner in Barcelona and yes there is. If you love meat....it's a feast! And sangria accompanies every meal. You will love this place. Don't miss Monserrat up in the mountains. Just take the train and ask the hotel staff how to get there. Be careful with the pickpocketers. They can spot the tourists who wears their shorts. Review #83:Location is fabulous! Get the aerobus from the airport and the hotel is literally a few minutes walk from Place Catalunya (head for the street with Habitat on the corner). Our room was small but very clean and well decorated. Bathrobes and slippers were provided and the toiletries were very good. We booked direct with the hotel and I advised them that it was my husband's 40th birthday - on our first night, a complimentary bottle of Cava was delivered to our room! This was a total surprise and such a lovely gesture - thank you Hotel Regina! The reception staff were also very helpful when we made enquiries about the Metro system. I wouldnt even consider looking for another hotel in Barcelona Review #84:We stayed at the Hotel Regina for two nights after returning to Barcelona on our cruise ship. The best part about this hotel is location, location, location... The hotel is located a half-block from the central Plaza Cataluna (spelling ?) and one block from the Las Ramblas district. A subway station, the Aero bus stop (direct to Barcelona airport) and the multi-story Corte de Ingles department store are at the plaza. Located on a side street, the hotel avoids much of the street noise common to other hotels in the area. Our 5th floor room was spacious, clean and had a small balcony overlooking the street. We appreciated the 5 computers which were available for use by guests. The hotel's full-service bar also served delicious tapas and small plate options. A breakfast buffet -- available for about 13 euros ($17 US) -- offered a nice array of food and beverage options. There was no valet service -- at least no one offered to help us move 2 large bags from the sidewalk to our room. The front desk staff spoke good English and made several useful suggestions on where to eat and where to go. Given its central location, this hotel provides an excellent value for travelers. Not an especially romantic setting. Review #85:We stayed at the Regina for two nights in late June. We had a double room, (2 beds), our children and grandchildren had a quad room (4 beds). The hotel is right off Plaza Catalyuna and the main thoroughfare Las Ramblas. It was quiet (except for the night that Spain won the world cup), the rooms were modern, clean and beautiful. Bathrooms were crisp and clean. The complimentary bathrobes were a plus. Their small bar is quiet and perfect to relax in after a day of sightseeing. They will arrange for sandwiches and small meals upon request. The internet is free, with 3 provided computers. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, answering our questions and providing taxi calls and restaurant recommendations. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms fairly large. Although not inexpensive, it compares very favorably with any 4 star hotel in New York City...indeed the rooms are larger and cleaner. We would be happy to use this hotel again. Review #86:The room was simple but comfortable for the four of us (two teenagers 15 and 13). The beds were GREAT!!! The room temperature perfect. The room was clean. At night, it was quiet even though we were footsteps from loud Las Ramblas Street. It was an ideal location. Starbucks around the corner.........Las Ramblas around the other corner.........Hop on Hop off tour bus a block away. Close to restaurants, shopping and sight seeing. Quick cab ride to the ship - it was perfect for our needs. Would recommend without hesitation. Review #87:Good location right at the top of ramblas. The staff were very dismissive, but I think that was the language barrier because they had very poor English and tourist skills!, Not much else to say really! Try somewhere else if you want good help with touristy stuff. Review #88:We stayed for 4 nights in August for first time Barcelona tourism, which entitled to us to a long stay discount (probably regarded as quite expensive otherwise). The location is very good - Passeig de Gracia where the renfe trains from airport connects is very close, and perfectly located by the Placa Catalunya for walkable access to both the new town (for Gaudi architectures) and the old town (for catedral and la rambra) and restaurants are great. Staff were capable of speaking English but occasionally difficult to communicate - otherwise very friendly and helpful. Good selection was provided for breakfast and the fact that it was available from 7-12 was very handy. 3 computers available in the lounge for free access to internet was useful too. The rooms were generally modern, simple and clean, and the beds were comfortable but quite small and bathrooms were somewhat moldy... Something I wouldn't have expected from four star hotel. We were also allocated a disabled facilitated room which was more inconvenient to get around, let alone it was already small, because of the extra handles etc. Also beware of the thin walls - you can hear the people next door and the movements in the corridor. Good enough if you just need a comfortable bed to sleep in after a long day of walking, Review #89:Stayed here for one night at the end of a 3 week trip to Spain. Staff at the reception desk were helpful with any requests or questions. However, I had booked a double room in advance, and confirmed it was a double at check-in, but when I got to the room, it was a twin. When I phoned reception to see what was going on, they told me that a booking for a double room is only treated as a REQUEST for a double. Huh??? Hotel Regina & I obviously have different concepts of what a confirmed booking is. They did find a double room for me, so it was all fine after that. Free internet access in the business centre near the hotel bar was great. Overall, I don't have any complaints about the hotel, but nor is it one I would rave about. Perfectly adequate sums it up. Review #90:I had heard not to expect much from the hotels in Europe. Well I can tell you that is not the case with the Hotel Regina. Renting the Superior room was as good as any in America. The rooms were spacious with king sized bed; new and modern baths; remodeled rooms; very relaxing lobby bar and great location...Just a block off of the Rambles. And, not a horrible price. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona. Review #91:A friend of mine and I stayed at the Hotel Regina for 3 days in August. The rooms were clean and spacious (something unexpected after we had just come from Paris). The best part of the hotel may be the location. It's a block away from Placa Catalyuna (where the Aerobus is located), shopping, and Las Ramblas. If you don't have to pay full price for a room (we used a expedia vacation package and got it for cheap) then it might be one of the best deals in Barcelona! Review #92:As with previous reviews, the location was great. RIght off of La Rambla, close to shopping (el Corte Ingles) and the metro. The staff and service was all great. We had a triple room and it was beautiful, modern...but the bathroom was a real dissappoinment. A hotel of this caliber (and price) I would have liked a nicer bathroom/shower. The tub/shower door was so short that the minute you turned on the shower, water gets all over the bathroom. Plus, the rubber seal at the bottom the short shower door was nonexistant so water would hit the glass and go right out all over the floor. It was no wonder there was a drain in the middle of the bathroom floor and 2 shower mats provided! I'm positive it wasn't user error as you can see mold growing along the edges of the bathroom floor. Considering the price we paid per night...this was a real dissappoinment and I can only rate it average. Review #93:Stayed in the hotel for one night for sightseeing in Barcelona. Room 220 spacious, big bed seperate area with day bed/3rd bed. Immaculate bathroom, bathrobes etc. & soooo quiet. Dare I have a tiny complaint, diffuculty getting BBC World on the plasma to catch up on the Credit news at home. Otherwise the Hotel scored 11 out of 10 Review #94:We stayed at the Regina during 2 nights for a week-end getaway for my 45th birthday early Sept. In all, this hotel is OK and what you would expect of a 4 star city hotel. Nothing special but nice design. Husband, myself and our teenage daughter shared a 'family room'. It was spacious and nicely decorated with modern dark wood furniture. We were pleasantly surprised that we did not hear the traffic - the hotel is located right in the middle at the top of La Rambla and therefore quite a lot of traffic noise. However, inside, the hotel is very poorly insulated. We were unlucky to have the cleaner's cupboard just outside our room and at 07:00 in the morning we heard everything they did and said ... very annoying! There is a 1.5 cm gap under the door which makes anything said in the corridor like if said inside your room. While fully equipped with bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, towels etc for 3 people (which is good, you usually have to remind housekeeping of the third person), we thought the bathroom was very small and the double sink next to the bed was weird. Since the bathroom/room obviously had been remodelled, it would have been better to move the wall across and include the sinks within the bathroom. We enjoyed Barcelona very much. Beautiful city with lots to do and see for a week-end getaway and warm temperatures still in September. We even spent an afternoon on the beach. The sister hotel Pulitzer next door has a much nicer bar. Can be recommended. We'll probably stay at the Pulitzer next time. Review #95:I wanted to visit Barcelona for my Birthday weekend and as such researched a whole range of different hotels in the city. I was very impressed when I saw on the tripadvisor that the Manager of 'Hotel Regina' personally answers every review, and from looking at the hotel website decided to get into contact. All my questions were answered quickly and efficiently, which left no doubt in my mind that I wanted to stay there. On arrival, everything that I had requested was in place and the room we had been given was truly excellent, with a balcony overlooking the square. The hotel itself is in a fantastic location, just a minutes walk from the top of La Ramblas and all it has to offer. Inside, the hotel feels very modern, with nice interior design and lightning, it's certainly impressive. But what really struck me was the service, nothing seemed like too much trouble, staff were always smiling and willing to help. Ontop of all this, on the morning we were set to leave (my Birthday), the staff sent a Birthday cake to our room - Such a touch of class and something that really made a great start of the day for me - Thank you so much to all involved! Next time I go to Barcelona I will definately be staying in the Hotel Regina, I have never before experienced such high quality service and surroundings. Review #96:Great hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. Perfect location at one end of the Ramblas (Metro Catalunya). The service was great, the room was made ready and available before check-in time, breakfast was very nice. Truly a four star hotel (quality levels may vary among four-star hotels unfortunately). Free internet and print service in the lobby (in the other hotel, Royam Ramblas, we had to pay! ), nice bar also in the lobby. Cleanliness scored four out of five as the carpet in the hall /corridor had a few spots, but the room was large and cosy (we had a standard double) and TV had a nice selection of international / EU channels (but also CNN). We also went for the Romantic package and for 20 EUR we got breakfast for two and a bottle of Cava, it was really worth it. Breakfast was downstairs in the breakfast room so we had a full bufet not just a limited eat-in version. Cava was served the night before in the room. The swimming pool was closed for repair, but hey, we had the sea! Overall an excellent impression and I really regret that we were not able to spend all of our stay there (previous booking in another hotel). I highly recommend Regina. Review #97:From the moment I walked into this hotel I experienced excellent service. The check in process was quick and friendly with plenty of staff behind the desk. The room was of a good size and had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. One small negative was the sink, which was located in the room rather than the bathroom. The TV didn\u2019t work and when this was reported to the front desk it was remedied immediately. Drinks taken in the hotel bar are a pleasure, with friendly bar staff that can mix cocktails and long drinks with skill and a smile; nothing is too much for them. The hotel is located at the top of Las Ramblas and next to the main shopping district where all the top names have stores. I have stayed in some of the worlds top hotels and this will always sit in my top 5. Review #98:My husband and I stayed at the Regina for three nights in November. We were on our way to Barcelona by car when we were robbed. When we arrived at the hotel we told the staff at the front desk what happened and they were immediately helpful. They found the phone number and directions to the Canadian consulate and also walked us to the police station so that we could report the incident. They also upgraded us to a suite at no extra charge. Our room was very clean and big. The location was excellent right next to Placa Catalunia. Plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. The hotel also has a great bar and a bartender that makes a mean martini. Review #99:This hotel can probably go both ways depending on the person. For me, I appreciated the 1916 era architecture right away at least. The location is quite good for access to La Rambla and the old castle part of the town, about a 15 minute walk down to the seaside. The only negative aspect that I encountered was the 'thinness' of the walls, on the first day I was there I noticed I could here every source of music and loud conversation on the floor (1st floor). Luckily, any noise that did seep into the room was completely cancelled out by the unbelievably comfortable bed and bedding... I was pretty shocked by it at first, as I did not think a hotel bed would ever qualify that highly for such a price (I've stayed in a LOT of king beds at hotels all over the place and they so far have never been exceptionally mentionable). I was also suspicious that the comfort was proportional only to my exhaustion, but this proved to be unrelated during the three nights I spent there. So yes, nobody should go to Barcelona to hang out in hotel rooms anyways, so if you need a place to stay that is mid-range, I highly recommend the Regina!", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Took a little time to actually find the hotel but when we did we were met with a friendly and efficient check in. Had a great room on the 6th floor- all our requirements were met - we had requested direct with the hotel that we had a room on the top floor, non smoking, away from the elevator and a bath and shower - oh and a king size bed. Slight road noise at night but that is the only negative. Fabulous breakfast spread - including chocolate - a first I must say - and delicious too. The breakfast room is lovely and bright and again great serving staff. Also found a fantastic restaurant around the corner - called Lagrantasca I think. Ate there 3 times in 4 days - greedy or what. Staff again were great and food and ambience very nice. Review #1:I read some of the reviews with heart pounding horror - we'd already booked Hotel America. However, it's a very nice hotel, understanding staff, good breakfast and the rooms are what you'd expect - they even gave us bath robes which was a bonus (I'm easily pleased!). The 'bar' is on the small side - OK, it's minute. And hardly comfortable, so the hotel should be considered a room for the night not a place to get socialising. It's one stop away from the Rambles and one night we had to get a cab back as the metro was closed. For this reason only I'd have picked another hotel more in the 'heart' of the city. But if you don't want to pay over the odds, want somewhere comfortable this is the place for you. Oh, we booked via TravelRepublic - that's a great site with the best deals I've found. And, believe me, I look! Review #2:Stayed at the Hotel America Barcelona for 3 nights from the 16th December 2005. The hotel is clean, friendly and well situated yet far enough away from the lively La Ramblas to get a good nights sleep. The breakfast is great and at Euro 14 if not included in your rate is good value for what is available on the buffet. Ask for a high room at the back of the hotel, because although the view is not great it keeps you away from the road. The staff at the hotel are great and speak good english which if you do not speak spanish makes things so much easier. Took a taxi both ways from the airport cost Euro 25 each way, but make sure you put your seat belt on because no driver in Barcelona takes any prisoners. Barcelona is a great place to visit with lots to do and I would recommend the bus tours which have 3 routes ( 2 in winter) which covers all the main attractions with ease. This hotel is a good base for a visit to a interesting city. Review #3:Just returned from a 4 night stay in the Hotel America. We had a fantastic time there. We booked 2 rooms as we travelled with my mother in law. Both rooms were ample in size. In our room, they had put a roll away bed in for our 3 year old son free of charge (I did request this prior to arrival). The rooms had all the usual benefits of a 4* hotel i.e. comfy beds, mini bar, safe, free toiletries, plasma tv. Our one minor complaint was that the rooms were very warm and the fan cooler didn't work. However, we didn't complain as it wasn't unbearable and I'm sure it would have been fixed straight away if we had reported it. The service of the staff was exceptional including reception, bar staff, restaurant staff and cleaners. Nothing was too much trouble. The buffet breakfast as detailed in previous reviews was great. It was one of the best we've had. Plenty of hot and cold choices. We were even given a glass of champagne for my wife's 30th birthday. The bar was nice although quite expensive. It was lovely to unwind at the end of a busy day with a beer or glass of wine. The bar area also had a computer with free internet access which was a nice bonus. Another real attraction of the hotel was the terrace. Although the pool was too cold, the jacuzzi was warm which our 3 yr old son enjoyed. The terrace also has lovely views across the city. The location of the hotel was ideal close to Rambla Catalunya and Paseig de Gracia. It was only 3 blocks from the Diagonal metro. It was a busy area but not too busy. There is a lovely restaurant/tapas bar next door to the hotel called Restaurante Mediteraneo. We had lovely tapas there which was always busy mainly with Spanish locals. (Highly recommended) Barcelona is our favourite city and when we return, we will definitely consider staying at the Hotel America. Review #4:Hotel America is not a bad choice if you're planning a trip to Barcelona. The staff was nice, especially the overnight receptionist. The pool are is nice also, though the hot tub is not very \"hot\" at all. We were there in September and the water was way too cold. The location is pretty good. You can't really walk to Las Ramblas, but the subway is easy to figure out. We got a rate of 100 euros per night on Expedia, and you definitely can't beat that! DVD players are available to rent for 10 euro a night. That was great b/c I found myself dying to hear some english and the only english channel is CNN. I definitely liked this hotel much better than our second hotel. We THOUGHT we wanted to be closer to Las Ramblas, so we switched to the H10 Catalunya for our last 3 nights there. BIG MISTAKE! The closer you get to the \"tourist area\", the hotels get more expensive, hotel rooms get smaller, and restaurants get more expensive. I'd definitely recommend Hotel America! Review #5:The service at this hotel is great - on par with luxury hotels we've stayed at (Peninsula, Four Seasons). Friendly, and considerate to a level exceeding expectation (e.g., I left a book on the night-table with a tissue marking the page and housekeeping left me a bookmark). The location was excellent - 2 blocks from P. de Catalunya - very convenient, but away enough that it was quiet and felt more relaxed (on St. George Day it was so crowded on P. de Catalunya that it would, literally, be difficult to exit your hotel onto the street if you were staying there). Considering people are out all hours in Barcelona, this is important if you want to sleep well. The rooms are fairly large compared to other European hotels we've stayed at. The rooms do need refreshing - the decor is dated, and in some cases the furniture is showing signs of wear. We booked based on online photos and were disappointed on seeing our room. Best thing: The service. Worst thing: Dated rooms. Review #6:Our three night stay at the America was excellent. The position is great, about five minutes walk from the Ramblas and Passeig de Gracia . It's very modern, not too large and extremely clean. Our room was a good size, bed very comfortable with plenty of storage space. Good bathroom with great variety of toiletries, hairdryer and magnifying mirror and huge towels plus towelling robe. Staff are all very friendly and there was always someone around if you needed them. The breakfasts were the best surprise - huge choice of everything plus plenty of exotic fresh fruit. Lovely bread and croissants and cakes! Bar area is filled with plenty of comfortable settees with free internet access plus plenty of guide books and others to browse through. Hotel umbrellas available too! Dinner recommendations were superb - there are lots of nice restaurants in the area which are not typically touristy. Although I didn't go to the roof I was told that the pool area was good. A good price and nice place to stay if you want to be away from the noisy end of the Ramblas. Also felt quite safe walking around with a handbag. Review #7:This is a nice hotel, the area is great with lots of nice restaurants and in walking distance of Passeig the Grazia and even better Rambla de Catalunya. The rooms are fine although a bit noisy. The rooftop terrace and pool are great. They have free internet in the lobby and a courtesy Fiat 500 for 4 hours during your stay which is great. Review #8:Having decided two days before New Year's Eve 2010 we were going to go to Barcelona to celebrate, we chose Hotel America from a list of available hotels with no other guidance whatsoever... But a fantastic choice it was!!! The stand out quality of this hotel is the service from the reception staff. Extremely helpful from the moment we got there (they booked tickets for a Barcelona football game for us and also were very helpful and sympathetic when one of our party had a bag stolen). The room we stayed in was very tidy and clean, bathroom the same. My only slight criticism would be the mattress was a bit hard for my liking and made my back ache but that is a purely personal thing. Maybe an extra pillow to, but if asked for, staff attended straight away. We also had to ask for some tea making equipment, which again was seen to promptly. We did not sample the breakfast in the hotel, instead opting to eat when out. Location of the hotel is good, well within walking distance of majority of sites and has good metro links; a station being just down the road. It is situated in a (normally) quiet area; there were roadworks outside the front of the hotel, this however not their fault. In summary, definitely worth a stay and I certainly would again!! ! Review #9:I visited Barcelona mid December and found the hotel was again to a good standard. The rooms are adequately sized, very clean, and my request prior to arriving for a room on a higher level was duly noted and a top floor room allocated. My only concern before arriving was the comments concerning road works in progress near to the hotel. These were in fact finished off on our last day staying there! I found the hotel to be relatively close to the main shopping streets in Barcelona, be it a 10/15 minute walk, though further away from past accommodation I've used in the city. However this hotel provides travellers with pleasant and helpful reception staff, good bar staff, useful welcome pack including maps and city guides, clean rooms, good and varied breakfast and most importantly in close proximity to the main city centre attractions. Overall another fantastic experience and would head back for my next visit to this beautiful city. Review #10:We had a brillant time in Barcelona, the hotel is really close to everything and the staff are so lovely, they really helped us out and were so friendly. Our room was huge, we booked a standard room on the third floor and it was great, we had a huge cornor view out over the street. The only let down was that the roof and pool werent open because of repairs, but we were there in January so it really didnt matter. I would absolutely go back to this hotel, its location, the room size and the staff made it a fantastic stay. Review #11:I had to go to Barcelona for business and had a tight budget due to the Euro being so high. I booked this hotel based on the reviews and was not disappointed. The service was good, the hotel rooms were spotless and everything seem fairly new. The downside was that I had a room near the elevator and I heard everything inside the hotel. The way the interior was set up; noise just bounces off the walls. The location wasn't too bad. It was not too far from the main areas such as Passage de Gracias; it was only a 5 - 10 minute walk; and probably about a 20 minute walk to the Ramblas. One night I was extremely tired and decided to just ask the hotel for a dinner recommendation (I usually never do this) and I regretted it. The front desk recommended Trobadero and the food just was not that good. I also don't recommend eating at the little Meditteranean bar next to the hotel. It's much better to go to the Boqueria during the day for lunch and go to Barceloneta for dinner. If would definitely stay here again. Review #12:we as a family were made very welcome the hotel was very clean staff very friendly and helpful we did not use roof top pool ,looks a bit small but fine for a dip on a hot day sauna was nice bar small but nice reception nice great hotel Review #13:We had a short break in Barcelona and wanted a good hotel away from the Ramblas. The Hotel America is an ideal location in that respect. It is not too far from the subway and is within walking distance (well for me, it's about 2km) of the Sagrada Familia . There are a number of Gaudi buildings and the top end of the Ramblas within 500-600m. The Parc Guell is about 3km. The room was a good size with furnishings that are quite chic. The hotel has a small roof top pool and a small gym and sauna. There is a good Tapas bar just around the corner that is a fraction of the price of those on the Ramblas. Review #14:My two young children and I stayed here for three nights pre-cruise and one night post-cruise in June/July. I chose this hotel based on reviews from this site and was not disappointed. We arrived early (around 10:30 a.m) and were able to get in our room right away. They still had to add the third bed we'd requested, but they did that while we were out taking a walk an hour later. Staff was wonderful...charming and helpful...especially Xabi and Fran at the front desk and Meritxell in the breakfast room. We added on the breakfast buffet for three of the four days and am so glad we did. We fueled up on delicious fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, bread and pastries that kept us going on long days of sight-seeing. (They also had hot items like eggs and sausage available, I just didn't try them.) Room was very clean with a great bathroom and shower. Not a huge variety of English channels on TV, but not a problem...I enjoyed practicing my Spanish and trying to figure out the Catalan on the local news stations. We took advantage of the rooftop deck and pool a couple of the nights...once so my kids could cool off after our long day of travel; the next to watch fireworks for the Festival of Sant Joan. Hotel is located in the Eixample neighborhood which was very nice and only three blocks away from Gaudi's La Pedrera and the Bus Turistic stop. Going back to the same hotel after our cruise for an extra night was great...felt like I was walking into \"Cheers\" where everyone knew who we were and welcomed us as old friends. I'd definitely stay there again! Review #15:Stayed here for our Yearly Girls trip away and were very comfortable at the hotel. Great location for exploring the city. We only stayed and did not eat there as there was too much exploring to be done. The rooms are spacious and clean. A very enjoyable stay. Review #16:stayed 4 night, recommend this hotel. likes: , convenient price, polite staff, near to Passeig de Gracia which is an elegant quarter, central ( 1 metro station to Placa de Catalunya ), good music dislikes: thin walls, small rooms, no daylight in the rooms, limited english tv channel Review #17:We stayed in the Hotel America in March 07 and had a nice time. We did find it a bit out of the way especially after a long day sightseeing. Very noisy at night and couldn't sleep with windows open. We were serenaded at 5.15am by buskers outside and this went on for an hour, and was repeated again the next morning!! Breakfast was lovely and staff helpful. Review #18:Last year i wanted to give my boyfriend a weekend barcelona. I booked by our travelagent in Holland. Because i had a question about our luggage ( we checked in very early) i sent them an email. There was absolutely no problem. I told them it was my boyfriends birthday present, and they promised me we would have a weekend to never forget. I also upgrade our room to a superior. When we came in, our room was allready been cleaned, so we could check in right away! They said \"happy birthday\" to my boyfriend and in the evening we were suprised by staff with a bottle champagne and a birthdaycard!!! We were there for 3 days, everything was clean, and nothing was to much for them! The top of the hotel was absolutely BEAUTIFULL!!!! It was a lounge area with a nice pool and very nice jacuzzi. The last day we had to be at the airport late in the evening, so they had a service for our luggage for the last day. Next time in Barcelona we will be in hotel America! Review #19:I stayed at the America for 5 days on a business trip. I booked a superior room with wifi included; unfortunately, the wifi wasn't working when I arrived. But they had it working the next day and for the rest of the stay, and offered to knock of the cost of breakfast for two days to make up for it. I thought the breakfast was very good, very typical for a Mediterranean/European hotel. (Note that breakfast isn't necessarily included in the price.) The room was nicely minimalist, the bathroom was very nice and included a bidet; overall the room was great. Other reviews have complained about noise, but didn't have any problems in that regard. The bed was the firmest bed I think I've ever slept on, but I liked it. A problem I had, which hopefully is not a chronic problem for the hotel, is that a small but noticeable amount of sewer gas was seeping in through the drains in the bathroom. The management was aware of it and was working on how to resolve it. Barcelona had been going through a pretty severe drought, and I suspect that inadequate water flow in the sewers may have accounted for it. As it was, I was able to solve it by simply opening the windows for a few minutes (I do like hotels that allow you to open the windows). Despite that problem, and the one day outage on the wifi, I'd gladly stay at the America again. It's not absolutely top drawer, but it's a good value. Review #20:Lovely always helpful & friendly staff. Clean room with good bed. Breakfast is very good and plentiful array of all sorts of food. Location is great with a Metro station just around the corner. The construction site though unsightly is not a concern at all so ignore the detractors who find fault with something outside the hotel's control. Would come back and stay here and will recommend this hotel to all my friends. Review #21:I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of April for 2 nights. My friend and I thought the hotel was very, very nice and contemporary and although there were roadworks going on outside the triple glazing took care of that. Upon arrival the hotel staff were absolutely lovely and told us the best places to visit and do shopping. The downside was when it came to the ironing. We needed an iron and were told that they did not provide them but could iron our clothes for us; there was no mention of cost at this time. The next morning we asked for 3 tops each and two pairs of jeans to be ironed, we handed the clothes over, still no mention of cost! We went out for the entire day and when we returned we saw our ironing waiting for us together with a bill for 57 euros. We were absolutely horrified by this and complained to the night shift manager. Two tops that did not cover your bottom were charged as dresses (8 euros each) and my cardigan was charged as a sweater and they also tried to charge for another non existent sweater. We complained about this, but both the night shift manager , Olaska and Javier on the next morning were extremely unhelpful and rude and did not want to assist us. Olaska even left a couple waiting to speak with her to leave the hotel without having their query dealt with; she could have asked us to step aside for one moment! It just goes to show how bad their customer services skills are, they were argumentative and unprofessional. They corrected the tops to dresses and the cardigan from a sweater to a top, but the fact they did not inform us of costs and failed to have the price list in our room upon arrival as they should have for our perusal, shows their inability to have even come to a compromise, which they flatly refused! A real shame considering the actual hotel and facilities (barring the ironing) were great. Review #22:At 106 UK Pounds per night and based on previous Tripadvisor reviews, we felt that we had chosen a quality accommodation option by booking America Hotel for our first visit to Barcelona. Sadly, the hotel came up very far short of our expectations. For a start, the location is not ideal, being situated on a side street in an area well north of the city centre. The hotel has one very small lounge room on the ground floor with a few chairs. This sole public room also contains a bar and the check in desk. On the first floor there is a small breakfast room but no restaurant. Did no previous reviewer think of pointing this out?? The bedrooms are very clean and minimally furnished. The beds are rock hard. The TV has 8 Spanish channels and about 8 other foreign channels, including CNN, which are blurred and grained with very poor reception. The bedroom windows leaked rain water unto the floor - we did get a room change but the second room had the same problem. The maid left a towel beneath the window for the duration of our stay. This is an Inn type property and not at all a full service hotel. We were left to ponder how, with such limited services, it ever managed to be classified as 4 star and how on earth it ever reached 16 th place on the Tripadvisor popularity ratings. We would not return, even at half the price. Review #23:I've stayde at this hotel for 6 days with one of my friends and we liked it. the hotel is a good choice for those who want to spend more times out for fun and shopping. it's near passieg de gracia and we zoomed for the street in order to shopping everyday. beware of construction over the hotel and it made us liitle sad. the metro station is near the hotel and we didn't have so many problems. th october 2011 had a good air and we could use the sea and discos. you know the hotel is far from the sea and u have to take a cab.the cleaning of the hotel was very good and spotless. Review #24:Just returned from a week in Barcelona staying at the hotel America.Loved the hotel especially the rooftop pool and terrace. Great place to chill after being out and about with the option to order food and drink to the terrace. The hotel was clean with modern decor. More of a boutique style hotel. The staff were nice, friendly and very helpful. The room was clean and comfortable with a free room safe which was a welcome find. The hotel had a small bar next to the reception which had a computer with free internet access. There was also a small gym(which provided water) and a sauna.Breakfast was great and although there was no restaurant this did not affect us as we were happy to eat out at the many restaurants within walking distance. Found some lovely seafood restaurants down at Port Olympic( a taxi ride away) which were extremely popular. Passage De Gracia was a 5 min walk away and it was about 15 min walk to the top of Ramblas.There was a subway one block from the hotel which was great if the feet needed a rest. An added bonus was the hotel's Smart car which you could have, for free, for 4 hours. We managed to borrow it hassle free and headed to a shopping outlet. The only cons were, the room had no drawers at all,there was no iron( ironing service available at a price), the air con occasionally became noisy which if you were a light sleeper was at times very annoying (you became too hot when it was switched off) and there was a bit of noise from the other guests returning at night. There were repairs to the roof terrace being carried out for 3 days, after we left, resulting in the pool area being closed. Thankfully this did not affect us as this was our haven for the duration of the holiday. The thing I noticed about Barcelona were the constant warnings about pick pockets, when you were sitting at restaurants and going into bars. Thankfully we had no encounters. All in all I would definitely return to hotel America and would recommend it. Review #25:This hotel is just great! It's a modern hotel with big modern rooms with flatscreen. The hotel is located in the best area of Barcelona: bario eixample, not far from the trendy passeig de gracia. It's also near very good restaurants and bars. When I go on holliday I always want to stay in a safe area and I can promise you that eixample is the safest area of Barcelona. The hotel has a beautiful loungie roof terrace with a swimmingpool and a jacuzzi and there is a bar where the friendly staff makes the best cocktails! The staff at the reception is also very friendly and want to help you with everything... I go a lot to Barcelona and I have been in a lot of hotels but from now on I will only book in Hotel America!! It's modern, friendly staff, swimmingpool, located in best area and the price is also democratic. And the roofterrace is just great! Review #26:I do not know how this hotel gets such good reviews. When I arrived at Hotel America, I was shocked at the scale of construction work taking place literally outside the front door - the taxi couldn't even get near the hotel because of it! I'm surprised the hotel is allowed to open its doors to customers. Apparently they are building a major new fast-train station right outside so you can imagine the amount of work involved. I could barely hear the receptionist on check-in due to the level of noise. And there was no way you'd be able to relax by the pool. The hotel itself feels more like a hostel. It is definitely not a 4 star. I'd say 2 star at best. You can hear everything going on in the corridor and rooms around you. My room seemed to join onto the council flats next door and I was hearing all sorts of strange noises throughout the night from someone who seemed to be having toilet troubles next door. As a single female, I didn't feel particularly safe in the hotel, mainly due to the fact that my room looked onto a very large run-down estate. The room itself was very basic, dark and not the cleanest room I've ever stayed in. The staff seemed amicable enough during my one night stay - I cancelled the rest of my stay and moved to the Princess Barcelona - a business hotel which was 100% better value for money at the beach-end of Diagonal. On a plus point, the hotel is very central, but at the expense of any kind of luxuries. So if it's just location you're looking for, this hotel might suit you. Review #27:Yes the construction was annoying but there is construction everywhere! The staff when out of their way to find us converters for our electric items which we forgot. We stayed for 4 days while waiting to board a Disney European Cruise. We had a fantastic time in the city in general although BEWARE of the gypsies. They will try to get money from you any way they can especially around La Sagrada Familia. We used the bus tour which was several hours long and extremely informative. Ok back to the hotel. The deck/outdoor terrace area we just didn't use as it was tiny. Unusable for a family of 6 pretty active/rambunctious people. Bar was beautiful and lobby is very small. Again, the staff is probably the best asset of this hotel. Review #28:I would reccomend this hotel to families that need to travel by train in Barcelona and people who want to enjoy a relaxing and luxury holiday. The hotel is just a few blocks away from Provinca station. Great for all the family, swimming pool and lounge on the roof with stunning veiws, also a gym and sauna downstairs. 5 star cleaning services, helpfull staff and scrummy food, Hotel America is a wonderful place to stay! Review #29:I stayed with my husband in the hotel america for a week and we loved it. We had a superior room with jacuzzi, spectacular bath window to the room. king size bed, DVD player, HIFI cordless, etc. There is a roof top area in the 7 th. floor whith pool and jacuzzi and with views over Barcelona (Sagrada Familia, Tibidabo mountain, Monjuic, etc.) Location was very very good. 5 mts to Paseo de Gracia and 15 mts to Plaza Cataluna. The staff was friendly and very polite. I would go back Review #30:This hotel was a really pleasant surprise. We really enjoyed our four night stay at Hotel America. It's a really good value, very modern hotel in a peaceful neighborhood. The neighborhood is walking distance to Las Ramblas but a lot more upmarket. There's plenty of cafe's and shopping nearby and it's very close to a metro stop. (Diagonal, I think) The Hotel is boutique size (7 floors) with modern furniture and wood flooring in the rooms. We shared a twin room and there was room for two suitcases, an armchair and coffee table and still plenty of space to walk around. The bathroom was large including a full-size tub. The breakfast buffet is good also - fruit, cereal, pastries, sausage,eggs etc The roof terrace is a bonus for a hotel at this price range - pool, sun lounges and day beds and they deliver room service to the terrace. We really enjoyed having somewhere to relax after walking around all day. I would definitely stay here again. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for people who won't/can't walk very far as it is 10 mins on the hoof to Las Ramblas, but if you're not fussed on the tourist tat down there then try this hotel. This is a real treat if you're on a budget. Review #31:We stayed here 2 years ago had a great time so decided to return . Great little hotel , staff very nice and friendly . Rooms nice a bit small but very clean nice bathroom . We loved the roof top terrace amazing views too . Weather was superb making our stay even better . This time we walked everywhere didn't bother with metro , it's around 20 minutes down to La Rambla. Tended to eat local in the evening some nice places around if you look . Small bar next door to hotel ( to the left ) is nice Semi and his wife are very welcoming. We will return had a better time this time round did all the sights last time so just chilled and shopped and enjoyed the fantastic weather .Thank you Hotel America.. Review #32:My wife and I stayed here 10-14th March for a citybreak booked through easyjet holidays. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Xabbi on the check in desk made us laugh every day.Breakfast was great,plenty of fruit and quality creals/yoghurts to choose from plus some hot foood. We were given a very detailed map on our check in,which we used instead of the map we'd bought with us as it was better! We walked everywhere because the weather was so good,most popular attractions are within 45 minutes walk. Free Wifi in the room was another bonus. Would certainly go back again and wouldn't hesitate in recommending. Review #33:The hotel was booked because of its proximity to my work location, but it is quite convenient to some lovely shopping. It provides room service for a light dinner and breakfast buffet. The rooms are clean and modern and the staff is helpful. Upon arrival the television did not work for a few days and initially the hairdryer in the room did not work (but the staff corrected the problem that day). Reasonable priced and functional. Review #34:Great ambience. Excellent staff who were all very helpful. Use of Smart car for 4 hours during the stay to tour the city, which was unique and unexpected! Breakfast was excllent, with great selection and something for everyone. Modern interior. My only comment would be that the air conditioning was turned off for Winter and the rooms were very hot - too noisy to sleep with the window open. Excellent location - 5 minute walk to La perdrera and the tourist bus stops. 2 minute walk to nearest Metro. Review #35:We were really delighted with the hotel - it is in a great location , close to the Rambla and Passeig de Gracia with lots of bars and restaurants close by. It was spotlessly clean , the staff very friendly, breakfast excellent. The roof terrace and pool were lovely. Our only concern was that our room was very warm but the airconditioning was switched off because it was on a winter setting so could only be heated. However it was good to be able to open the window and although there was traffic noise it didn't bother us ( we live in the country where there is no noise usually!) We were a bit apprehensive that other people had mentioned that the hotel was noisy and they could hear other guests but we did not find it to be a problem any more than any other hotel. We would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to our friends Review #36:Went to Barcelona for the weekend there and had a lovely time in Hotel Barcelona. Area is nice, safe with great shops ect, is about 15-20 min walk to La Ramblas and good location for metro stations. Service was excellent the bar staff lovely and reception staff also (Christian) happy to help with anything. We got a good deal on hotelsclick.com so our room was very good value for money, although it was two single beds pushed together. There is alot of construction work outside but didnt bother us and we got a good sleep every night. The terrace & pool on the roof was beautifull, a relaxing place to sit in the sun with nice cocktails. Definitely will return on our next visit to Barcelona! Review #37:my partner and i have visited barceloner many times usuly stay ramblers area this is far better location just 10 min away from catalunya square and nice walk to there are plenty of shops bars and resturants onway the hotel for us was perfect the staff are very helpful and freindly and the rooms exellent and the rooftop pool what can i say perfect definatly go back Review #38:Having stayed at this hotel in September 2008 wy wife and I have just returned from a 3nt break (15/7 to 18/7) and review as follows: As we arrived at the hotel on the Thursday afternoon and we noticed that the junction immediatley outside the front of the hotel had been closed off at the commencement of what looks like a long term underground project (more of this later ! ) . We later were informed that the air conditioning in the hotel was not working correctly. This was very noticable when you returned from the 30+ temperature outside to our room. There appeared to be no or very little air con inside the public areas which included the restaurant for breakfast. The breakfast was good with good service The rooms were kept clean however our room (401) had an issue with the wooden floor that was lifting which could have caused injury if someone had tripped over it. The area is still an excellent area to stay in for easy access to the main areas and has good local restaurants etc. The following morning at 9am the silence was broken by a concrete breaker attached to a JCB breaking through the raod surface which continued for most of the Friday however thankfully they did not work on the weekend. Thses works could be ongoing for some time so beware !!! if you like a sleep in. Sadly this time for our stay, I do not think the hotel achieved its 4 star rating and was more 3 star plus. Too many problems We would recommend it if the price was right and there were no major issues Review #39:In November me and my boyfriend went on our second trip to Barcelona. Although the hotel is not so close to the center, it's only a 15 minute walk to La Rambla. The staff was very friendly and helpfull and the breakfast was very tasty and there was a lot of choice! The room was comfortable and clean. The view could have been better but then again, we didn't go to Barcelona to sit in our room and look outside. The pool and bar area was closed seeing as it was November but the view from the roof was great. we found a nice restaurant at a corner nearby were we ate almost every evening. For the same price as a 3 star hotel on La Rambla we now got much more value for money. And the daily stroll down Rambla de Catalunya had it's charm. We would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who likes clean and simple rooms, nice food and is not afraid to take a walk everyday. But isn't that the idea of a citytrip? to see as much of the sity as possible. The first time we went to Barca we tried to do everything a tourist is supposed to do and see. we spent a lot of time underground. This time we saw the other side of Barcelona and this hotel is in the perfect location for this. We had a great stay here! Review #40:We have just returned from a short 5-day stay at the Hotel America, which lived up to its reputation for being modern with great service and facilities. It is in a \"quieter\" location though there is still some traffic noise which is slightly invasive. The rooms are clean and well maintained, and the service from the staff was excellent. Free internet access was appreciated and the reception staff even helped to book tables for us at our restaurants of choice! For a four star hotel near the centre of barcelona this is a great place to stay and is fabulous value. Try and book a higher level room to avoid the noise from the streets! Review #41:Stayed here for nearly a week for a medical convention. Especially Xabi, Slauka and Sara, but also the others whose names I don't know, gave me very friendly & good advice. Very nice extra: the hotel has a courtesy car you can use for 4 hours. Also a small but cosy terrace with swimmingpool. Furthermore modern furnished, clean but a bit noisy. Apparently the hotel is going to be renovated to adress that problem..... Review #42:This welcoming and comfortable hotel is perfectly situated for exploring Barcelona and is in one of the more upmarket and sought after addresses in the city. The staff were helpful and charming and made our five-day stay an absolute pleasure. Our third floor room was comfortable and quiet - our only complaint that the air conditioning was not turned on in the hotel because it was the beginning of April. However the staff kindly provided us with an electric fan which went some way to making the nights less stuffy. The buffet breakfast had a wide variety of food and was always a pleasurable way to start off our day. Sadly the unexpected rain during our stay didn't allow us to use the rooftop pool and terrace but had there been a little more sunshine, it would have been the perfect place to relax after a day exploring the city. I travelled with my husband and 14-year-old son and we were all extremely impressed with the hotel and would highly recommend it if you are considering a short break in Barcelona. Review #43:The hotel was clean and modern, breakfast was very good, fresh juices, hot and cold breakfast. We first got room 201, just make sure you don't get this room! It was incredibely noisy, because it is just in front of the two big roads and has large non-isolated windows. We asked for another room after a night of non-sleeping and we got room 209 which was very calm and not noisy at all. It's true that the rooms are a bit noisy, but hey, you're in a hotel in the middle of a big city... If you can, ask a a room at the back of the hotel, no noise from the outside and less neighbouring rooms... Rooms are not very big, but again... it's a hotel in a big city. Service was ok, we got free bottles of water the day we left. Review #44:Stayed for 4 nights at the Hotel America week commencing 7 March. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was clean and spotless, the rooms are constructed around a central atrium with the restaurant situated on the first floor, we were on the second floor so didn't have to bother with the lift. We also went up on the roof terrace from which you can make out the Sagrada Family along the road the hotel is adjacent to. Although sunny we didn't brave the pool. Never noticed the noise other posters have mentioned but we did stay midweek. They also provided breakfast buffet at 2 for 1 @ 14.25 Euros and there was plenty of fresh fruit, eggs bacon sausage, pastries, toast etc etc. Staff were very helpful and minibar selection was varied and not extortionate. Hotel is about a mile from Catalunya Square but it was a pleasant walk in every morning via Ramblas Da Catalunya which is a couple of blocks away. Beds were very comfortable but we walked so much everyday we were out like lights once we hit the pillow. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again when we return Review #45:Stayed here for 3 nights mid october. Had a room on the 1st floor which made it easy to get to and from. Check-in was quick and simple and the staff were very friendly. The room was very clean and nicely decorated, what you would expect from a decent hotel. The hotel was situated around a 10 minute walk from Diagonal metro station from where you can access the excellent metro network. The construction work looked a little daunting on arrival but as per other reviews was not really an inconvenience as the road was silent at night and no work took place at the weekend. It would only disturb you if you were going to be in the room for any length of time and even then was not that loud even from our room on the 1st floor. Overall a nice hotel at a reasonable price for a city centre hotel. Review #46:As others have pointed out, the Hotel America is situated in a charming neighbourhood, close to the uptown shopping districts and a wide selection of cafes etc. While the construction works taking place outside may not be very convenient (as taxis have to stop a short walk from the hotel), this did not really disturb me. In fact, the hotel as such is quite nice. I stayed in a superium room which was spacious, tastefully decorated and well equipped. (Sure, the view from the large windows would have been better without the construction site, but at least there were no works going on during the weekend when I stayed there.) Service was quite friendly. The only essential negative aspect I can think of is that it was kind of pricey - after a late booking, I ended up paying nearly \u20ac240 for one night (superior room, single use), which however included a very simple \"express breakfast\" (basically toast and coffee, i.e. not the buffet). Perhaps not great value at that price, but still, no complaints about the stay as such, and I would not hesitate to come back. Review #47:Stayed for four days, and had an excellent stay. Our room was not noisy or small (we had a third bed), it was clean, and the service was very friendly. Our only criticism was the cost of the breakfast (15 Euros, too much when we only wanted a continental breakfast) - we used the cafe Ramplax across the road, excellent value there. We would also recommend the Catalana restaurant (1 block South, two blocks East), really good tapas etc., good atmosphere, and not too expensive. It wasn't warm enough to use the pool, but it was nice to sit out on the roof with a drink. Review #48:we reserved 5 perfectly wonderful twin rooms for a hen weekend! The rooms were modern and clean with a mini bar(which they will empty for your own supplies), TV and hairdryer. I felt the hotel info book was a little on the lean side and the elecronic room safe kept locking itself with our money and passports inside! However, staff attended our needs very quickly and we only had to ask once for anything. On Sunday we used the roof pool area which was to die for! Especially after busy day sightseeing and a late night with the girls. Get there early to bag the few beds on offer. The giant sun-mattresses beat the sunbeds hands down on comfort and made us feel we'd really made it in the world! Dial 9 for bar/food service and sit back and enjoy. We bagged a minibus from the airport for 80eur which between 10 was a bargain. The hotel booked us 2 smaller minibuses for 130eur (for 2) for our return. Not that many bars in the hotel vicinity but there is a great one opposite the hotel with a fabulous relaxing area upstairs with a giant leather bed and trendy cubes. Beer 2eur each but the vodka was a bit pricy. Hard Rock cafe highly recommended but we had to wait ages for a table as they don't take bookings for <15. It simply meant we had plenty of time to spend and sample the cocktails in the lower bar, so no complaints there! The food portions were ace and very good value. Catch a taxi to Port Olimpique for 9-10eur and you can find some good restaurants and enjoy a proper pub crawl! The pubs were a bit too spread out for our liking along the Ramblas so go straight for the port if you want the buzz of a good night out. We took the sightseeing bus at 11am on Saturday but get there earlier if you want a top deck place. Review #49:We recently stayed one night at the Hotel America Barcelona Hotel after returning to Barcelona from a short med cruise. We booked via the internet after reading good reviews. On arrival we found the guy on the receptionist realy friendly and helpful he could speak reasonable english and made as feel welcome straight away. When he looked up our reservation he said that he was going to upgrade us at no extra charge, we of course was thrilled and found our room was lovely. It had a jacuzzi bath with bath salts and candles, dressing gowns and slippers and complimentry coffee and tea plus a mini bar that you could use and pay for when checking out, the bedroom was large and bright very nicely furnished and absolutely spotless. There was construction site directly outside but although it was Thursday we never heard any noise from the site. We also was thrilled to go on the roof where there was a swimming pool and lovely tables and sofas. It was so nice we had lunch there before setting out to explore Barcelona. The breakfast included was an express breafast which we were happy with but for an extra charge you could upgrade and have a full breakfast. On check out there was a lovely woman who phoned for a taxi when we needed and they also let us leave our cases in the morning as we were not due to get our coach to the airport until 1pm. We will definetly stay at this hotel again as it made our short stay excellent plus there are excellent restaurants around the corner much better than the ones near La ramblas which seemed overpriced and geared up for tourists. Review #50:Very good location and friendly staff. But the waitress at the breakfast is chasing you out if you come at the end of the service. The pool is not heated and very small and there are only a few chairs on the terrace... the bar on the terrace is not open all the time... Doors banging all the time (including during the night when guests come back from going to discotheques)... Poor noise isolation... Review #51:a great location - a five/ ten minute walk away from the busy ramblas area-perhaps more suited to people who have been to barcalona before and are more confident about exploring on their own. Rooms and facilities are more business - like than plush- but everything you need provided . Staff very friendly and attentive-i sprained my foot on the third day and could not walk -without me even asking they went away and found and gave me some crutches!! No restaurant but this gives you every reason to explore excellent restaurants literally on your doorstep for evening meals - \"pulpo\" and \"provenza\" are opposite and provide great food at great prices. Breakfasts can also be found cheaply minutes away eating with spanish locals One of the main reasons I booked was the roof garden whick has a very small pool and sunbathing areas - this came in very handy when I could not move for a day - I sat on the extensive decking under sun umbrellas and had food and drinks delivered throughout the day by willing and friendly staff - I will definately being going back to this hotel again Review #52:We stayed at Hotel Amercia for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The best bit is the roof terrace, with pool to cool down in after a long day sight seeing. There was usually a member of staff up there to provide towels, food and drink. It was lovely to drink champagne on the terrace early evening as the lights are turned down and the candles are lit. The breakfast was superb, lots of choice to suit all tastes - egg, bacon and sausages, bread, cold meats and cheese, cereal, yoghurts fresh and dried fruit, nuts, croissants and patisseries, fruit juices.... The room we had was a corner room with double bed and air conditioning. The room was very clean and the maid/housekeeper left my nightie arranged prettily on the bed like origami every day. The location of the hotel was great, just 2 blocks away from the nearest metro, 30 minute walk to Gaudi's unfinished cathedral, and 3 blocks from the tourist bus stops. There are many bars and restaurants within minutes of the hotel, in a very nice area of barcelona, with superior shops. Be careful of pickpockets in the more touristy areas including the metro (we nearly came a cropper on the metro but managed to foil them at the last minute) - however, did not feel this kind of threat in Eixample around the hotel. All in all, a lovely stay, ideal if you want a romantic break. Would definitely return in the future. Review #53:I have just returned from my fourth visit to Hotel America in Barcelona, I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing short break. I stayed in the superior room on the third floor, the package included a bottle of cava and flowers in the room. I stayed on a B&B basis, the breakfast was very good although I did not have the cooked choice everything else was lovely. I did read about roadworks on tripadvisor but all was finished in Jan'12 The staff on reception were very helpful and especially Xabi. The hotel has a small bar near the reception desk where you can get a coffee or drink at most times of the day and into the evenings. My only downside of the hotel albiet a minor one was that the only british TV chanel was BBC world news, this just repeats the same thing over and over again. Another plus while I was there was the sun shone the whole time and although it was winter it was pleasant all the same. I will be back to the Hotel America very soon. Review #54:After missing our flight (my fault) we arrived a day late in Barcelona. We had pre booked a taxi to our hotel but because of our later arrival we had to get a taxi at the airport. All of which are metered & worked out at 30 euros into central Barcelona (10 euro cheaper than our pre-booked taxi!) The hotel America was ideally situated for all the major attractions & tourist bus routes. There is currently on going road/underground rail work going on outside the hotel which on the plus side makes the road quiet during the evening as traffic is unable to use this route past the hotel. Engineering work starts at about 8am but really should'nt bother you at all because you will be keen to get out & about this wonderful city. The reception staff at the hotel are very helpful & will guide you through the map so that you can make the most of your stay & see all the sites. The bedrooms are of a good size & comfortable with a mini-bar & safe in them. Tv channels not so good but hey! what are you doing still in your room! The Breakfast room is nice with glass walls & good air conditioning. The staff again are attentive & helpful. Breakfast is ok & adequate but nothing spectacular. On the roof of the hotel is a small unheated swimming pool & terrace which was great mid-afternoon for a quick dip in the hot afternoon sun to recharge for more sight seeing. There is a nice lounge area on the roof with a bar where you can enjoy a lazy drink whilst looking out across the rooftops of the city. To sum up...ideally situated, great for a short break & would recommend you stay. Ps if you love football you must do the Barca Tour of the stadium (22 euros) Review #55:I stayed at Hotel America Barcelona in Sept 2011.The location of this hotel is good, its close to a metro station & its possible to walk to Plaza Cataylona from the hotel. The breakfast is ok (nothing special) and the rooftop amenities are good. There are also several nice restaurants near the hotel & the neighbourhood is generally good & has a nice vibe. Those are the positive things about the hotel. I had several issues with the hotel in general though. Its calling itself a 4* hotel & yet 2 of the rooms on each floor have no windows or natural light at all. Do not stay in rooms 9 or 10 on any of the floors, they have no windows at all, I stayed in room 10 on my first night & it was like being in a cell of some sort - horrible. Fortunately I managed a room change the next day.There is a terrible smell in the bathrooms of those rooms in particular & in the bathrooms in general. I do not know if its the chemicals they are using to clean the bathrooms with or the fact you can't ventilate any of them but I have never encountered such a smell anywhere & it was extremely unpleasant to say the least. I switched the air-con off altogether & that seemed to improve the smell in the bedroom area of the room so while the room wasn't cool I could at least breathe in it. There is a major construction project going on just outside the hotel, the upside of that is that there is no through traffic. The down side is that work starts at 8 am & apart from seista time doesn't finish until 8pm. You can hear the noise everywhere including on the roof. Would I stay at this hotel again? No. Would I stay in that neighbourhood in a different hotel - definitely. Solo traveller Sept11 Review #56:We have just returned from my daughters hen party weekend. This hotel was recommended by the travel agent, so the staff knew well in advance thet seventeen females would be staying for two nights. On arrival, we were greated by two lovely members of staff who made us all feel very welcome. They showed us a map of the area and places of interest as we all wanted to see and experience the beautiful culture of Barcelona. Our rooms were clean, modern and comfortable and the amenities fine for a short break holiday. We all decided to relax and chat by the rooftop pool and this is where we were all made to feel like we just were not welcome. Some staff spoke to us very rudely without any obvious reason. On several occasions I was told to be quiet which I found extremely unreasonable as I am 50 years old and have never in my life been made to feel so unwelcome and very embarrassed. Other visitors did comment to us on how rude they thought the staff were towards us and with no obvious reasons as to why. So, if you are thinking of making a group booking, I would advise you to seek elsewhere and this is a real shame because the hotel itself is ideal for those lovely short city breaks. Review #57:This was my first trip to Barcelona, and I had no idea what to expect. I was extremely pleased. The hotel was clean, which is an absolute must for me. The staff was very helpful. (Perhaps it helps that I can speak Spanish). My husband and I were not disappointed. We were pleased by the location because it was so near to Las Ramblas, but far enough that we did not have to deal with city noise. Review #58:Very helpful desk staff provided maps and excellent advice......Lovely terrace/rooftop bar. Good location 3 blocks to metro and tourist buses. Fabulous local restaurants just down the street (South)........Cabanela straight out the door down the street on the right ! Bit noisy on Saturday night but hey Barca were playing ! Fabulous City hopefully will return ! Review #59:This hotel was the last stop on our 18 day trip across Europe. We stayed at 3-5 star hotels in 6 different cities and this hotel compared with our cheapest 3 star hotel. The hotel was the second most expensive only beat by the 5 star hotel and by the time we add in parking and internet I'm not sure it wasn't as much. The room was very noisy, I could hear the people in other rooms, lots of noise from outside and the room wasn't very clean. My friends took a tissue and rubbed it on the bathroom floor and it was filthy. Maintenance on the hotel is lacking in all areas. The walls in one room were all scrapped up with exposed sheet rock. The air conditioner sounds like a lawn mower everytime it starts up. The door man was very friendly but the front desk staff was not. The beds were not good quality and the internet was painfully slow. If you are going to charge for something it should at least work well. I would not recommend this hotel. Review #60:In my opinion this is quite an overrated hotel. I stayed here between Christmas and New Year's Eve 2005, had booked a single room (100 Euros) and was treated to a windowless, tiny room. Decor is modern indeed, but not of the best taste. A gym is available, but it merely consists of a small weights machine, a bicycle and a \"running\" machine. Service is pretty indifferent. The hotel lobby is extremely small and really unsuitable to wind down after a day spent strolling through the magnificent city that is Barcelona. In all, this was probably a 2 or 3 star that was refurbished in a \"modern\" fashion to look more costly, but deep down can't really hide its roots. I had booked 3 nights, only stayed the 1st and went to the NH Calder\u00f3n for the other 2. My God, what a difference ! For about the same price it was a huge difference in comfort and quality. Review #61:My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon in September 2011. We should have listened to the reviews we saw on trip advisor. The hotel is like staying at a construction site. The city is doing major construction right outside the hotel and ALL day everyday, all your hear is construction. The crane outside the hotel seemed to never stopped working. If you want to take a siesta at 5 or 6pm, don't even attempt it. The construction work went until it got dark outside, which was until 8pm! The hotel rooms are very nice and clean, and the hotel has a nice roof top bar. BUT, it's impossible to enjoy any of this when all you hear is construction noise. Review #62:I stayed in the America hotel 12-15th August with another couple and we loved it! We arrived at 11am to helpful and friendly reception staff and checked into our rooms with no problems. We loved the clean spacious rooms, comfortable bed, decor, lighting, free use of safe in the room and air con and the rooftop terrace with pool and jacuzzi. Whenever we wanted to relax by the pool there was always somewhere to lay down and sunbathe. The rooftop has lovely views of the mountains although the drilling in a nearby hotel did give me a bit of a headache but this isnt the hotels fault!! I just asked them to play some music and they did so without hesitating and it was good music at that!! We found the hotel's drinks and food were expensive so we had a drink in the bar next door at a fraction of the price, The hotel were so helpful and recommended a good restaurant down the road which did the most amazing tapas as we had a bad experience eating out on our first night. We checked out of our rooms at 12pm and our flight was at 10pm but we had use of the shower room in the gym and found this very useful. The hotel is in a good location being a 15-20 walk from the Ramblas and 30-40 mins from the Port and Sea. However this suited us as we like peace and quiet and found the buses and metro very useful and it saved our legs when we were tired and hot. Overall a very pleasant stay that made our trip to barcelona a memorable experience. Would definately recommend it to family and friends. Review #63:We visited this hotel for a weekend in March. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. We had no problems with noise and the beds were comfy. The location was decent as it's only a step away from the metro which gets you everywhere quickly! We didn't have any food in the hotel, we thought it was overpriced. Coffee was good though and the rooftop is fab even in March. La Pedrera is a few minutes walk away as is all the higher end shopping eg Gucci. We were very pleased with our choice of hotel all things considered and \u00a370 per room seemed a bargain. NB Take you own hairdryer, the bathroom ones are next to useless - reception will lend you a travel plug if you are silly enough to bring an American one as I did! Barcelona was a great city with loads to do and very friendly people! Review #64:I stayed in Barcelona during the Mobile world congress(MWC) in Feb 2012. At this time, all hotel rates are sky high. I booked 2 months in advance and was able to get a rate of approx Euro 230 including tax, wifi and express B/fast (basically toast/muffins/juice/tea coffee). And the cancellation policy was also good. At the time of the MWC, the hotels typically want the money upfront and do not refund. But this was good. You can pass by the hotel and miss it. They should have a bigger and brighter sign. Lobby was decent, with a sprinkling of sofas. They have a bar at one end. Check in was smooth and the people sounded friendly. The room was very good. Modern decor, comfortable bed, a nice relaxing chair, desk etc. It also had a Flat panel TV and an ipod dock. They also have a music system and DVD player, and you cna borrow dvds from the reception. The bathroom was very good. Very bright, clean. Had all the required toiletries. Had a bath tub with a JACUZZI. Yes that's right. Put in the bath salts kept there, light the candles and enjoy a nice spa, right in your room. Water was hot and pressure was good. The only thing missing was an ironing board, and they do not provide one even on request. Real let down. Housekeeping was done on time and room was made up very well. Room faces the street and had lots of sun coming in. So if you want to soak in the sun, ask for a room facing the street. Overall, an excellent stay and value for money, considering the rates at other barcelona hotels during MWC time. Review #65:stayed at the hotel in august, we were 3 adults sharing a room and although it was cramped, the 'camp bed' was comfortable and the room was clean and all we could wish for. it was handy to have a fridge in the room and we bought water from teh little supermarket round the corner of hte hotel and kept it nicely chilled. Although the hotel is only a couple of blocks from the metro station and the trains are very frequent, i felt it was a little bit out of the way and i would rather stay somewhere more central next time i go to bareclona. there was free wifi in the hotel which was handy, and the sunloungers on the roof were great for catching a few rays - although there werent many and it is a small area. The service was great and breakfast was ample, with the usual cereals, breads and cheeses etc. although there was construction work right outside it wasnt too much of an inconvenience although we did get work up one day at about 9am... so not too bad! Review #66:I stayed in Hotel America for a week with my Partner and we absolutely loved it - probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in! The rooms were comfortable and very clean and the hotel was modern and clean throughout. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much bother at all. The roof top terrace was excellent a great place to relax after a days sightseeing! The breakfasts were excellent as well there was so much to choose from and everything was fresh and plentiful. The hotel also sell some gifts in the reception area which we found were a very reasonable price compared to the gift shops we went to. There are lots of nice places nearby to eat but I would definitely recommend a place called The Attic on Las Ramblas and also the Fairy Forest themed pub next to the wax museum. We booked our stay through Octopus Travel and got a very good rate which included breakfast. Already saving up for our trip back to Hotel America! Review #67:Booked the Hotel America for a congress in Barcelona, together with three colleagues. We stayed three nights. The hotel is centrally located and is a good 4star. We were very pleased with the hotel staff, they were very nice, friendly and helpful. The hotel offers some nice extra's (they have a car that can be used for a couple of hours free of charge, wireless internet was free, etc.) We particularly enjoyed the roof terrace and bar, with a nice view over Barcelona. Definitely a place to keep in mind, next time, I'll be in Barcelona ! Review #68:Fantastic hotel, my personal favourite in Barcelona (out of the 4 or 5 I've stayed in. A word of warning, do not use the taxis at the airport, they will cheat you and will try to charge up 80 euros if they think they can get away with it. Get the airport shuttle to Plac de Catalunya and a taxi from there to your hotel - costs about 6 euros....you do the maths! :-) Review #69:Wonderful hotel with extremely clean and well-appointed rooms (bath salts for the jacuzzi tub, candles & matches, robes, slippers, nice toiletries). Front desk staff were all friendly and helpful. Breakfast is nice, but also easy to walk next door for coffee and pastry. Only problem was that the entire square in front of the hotel is in the midst of a huge excavation project for the underground, and workmen and equipment started at 8am. Not sure how long it's scheduled to continue - if you wake up early or aren't a light sleeper, probably not an issue other than the view. Plus side is no traffic noise! Within several blocks of a couple metro stops, with lots of good restaurant choices within easy walking distance. Review #70:Stayed at the Hotel America for a 3 night break with British Airways. Nothing bad to report on this hotel at all; in fact if returning to Barcelona, would be quite happy to stay here again, because of its location. The rooms are perhaps slightly smaller than one would expect and no balcony, but perfectly adequate. Room came with large LCD TV. Room was clean and kept clean, towels were good, and the shower was powerful and hot. Would benefit from having tea and coffee facilities in room. Hotel has a roof garden and small swimming pool, which would be great later in the year, but not in March (Although weather on our last day was fabulous) Breakfasts were varied and filling with a good selection, although if you want a decent cuppa take your own tea bags because the hotel ones were awful! Reception was efficient and helpful, and advised us on how to see the best of the city in the short time we were there. The street outside could be a bit noisy (certainly on our first evening) but it didn\u2019t really bother us. The hotel was small, and very quiet. Absolutely no worries about recommending this hotel Review #71:We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The location was great and the area was quite. We had close to everything and we had the Metro and the railway just around the corner. When we arrived we had a citymap on the table and a bottle of cava! Breakfast was good and the stuff was very helpful. You must order a Mojito at the poolbar, they were awesome and worth every penny! Review #72:I stayed here with my partner, we had a short 2 night break and the room was lovely. didnt try the breakfast and they didnt offer any other meals. the Italina Man on reception was superb and recommended places to eat and visit. i would return! Review #73:Just returned from a 4nt stay at the Hotel America and having previously stayed off the Ramblas area I must say this was a far better experience of Barcelona. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were cleaned everyday to the same excellent standard. Initially we were on the 6th Floor just below the rooftop terrace and the room was excellent for getting to the pool and back however after a couple of days of experiencing drainage smells from the room which the hotel staff did try to rectify with chemical cleaners we were given the option of moving to the 3rd floor which we accepted. The only thing wrong with this from my own personal view was there was a lot more road noise and noise from building works that are going off just over the road from the hotel which appear to commence every morning at 7.30am. I found the breakfasts to be good and experienced none of the problems other reviewers have had, the food was plentiful and the service good. The pool area was clean everyday and there is bar service and food available at poolside if required. The reception was very helpful and always friendly and I would have no hesitation in staying here again.It was a very relaxing stay in a less touristly part of the city where you can easily get to the busier parts if required . Review #74:Me and my wife stayed in the 'America Hotel' for six nights at the end of march.The taxi ride from the airport only cost 15 euro { We fonud the taxi's in barcelona to be very cheap and reliable, from the hotel to las rambels is about 4 euro between two people if you flag it on the street. }First impressions of the room were excellent.It was modern bright & clean with a mini fridge which we filled with our own water e.t.c. Can't fault the hotel on anything except the noise.As you have read in other reveiws the floors are wooden & the walls must not be insulated so at one stage i could actually hear someone somewhere having a shower ! The breakfast was great {my wife tryed everything! }The rooms had air-con & a large clean , stylish bathroom.Overall a very pleasent stay helped by friendly and courtious staff. Review #75:Stayed here for a week and it is in the best location. Only a short walk to the metro, train station and some of the best attractions. The hotel was clean and staff pleasant but found their knowledge wasn't all up to scratch. We were travelling by train to Figueres the next day and thought we knew what we were doing but wanted to check with the reception. The guy on reception nearly sent us in to town to catch the train and told us it was twice as much as we had researched before coming to Barcelona. We postponed the trip so we could go check it out first as it meant a very early morning wasted otherwise. As it turned out we were correct all along and we shouldn't of asked as it just confused us. The hotel was extremely noisy at night and our bed was really uncomfortable and everytime we moved it made a noise so we hardly slept. We never had breakfast at the hotel as they were charging 16 Euro's but only 2 doors away is a pastry shop which has the nicest croissants and on the corner is a coffee shop where a cup of coffee with milk (cafe con Leche) is only 1.35 Euro. There are loads of great Restaurants around which serve a selection of food but check the prices at the door of each first as they vary dramatically. Review #76:In our opinion the location of the Hotel was idea as it is situated in a nice quiet area that provided many eating and drinking options close by and was within easy walking distance to the tourist oriented areas like Las Ramblas and the upmarket shopping streets of Gracia and Catalunya. The Hotel is a smart, chic establishment with clean modern design lines. The rooms are comfortable, clean and provide all the facilities that you need. The restaurant serves breakfast only, but they do it very well with a great variety of food from cereal to smoked salmon. The pool and spa on the roof looked good but the weather was a bit cool to go in. In the bar a free internet terminal is provided for guest use. One of the best things that we liked was that we arrived at Hotel at 5.30am after an early flight from Cairo and we were able to get an early early check in to our room without any hassle. We have no hesitation in recommending Hotel America. Review #77:I have stayed a few times and the staff are great rooms are clean and reasonably quiet, good affordable eateries nearby and not a bad location Aim for middle to higher floors away from street unless the new metro works have been finished, they used to do a 3 hour courtesy car offer too. There are car parks nearby but parking itself does require some effort and really is the only downside Review #78:Chose this hotel for its central location in the Eixample district and so glad we did. A short distance from the underground made it easy to reach using the rail line direct from the airport. We could've used the underground to get around but we chose to walk everywhere stopping at various cafes or bars along the way. This hotel really is the perfect base from which to explore the city. As for the hotel itself, staff friendly and welcoming, lovely bar area near reception, gorgeous roof terrace and rooftop pool. We started many evenings with a drink on the roof terrace, the time of year however, meant the pool was a tad chilly but could be lovely during summer. The room was nicely decorated, modern and clean with a lovely bathroom, perfect. The one downside, our room was at the front of the hotel on a relatively busy road with numerous cars/trucks/noisy deliveries made in the early hours which often woke us up. Didn't help that Barcelona FC won a match while we were there as the fans took to driving the streets and honking their car horns repeatedly through the night. Otherwise an enjoyable stay. Review #79:Date: March 28th 2006 Reviewer: A Trip Advisor Member, Scotland We have just returned from a 4 night break at the Hotel America Barcelona. The hotel was excellent and the staff very helpful and friendly. Good breakfast very clean rooms, good location central to metro station all in all our stay was 10/10. Was not brave enough to drive the free 4 hour Smart Car which is on offer. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #80:Staying for three nights, we obtained an excellent \u00b4Romantic Package\u00b4 deal booking directly with the hotel itself. This included a superior room with hydromassage bath, a bottle of cava, flowers, and breakfast. Our room had a great view of the street outside and, though not huge, was of a good size. The bed was spacious and comfortable, there was a modern flat-screen television, coffee machine, and bathrobes and slippers. The marble bathroom was attractive with a good size bath, and the candles and bath salts were a nice extra touch. The location of the hotel is superb, in a trendy and upmarket area just off the Paseig de Gracia. The hotel staff were very friendly. Although we did not go in the hotel bar on the ground floor, it looked warm and welcoming. As it was fairly cold, we did not use the (small and shallow) swimming pool at the top of the hotel but we did do up to have a look and there was a spacious terrace with comfortable sofas and chairs, as well as a jacuzzi tub. There was also a small gym and sauna in the basement. Further there was a little \u00b4courtesy car\u00b4 parked out front, available to use for up to four hours. Just a few down sides. Though the rooms are nice, the reception and corridors are a bit basic and lacking for a four star hotel. The buffet breakfast leaves rather a lot to be desired. The room was clean, however the housekeeping staff did not clean or replace our used coffee cups throughout the duration of our stay. However, the most annoying thing is that the walls are extremely thin so you can easily be disturbed by noise from other guests. All in all, if you can obtain a good deal for this hotel, it is well worth staying here for a city break as the location is fantastic and the hotel is friendly and comfortable overall. Review #81:I stayed in Hotel America from May 30th to June 2nd, 2006 and I have to say I was somewhat disspointed. I made my reservation here based on the reviews on this website. I have to say that in the past the reviews were dead on, bu this time, I think that the reviews on this hotel are somewhat overrated. We arrived to find the room with an extremely musty smell. We had to open the windows in order to air out the room. The sheets and the towels had a strange smell. The Breakfast, good, but EXPENSIVE - try El Apeadero which is a block away on Proivenca. The gym that they advertise on their website, awfyul. The treadmill did not work, and the one weight machine was complicated to figure out. I do not think I will stay here again, considering there are much better 4 star hotels all over the Eixample. Review #82:Stayed here... rooms a bit different from the regular med. Very stylish and clean. Pool a little small (it is a rooftop one after all) and cold! Service - excellent. Location - good, slightly outside of the touristy areas but walkable to las ramblas. Would definately recommend this hotel. Review #83:We stayed for 3 nights in the Hotel America in late December. The rooms are very modern and very nice. I really liked the location and the hotel. It is located about 3 blocks from the main area of interest. It is an excellent location to base a stay to explore the most interesting parts of the city. We were able to walk all over the Las Ramblas neighborhoods and the Gothic district. We even walked to the Sacred Familia Cathedral in no more than 15 minutes one morning. The breakfast is more than adequate although they do run out of things if you wait too long to go to breakfast. The negatives for us were that the street noise is pretty loud in the room. We were on the 5th floor and it was difficult to sleep. This is complicated by the fact that the air conditioning is not on while they are in heating mode and they keep the hotel halls very warm at least on our floor. This meant in order to sleep we had to open the windows to cool the room, which meant that the noise became much worse. Our methodology evolved to where we opened the windows in the evening to get the room cold and then closed them to go to bed. The other problem was that the beds didn't have a top sheet but a very nice down comforter. This means that you are either under the comforter or exposed, this is hard for me to regulate my sleeping comfort temperature. This set up though is very typical in Spain, and it is hard to fault the Hotel America for this. Just be aware. Review #84:Just back from staying at the hotel America in Barcelona and we loved it. The rooms were lovely and clean and if you are lucky enough to get a corner room as we were you get some great views. The rooftop pool was a real plus too. Great place to stay but would avoid the weekend if we came back as large groups of people overcrowded the pool area. Review #85:The hotel is good. I'm staying there right now. Breakfast is more than ok. Interior is nice. But I expect that for the price I pay. It is a bit expensive for such a hotel. 172 euro per night for a superior room of 1 person... There is wireless internet coverage in the hotel. You have to pay for that, but don't do that. Just go near the window in your room and try to get on one of the non-secured networks. There are several! ;-) Review #86:I stayed at this hotel for a weekend with two of my friends. I liked the location as it is in close proximity to the Ramblas and two blocks away from Casa Mila. It is also around the corner of the Palacio Flamenco where we booked dinner and the show. The rooms were spotless with a full bar, three robes and enough towels. Beds were comfortable and sheets clean and fine and when window's closed, no noise coming from outside. Internet access and bar available anytime and breakfast was great! Staff weren't overly friendly but they were helpful when needed. I didn't find Catalonians being too friendly in general. They are quite reserved. The terrace has a pool and lounge chairs/sofas that is great for relaxing! Overall rating for this hotel with great value, I give it between 4 and 5 stars! I would stay there again and recommend it to others. Review #87:Stayed here in May 2010 with a couple of friends for our first trip to Barcelona. The location ideal for walking to the Cathedral and Sagrada Familia,shops, and the tour bus. The hotel staff were wonderful especially as we needed help getting a cab to Montserrat outside the city and our Spanish is meager at best. They were patient with us, it seemed we needed much help for other things as well, so appreciated that. The roof top pool and lounge area with bar was our favorite place to meet for a drink and the views of the city at the end of the day. Stunning area in all respects. The rooms were spacious and clean, but if you leave a window open at night be prepared for noise as it is a bustling area all hours with people coming home from clubs from 3 AM to 6 AM....this is Spain and the Spanish love to party. Review #88:i'll start with the good points - hotel is in a great location, easy to walk to all the main attractions and a very short walk to a metro and train station. And there are many top-rated restaurants and bars close by. There is work going on outside the hotel, but despite staying in a room facing the construction site we weren't bothered by the noise. And that's all i can say that is positive. I think the friendly, helpful staff must all have been on holiday in the week that we were there - staff were either abrupt or ignored us completely. Our room was tiny and an odd shape, probably ok for one person but far too small for two, storage for clothes/luggage was terrible, the complimentary bathrobes and slippers were nowhere to be seen, the bathroom was damp and covered in mould, paint was peeling from the ceiling, the windows leaked when it rained, the air conditioning didn't work - and apparently this was the receptionist's favourite room in the hotel! The 'gym' consisted of three machines (a stepper, a running machine and a bike) that looked like they were made in the 80s, and any time we tried to access the pool area on the roof the door was locked!! Overall i'd say it was ok if you are staying for one or two nights max and not planning to be in the hotel much. Otherwise i'd look elsewhere. Review #89:Have just spent 4 nights at this splendid hotel with 5 other female friends. 1st April to 5th April. The Hotel America is very friendly, very clean and the breakfasts are superb. It is a pleasant 10/15 minute walk from the hotel to Las Ramblas. It is situated in a very nice and quiet area where there are lots of nice shops. The restaurants round about are many and varied so you will never be stuck for somewhere to eat. The rooftop swimming pool and sun terrace are lovely but unfortunately we didn't get a chance to use them because it rained for our entire stay!! Instead we got to use the bar area!!. However this gives us a good excuse to return and it will certainly be to the Hotel America! Review #90:Clean and modern in a great area of town. I don't know if I would call area residential as others have - there is a lot going on. It is about 10 blocks removed from the mayhem but easy enough to get there if you want by metro or taxi (cheap taxis!). The only complaint was that it was a bit loud, but it didn't keep us up. We got the Barcelona card as our travel books recommended but didn't find the value in it. I would recommend just taking the metro and taxis. Review #91:Stayed at hotel america for five nights with my husband after it was recommended by a friend. After looking at the reviews decided to stay as the majority are very good. This hotel is very clean staff are helpful if asked for assistance. The terrace is lovely specially when you return in the evening and want to enjoy some evening sun. However, drinks are expensive as a bottle of local beer in the terrace bar costs four euro but can be bought in the supermarket around the corner for fifty cent! Rooms are a decent size but walls are paper thin. Hard to sleep if your neighbours are having a few drinks in their room or watching tv any way loudly at all. When quiet I even heard the people next dooe use and flush the toilet! Location is fairly good but iftou want to be close to the action on las ramblas it is a good trek so if you don't like walking 20-25 minutes in the heat then this hotel is not for you! Would definatley stay in Barcelona again but would pick a hotel more central! Review #92:I am a travel agent. The Hotel America, is a boutique hotel that has a perfect location. I picked a hotel based on your website and the reviews. I had the oportunity to stay there after a cruise, and must say, we were very pleased with everything abaut this hotel. I just wish we could have stayed longer. Review #93:I have no idea why this hotel is so low on the Trip Advisor ratings. This is an amazing place to stay at. Walking distance to Passeig de Gracia and La Ramblas. Was in Barcelona for a day with two rambuctious pre teens, prior to taking a Med Cruise. Chose this hotel after reading TP reviews and was so glad I did. Elegant boutique hotel, incredibly clean and spacious rooms, and an outstanding rooftop pool with a bar area you can relax in. Both boys have travelled extensively and unanimously voted this the best hotel they have been in. Staff were friendliness itself and couldn't have been more helpful. They even provide courtesy big fluffy towels for the pool. Everyone speaks English, so the boys felt quite comfortable making their requests known. Location couldn't have been more ideal. We walked to the Casa Batllo and the Ramblas very easily. And there were loads of quality eateries all around us. Felt very safe in the area, as a single woman with two children in tow. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and would definitely urge a stay here if you like quality accomodation without the price tag. Review #94:My family and I stayed here for 4 nights. We had rooms (double and twin). Rooms were fine: clean, well serviced, nice bathroom. Not massive but certainly not small. Location was good - about 20 mins walk to Placa De Catalunya but there is a metro station approx 100m from the hotel. The breakfast was a good selection of cereals, ham, cheese, eggs, fruit, yohgurt etc. There was even some scrambled egges, bacon and mini sausage. On the roof there is a small swimming pool and terrace which is great after a day sightseeing. The staff were really helpful and knowledgeable. Nothing was too much trouble. Check out is 12pm but as our flight wasn't until 10pm they told us that we could leave the bags, use the pool and have a shower in the gym. Overall a nice hotel for a short trip and I would be quite happy to stay there again. Review #95:We just stayed 4 nights in Hotel America at Barcelona and we truly enjoyed this fabulous hotel. Clean room, Xlarge bed, good working airconditioning, fancy breakfast buffet with fresh products and friendly personal. We certainly recommand the pool/lounge area at the roof of the hotel where you can enjoy a tasty coctail, cool cava, wine or beer. You don't need to bring your own towel or towel from the room as they give you a large one there. This is very handy. Nice to chill in the pool after having walked in the city centre for hours. We will certainly take this hotel again if we visit Barcelona again. This hotel gets a 10 plus from us. Review #96:Can't recommend this place enough. Great location, friendly service, with nice, clean, modern rooms. The pool area is great for relaxing after you've done the sights or for a pre dinner drink before you head off to the many nice bars and restaurants in the area. You'd be hard pressed to find a hotel of this standard for the same reasonable price - we'll definitely stay there again next time we visit Barcelona. Review #97:Stayed in this hotel in june for the bank holidy. Nice hotel great location for shopping long distance walk to the beach. On arrival reception booked us in not very helpful. Room service never wanted to change bed sheets had to promt them to do. Roof area is very small tiny with a small pool and not a big seating area first come first serve basis. Fat guy with glasses at reception made my transfer leave without us beacause he never called up to room........totally div couldn't speak much englis, not best hotel will deff never go back!!!!!!!!!!! ! Review #98:We can only praise the hotel and agree it is a wonderful place to stay. Four of us went last weekend and had a great time. The hotel is immaculate, staff very friendly and they even upgraded my parents to a superior room as it was my dad's 60 birthday present. The rooms are fantastic and my husband and I stayed in a standard room which was also very spacious with a great bathroom. The superior room had a jacuzzi bath and DVD and CD player extra and a much bigger bed. The breakfast was wonderful with so much choice and Barcelona is a great city. We all had fantastic tapas in the Taverna Mediteranian located next door to the America Hotel and the food and drink was very reasonable and also fantastic service. The roof top area of the hotel is wonderful and views good over the city and a great place to relax after a busy day sightseeing. Review #99:I stayed 6 nights wirh my girlfriend in Hotel Barcelona. A good Choice, because the service was exxelent. The rooms were clean everyday and very luxery. The staff was very helpfull and kind. A big plus is that you can take a Fiat 500 for four ours...for free! Also the rooftop swimmingpool was releaxed, but we didn't swim. Because it was a little bit to cold in Barcelna at the moment... I would suggest this Hotel to everybody. Greetings Nikky van Eijk & Diana Derks (from Holland)", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The room was delightful and the staff couldn't really do enough for us. My wife wasn't well during our stay so we had room service for breakfast - superb. The \"Grill\" restaurant does need to improve it's menu - the hotel suffers from having a top of the range restaurant (very dear) and the \"Grill\" restaurant which only really serves basic snacks. The hotel could do with a mid-range restaurant serving pasta, steak etc to be a complete package. The walk through the park to the Spanish Steps is lovely (though not advised at night) - taxi's to and from are not too dear however. We enjoyed being a little way from the hustle of the city centre. Overall a really beautiful hotel - recommended. Review #1:We enjoyed very much the hotel nice swimming pool to relax after or before discovering Rome delicious breakfast and friendly concierge we were upgraded and the room we stayed in had been completely refurbished and was very comfortable the hotel is a bit far from the city centre but they have a shuttle or you take the cab not expensive around 10 euros and to my knowledge it is the only LHW in Rome which has a swimming pool Review #2:We stayed at the Aldrovandi Palace in May 2008 for the second time - the first time was in July 2005. Since our last visit there has been significant refurbishment and the results are fantastic! The reason for choosing the hotel again was to have a pool to relax by when we weren't sight-seeing. The pool area is lovely and the hotel provide enormous yellow towels and extremely comfortable loungers to use while sunbathing. The only downside of the pool area is that there are so many trees surrounding it you end up dodging the shade all day if you want to get a tan. There is a lot of sun though - you just need to move every now and then to stay in it. Our room was huge and had a big mirrored wall on one side which made it feel even bigger. The bathroom was enormous and we both loved it - there was a huge separate walk-in shower with a rain shower head and the whole bathroom was spotless. The hotel is expensive for \"extras\" - for example a 75cl bottle of water by the pool costs 6 Euros, and buffet breakfast is 33 Euros per person, but it is a 5 star hotel and the prices are no more extortionate than other similar hotels. We booked through Expedia and got a really good rate and then we minimised what we spent while we were there. It's easy enough to get water and breakfast outside of the hotel if you want to keep your costs down. Overall I would definitely recommend the hotel. It isn't cheap but it has an air of luxury about it and you get really well looked after. It's also in a nice quiet area of Rome which means you feel as though you are coming back to an oasis when you return from your sight-seeing each day. Review #3:Fortunate to have 3 nights on a business trip at Aldrovandi Palace. Rooms are better than average for Italy (I know it's 5 stars but anyone having been to Italy will know what I mean!) - a deserved member of the Leading Hotels of The World! Beautiful courtyard and great service. Villa Borghese is wonderful and, whilst not in the heart of the city, the hotel provides a free shuttle to the Spanish Steps for convenient walking (v close to Trevi Fountain & then 10-15min walk to the Colloseum). Not that I paid but wouldn't be cheap but would recommend for that 'special' weekend! ! Review #4:I stated here recently for 2 nights for a weekend break in Rome with my wife. The Hotel is quite lovely inside and the suite we had was spacious, luxurious and everything you would want from a 5 star hotel. Staff were efficient but lacked any kind of friendliness, which you sometime get in upmarket hotels. The hotel is located on the far side of the Borghese gardens from the main centre of Rome i.e. the Corso, Spanish steps etc and is therefore a 25 minute walk through parkland to the crowds and site seeing areas. The walk is quite pleasant through the park but we were recommended not to do it at night. The hotel has a shuttle bus service but we didn't use this so I can't comment on it. The only questionable element to the hotel are the dining facilities. They have 2 options, the first is a Michelin star restaurant called \"Baby\", which looked very nice but only had a set menu when we were there that was 180 Euros per person. The other option was something called the \"Grill\" but it did not in fact grill anything other than sandwiches, in other words it was a fancy snack bar. Cost is a relative thing but 180 Euros per person is too pricey for us, so got a taxi into town but it might be acceptable to others, so make your own mind up. Overall a really nice place, would I return, probably not just due to the hassle of having to get taxis everywhere after dark. Review #5:This was our second stay in Rome and at the Aldrovandi Palace. We fell in love with Rome in August and decided to return to this wonderfully friendly hotel for New Year. The only disappointment was that the pool was closed and the outside bar area was deserted. A couple of patio heater would have been ideal for sitting out in the evening. We spent New Years Eve at the conciege's suggestion at Harry's Bar and had a wonderful and expensive evening there seeing in 2007. Fantastic!!! The hotel is fab and the conciege knowledgable and helpful, making suggestions for day trips and fab restaurants. I cannot recoomed the hotel highly enough. as a base for Rome. Yes the rooms may be small, however with all of Rome a 5 minute taxi ride away, you'll spend little time in it. The best venue for dinner in Rome is the rooftop restaurant at the Hashe view of Rome and the amazing cuisine. It'll cost you a months mortgage but you'll never forget the view of Rome at dusk and the foods fabulous. I threw a few extra euros into the Trevi fountain to make sure we return to Rome soon and when we do we'll stay at the Aldrovandi Palace. Review #6:the hotel itself is really a luxury hotel but there were too many things that were unacceptable: I booked a deluxe room on a high floor with pool view but got a superior room on the first floor with view on the car parking area, the TV in my room although branded Bang and Olufson did not work, the yogurt offered at the breakfast buffet was expired.... Review #7:This was our third trip to Rome but our first with the children and our first to this hotel - but it won't be our last. Can't praise it highly enough, the staff were great - very polite and helpful and the rooms - although not overly large were well decorated and very very clean. We included the breakfast cost when booking the trip and were expecting a small continental affair, but the choice was good and included cooked aswell. The pool area, though not huge was very clean and felt suprisingly secluded, with pool attendants always on hand to provide you with a row of sunbeds should you need them. The hotel is in a good position just across the road from the borghese gardens which are nice to walk through to get to the main attractions although the hotel shuttle offered a fast and friendly service to the centre of things should you need it (booking with the concierge the previous evening is recommended if you require a morning service). All in all we had a fabulous time and will definitely return to Rome and the Aldrovandi. Review #8:In making my travel plans...I discovered I was going to be \"forced\" to spend 4 days in Rome....... my first though was uggg Rome in August ... (I had been here a few times before staying in a private residence). So with the help of TripAdvisor I set out to find a hotel. As I had just spent a week in the mountains, 10 days by the sea I was not going to end this holiday on an unhappy note ..... the criteria for my search was .... somewhere off the park, and a swimming pool....... the result was the Alrovandi Villa Borghese .... Thank you TripAdvisor ...what a wonder experience........ the location was great ... it is either a 15 minute walk through a beautiful park or a short (free) van ride to the Spanish Stairs... the Staff was wonderful ........... Professional, helpful and even good for some laughs. My room was clean and happy and I slept very well.....and normally I am a poor sleeper. The breakfast buffet was an endless table of food ..... everything from scrambled eggs to Mozzarella, tomato and basil. The Pool and surrounding were the perfect siesta to wandering the street of Rome in the morning. I did not eat at the hotel famed restaurant Baby ...but I did eat in the Grill Room ....the food was excellent...but the menu lacked imagination ... This is a hotel for people who enjoy what is offered, so if you are on a budget, worried about money or who enjoy their holidays find faults.... you are best to go elsewhere I did lie in my title...I have one regret...not staying here longer Review #9:We were a little worried about previous reviews after we had booked the Aldrovandi, but there was no need to worry at all. The hotel was lovely with nice spacious rooms. The staff were excellent and very friendly. The breakfast buffet was fantastic, just what you needed for a long day ahead of sightseeing and walking. There was a courtesy car from the hotel to the centre every hour which was great. It does not matter that the hotel is out a few minutes from the centre as the courtesy car or indeed the lovely walk through the gardens to get to the centre was fine. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rome. Review #10:My husband and i just got back from a 2 week vacation in Italy. We were in Rome for three nights and stayed at the Aldrovandi. It could not have been better. The staff is warm, friendly, and always ready to help you. As an example of just how helpful and accommodating they were at one point I asked (I think his name might have been Mario, not certain) if he knew where they bought the tablecloths they use in the breakfast room. I loved them and had been looking for something like them for years. He came right out from behind the desk and asked me to show him which i meant. We went upstairs so he could get a look. Then he recommended two places in Rome to try. They helped us numerous times with dinner plans, directions, really anything! Hotel Aldrovandi seems a little out of the way in that there is not much to walk to around them. The shuttle to the Spanish Steps made all the difference. They run every half hour until 10pm in both directions. I also loved the rooms. They were beautiful, clean, elegant, and the bed is comfortable which i am a stickler about. We absolutely have no complaints and only praise for this hotel and would absolutely stay there again! As an aside, make sure to check out the Borghese Gallery which is close by when you are there, you'll need reservations. Review #11:this 5 star hotel was rather disappointing. The pictures of the website suggest something spectacular but the reality is a bit different. location is very good, near villa borghese, and the hotel still has a \"grand\" image but there are sign of tiredness all around. My \"superior\" room (ie the more basic category) was rather small and not particularly pleasant. Actually it even had two problems: the window did not open and the toilet flush did not work properly ,so that you had to fiddle with the control to make it stop. At > 300Euro per night I think one could find something better, even in Rome when often hotel room prices verge on the absurd Review #12:We-wife and I-arrived in Rome late April and checked in to hotel near Spanish Steps. Unfortunately the temp in Rome was about 85 degrees F and air conditioning which had been stated as feature in website was not available until May 1.We did not feel we could sleep well on street fron with windows ope to street nois and had been flying for many hours, so called and visited the Aldrovandi where I had a reservation for 4 days later. They offered to take us that night or the next; a/c was working. We returned to first hotel and tried to get them to release us but had to pay 2 nights stay or not, so we stayed that night and moved to other next day. Aldrovandi is a great hotel with all facilities in a residential part of Rome next to Borghese Park. They have free shuttle service to the Sp. Steps each hour. Lovely outdoor pool, garden and courtyard. Breakfast was best we had in 3 weeks in Europe. Staff wonderful and had upgraded suite that was gorgeous. Was a pleasure to stay there 4 nights. Review #13:A classy hotel with all the trappings to befit the 5 star \u2018Leading Hotels of the World\u2019 tag. It also has prices to match though we managed to get a very good deal by booking through Alitalia. That said, breakfast (described as a \u2018light buffet\u2019) is on top of the room rate and is a deterrent \u20ac33 per person per day. There are no nearby shops or restaurants (the hotel's own is in the very top bracket both for prices and quality), but the hotel, which is at the north end of the Villa Borghese park, is not that far from the central parts of the city, and the hotel runs a free, reliable and efficient shuttle service every half hour in each direction to and from the Spanish Steps (the same journey is about \u20ac7 by taxi). This only holds 8, however, so needs to be booked ahead, and the first one into town is 10.00 a.m. Unusually for a hotel in the city the hotel has an excellent pool (though this is so well shaded it is actually surprisingly cool). Service is impeccable and very professional. The rooms are spacious, handsomely appointed, and with all you would expect at this level. We were surprised that throughout our stay we had problems with the water \u2013 we had to run it for about 10 minutes to get hot water, and most days it was either very discoloured or speckled with bits. A top class hotel, though with very high prices unless you can get a good deal, and if you want a pool without being a long way out, this is highly recommended. Review #14:We've just had 3 nights in this fantastic Rome hotel. The hotel is expensive but we decided to treat ourselves and by booking and paying well in advance with the Leading Hotels of the World Group we got rooms at a fraction of the rack rate. And the hotel is beatiful - very classy but not pretentious, great staff and service, great rooms and a lovely garden with a delightful swimming pool. The hotel is a liittle out of the centre which made it feel much more relaxed and a great place to return to after a hot day's sight-seeing. The hotel provides an excellent shuttle service to and from the Spanish Steps. We were on a room rate which included breakfasts which we really enjoyed - good choice and top quality. Bar drinks and room service etc was extremely expensive so we avoided buying anything extra in the hotel. The restaurant looked wonderful but the prices were very high. We might have treated ourselves had we not been with the children. However the hotel recommended a nearby restaurant which proved to be perfect - the Pagaroma. This hotel is expensive and at the top of the range but it is wonderful and made our stay in Rome an absolute delight. Review #15:Mario the concierge was incredibly helpful. The breakfast very morning was delicious . The shuttle to the spanish steps was so easy, not crowded, we never waited. The room was elegant, clean, and we loved the Molton Brown bath products. I can't wait to return, I was so pleasantly welcomed during my 4 night stay at the Aldrovandi, Review #16:We stayed there with my boyfriend for 2 nights, but even in such short period this place impressed us really a lot. First of all it has perfect location - just in the heart of Villa Borghese - in a peaceful zone, but very close to the center, just 10 min walking and you are in Piazza Spagna. The room was VERY spacious, perfectly equipped, clean, with new furniture and modern technics. We had both shower and bath, that is really comfortable. Breakfast was also included to the price and I can say that is one on the most rich breakfast I've ever seen - all food was really fresh, especially pastry and of course noone can re,ain hungry after such breakfast. For the guests of the hotel there was provided a shuttle bus that takes you every 30 min to the city center and then in evening brings you back. Probably the only thing that I would change in that hotel - is the Internet - it has a supplementary fee, but at the same time for Rome this thing is more than normal. Review #17:Early autumn short trip to one of the great cities. 5 star elegance here that some might find 'traditional' in style - but that I liked, as it had not succumbed to a 'contemporary' makeover. Quality finishes throughout. The main plus point of Aldrovandi Villa Borghese, in it's park setting 5 minutes Cab ride from The Spanish Steps, is it's staff. The people there are first rate and service exemplary. Reception, through to room maids: all deserve a mention. Breakfast is absolutely civilised - and the room elegant & very well run; a fine start to the day. A final thanks to Oliver Glowig and his team in the restaurant - fine dining par-excellence. A special occasion meal certainly, but gourmands should note - very good cooking here! Review #18:On arrival the hotel was stunning with a very friendly welcome and thorough check-in. We were personally escorted to our room, provided with all the details about the hotel and left to enjoy an excellent stay. Staff were always very happy to help with any queries we had and spoke very good English. Diran (the Lobby barman) is a great guy and made lush cocktails - highly recommended! Room was lovely - deep bath, lots of complementary toiletries, mini-bar, good tv, nice lightling, very comfy bed! Breakfast was good - usual continental style plus scrambled eggs and bacon, cereals, fresh fruit and champagne! Breakfast room overlooked a gorgeous looking swimming pool and garden terrace. Hotel was about a 25min walk (or 5 min courtesy mini-bus) away from Piazza de Spagna. We used the mini-bus throughout our stay as it was raining most of the time, which saved us a lot of money in taxi fares. Chauffeurs were always friendly and helpful. We had an absolutely fantastic time during our visit to Rome and the Aldrovandi Hotel was the cherry on the cake - superb! Review #19:This is a well laid out hotel in a nice setting on the edge of Borghese park. The main plus point is the helpfulness of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms, the place itself is elegant looking but a bit tired now. We stayed in Feb on a 60% discount but it was still \u00a3160 a night. There were only news channels in English. There were no refreshment facilities in the rooms. The mini bar (I accept most are expensive) was outrageous 10 euros for a packet of crisps and 15 euros for a half bottle of beer etc. Whilst there is a shuttle every half hour to the spanish steps this is no good if you want to go north of the City, basically everywhere is a taxi ride. Albeit the main restuarant was closed the grill bar was rubbish, 40 euros for 2 pieces of scrawny chicken and saute ptoatoes. Wi-fi should be free but is was 9 euros a day with a download limit. Review #20:My wife (Nicole) and I stayed at the Aldrovandi at the end of summer and I've been meaning to post a review since. Fantastic hotel. Close to the centre. Beautiful setting. AMAZING FOOD. All round first class experience. I'm usually very picky about service, but I must say - it was exceptional. Very impressed. We'll definitely return to this hotel for both pleasure and business trips in the future. Highly recommended. Review #21:Elegant, special, a benchmark for when I am looking for something a bit more luxurious. The rooms were spacious, bathroom somewhere you wanted to stay ad soak for hours. Fantastic Michelin star restaurant excellent bar staff and a lovely pool ad seating area. Pool could be a bit cold so let's say if you're looking for a refreshing dip in a plunge pool this wil be it!! A bus that takes you into the centre and brings you back, means if you are tired or laden down with designer bags there is no need for the lovely walk through the famous Borghese parc and it's gardens. Choose a pool or garden view room as the ones facing the road can be a bit noisy especially if the open air club is on! Loved it and look forward to bringing him who is not so romantic with me one day to share my experience! Review #22:We stayed here for 5 nights and it was incredible. The room was lovely, although not much space was left after they crammed in an enormous bed. The bathroom was gorgeous with an awesome shower + lovely Molton Brown goodies. Overall, the hotel was quite formal, but still relaxing. The concierge was brilliant - every recommendation or booking was a good one. The pool area was nice, but in shade for a large portion of the day; however, the pool restaurant was lovely. Breakfast was spot on; however, the 'grill' restaurant (not the Michelin star one) was really, really poor - it felt like we were eating in someone's hall. Finally, as you would expect, mini-bar or room service charges were astronomical. Still, I would definitely return one day. Review #23:This is indeed a gracious hotel in a lovely setting albeit outside the city core, but in fact within a short taxi ride to most locations. If reserved in advance, you can always get their shuttle service to Via Veneto or the Spanish Steps. The refreshingly quiet loacation and their wonderful oasis, a sumptuous garden with a large pool, make this hotel unique and definitely worth it during Rome's hot summer days. The staff was 100% efficient and helpful. The breakfast buffet was ample. But the rooms, pretty as they were, are difficult to navigate with two people in the bedroom trying to move around. For us, this small inconvenience was outweighed by the other factors. RG Canada Review #24:Booked this place as it is one of the few hotels in Rome in our price range that had an outdoor swimming pool as along with sight seeing we wanted some R & R in the sun. Unless you seeking a hotel with a pool I would recommend you stay elsewhere. There is no way the rooms are 5 star , more like 3* we cabbed it everywhere as one walks so much in Rome seeing the sights that the extra 20 min across the park did not seem appealing. The staff were all very good service was 5* and the setting 5* but the rooms are NOT and you will be dissapointed. Review #25:First of all, I disagree with many of the things the dubai reviewer said about this hotel. It sounds like this reviewer has never been to places like New York City, where smallish rooms are the norm. We thought the hotel was very beautiful and our rooms were lovely. It is definitely worth it to ask for a room facing the pool/courtyard as the main road is right at the front of the hotel. It is a very expensive, old-school elegance hotel - much like the Del Coronado in California (which also has very small rooms, BTW). If you stay at a place like this, you can expect to pay a lot for everything. While we weren't exactly charging up the pool drinks and room service because of this, we still really enjoyed the beauty and elegance of the hotel. We thought the staff was very friendly, especially the doormen. The front desk staff is a little more reserved but also very helpful. The location of this hotel is the biggest downside - you can't really walk anywhere from here. If you need to find a store, take a left from the front entrance and follow the train tracks until you reach civilization - my husband and I found a great grocery store finally so we could have some snacks in our room one day. However, if I were you, I would pick up what you need before you return to the hotel. The shuttle is a nice amenity - you have to reserve your space so be prepared to take cabs if you can't get on one and are ready to go somewhere. I would recommend this hotel, but would not stay there again ONLY because of the location. It would be more fun to be on the Via Venetta or other place within close walking of Spanish steps or at least a subway stop. Review #26:We, a family of four, stayed at the Palace at the end of August to mark a significant birthday. A junior suite and a twin room were booked and were ready for us on arrival and next door to each other as requested. The rooms were ok despite the fact that they were on the road side of the hotel rather than the garden and were low down. But we didn't come to Rome to spend time in the rooms! A bottle of champagne and bowl of fruit in the suite were a nice touch. The noise wasn't too bad at all. But we do live in a city. As everyone agrees, the pool is great. Unbeatable to have this in the city during the summer. The pool attendants were very helpful indeed. The Concierge function was excellent. Could not have been more helpful. They recommended and booked local restaurants and the Villa Borghese and were friendly with it. I wonder if there is something about treating them with respect and friendliness? Similarly the reception staff were efficient and helpful. I did note that when a few guests acted in a superior manner the atmosphere got a little frosty. The shuttle service to the Spanish Steps is great although the walk through the park is lovely. The lift back up the hill is appreciated however. Don't forget to book it at reception in advance as it is popular. The only negative point was that the hotel restaurant 'Baby' was closed for a private wedding party one evening. Not a major burden given the good restaurants near by, but hotel restaurants should be open for guests by definition. Also breakfast is ridiculously expensive. Instead take the shuttle to the Spanish Steps and have breakfast upstairs in the cafe opposite. It has a great view of all the comings and goings on the Steps. Not a cheap place to stay, but we concluded that it was worth the money and we would definitely stay there again. Review #27:First class treatment all the way As we arrived early they let us check in and gave us details on the facilities and major sites of Rome Our room was given a complimentary upgrade and when we returned in the evening there was a complimentary bottle of wine All the staff went out of their way to be helpful and the service was top class in the restaurant As we were leaving for the airport late in the afternoon the hotel gave us a late checkout and provided changing facilities to enable us to use the pool area I stay in hotels quite a lot and although not cheap this hotel has excellent customer service and staff Review #28:The reason that led me to choose the Aldrovandi Villa Borghese is the unique location. The hotel is located just in front of Villa Borghese so you don\u00b4t have any pollution or noise from the traffic. In order to reach the center you have to option : you can use the shuttle service which is offered complimentary and takes you directely to the Spanish Steps or you can take a 15 minutes walking through Villa Borghese Gardens. I got a wonderful Deluxe Room with a nice view over the park , the room size was quite huge with a stunning marble bathroom featuring a Mirror TV. Another plus of the room was the Minibar filled up with the most delicious snacks and beverages. It is very rare to find such an outstanding selection. I stayed 2 nights and I had enough time to soak up the sun in the beautiful garden with a nice swimming pool. From the swimming pool I had the chance to see the terrace of the gourmet restaurant Oliver Glowig so I\u00b4ve asked to the waiter to give me a menu and I found the menu very tempting with a resonable price. So I have booked a table for my mother and I for the same night and we got a real unique gourmet experience. The food was delicious, the atmosphere amazing and also the courtesy of the staff was a plus. I had the chance to meet the chef Oliver Glowig because apparently he greeds personally each guest that come to his restaurant. Very kind!! We had the chance to experience also the lavish buffet breakfast which has been served served in a very bright veranda overlooking the swimming pool. I have also to mention the courtesy of the Concierge that took great care of us recommending the best places to go in town. It was a real unique experience and I am looking forward to go back very soon next Spring! ! Review #29:A lovely hotel with a fabulous pool and 2 Michelen stars in the restaurant. The setting is unique and one of the best pools in Rome city. There's a shuttle bus every half hour to the Spanish steps so you're on via Condotti in minutes. The rooms are very luxurious and comfortable. The only negative - the breakfast room doesn't do this hotel any favours and is out of keeping with the rest of the hotel. Review #30:We were greeted warmly on our arrival at the Aldrovandi on a steaming August afternoon. The charming Patrick escorted us to our lovely adjoining rooms on the third floor. Flinging open the shutters we encountered the most delightful view of the gardens and pool. Aware of the late hour and some of the comments I had read on Tripadvisor I enquired as to the possibility of a swim, and was delighted to hear that the pool is open 24 hrs, the only caveat being, there are no pool attendants after 7pm and so you need to take your own towel down with you if you wish to swim after that. Whilst the kids cooled off in the pool, which they had completely to themselves, we sat in the wonderful shaded gardens sipping chilled Pinot Grigio and nibbling on the complimentary pizzatinis. The surroundings really are exquisite, and exactly the situation in which you would like to find yourself, after a tiring day. The only problem we encountered during our stay was the difficulty in tearing ourselves away from this little Oasis to get down to the serious business of sightseeing! The complimentary shuttle bus was excellent, leaving every hour and dropping off at the foot of the Spanish Steps. They also pick up from here at 25 past the hour. I also thoroughly recommend strolling through the Villa Borghese gardens which is a lovely way to start the day and takes no longer than twenty minutes if you don't stop along the way. The concierge were absolutely first class throughout our stay,really helpful with information and restaurant reservations. Whilst there we celebrated our sons 18th birthday and on returning to our rooms that day they had supplied a beautifully presented tray of chilled champagne and petit four and a birthday card. The restaurant they recommended, Osteria d'Antiquaria, was superb and they even arranged a Birthday cake ! If you are planning a trip to Rome during the summer months I really can't recommend The Aldrovandi Palace highly enough. Review #31:My husband and I ended a 3 week European holiday with a 5 day stay at the Aldrovandi. This hotel truly earns its five star rating. The building and decor are coolly elegant, modern yet richly Italian in design and \"feel\". Both the public spaces and the rooms were immaculately clean and well-maintained. They offer a wonderful turn down service in the evenings that makes you feel even more catered to. The breakfast buffet was simply amazing - abundant, varied and delicous food, beautifully presented and offered with gracious, attentive service. Speaking of service, I can't say enough about the staff - we Americans could learn alot from the studying the staff - at all levels - at this hotel. The concierge Mario was especially helpful, professional and just incredibly service-oriented. The shuttle service was great and being out of the wonderful but chaotic center of Rome was very relaxing as was staying in the midst of the beautiful Borghese Gardens. Also, we totally enjoyed the outdoor spaces, which were not at all for exclusive use of guests of Baby, contrary to another reviewer's comment, and we were able to use the shuttle service whenever we needed/wanted it. Review #32:This hotel is old first of all, so are the rooms that feel like a three star or poor 4 star. We've paid the price as it was a top 5 star which made my dissapointment with the hotel bigger. Staff is...hm...ok, some of them. The great restaurant within the hotel did not work and we have had to use the hotel one. The waiters did not want to put 2 tables together for our group of 12 eve there was nobody else at the restaurant - they did not want to disturb other non visible guests???? We ended up (our comapny CEO and Regional Director actually) putting the tables together so we can sit. then they went out of wine we drunk, service oh my god not good. Not to forget that we have called once from the city to cancell dinner as we wanted to stay out and then we've changed our mind and called within next 5 minutes that we will not cancell. The receptionist or whoever picked up actually screamed at my colleague that this cannot be done and they've refuesed our dinner! Ended up in a great restaurant in the city afterwards which was even better then the lousy hotel restaurant. Everything we asked was a problem, but even if it was I do not see why to tell it in front of the guest???? It was witner so we did not try the pool although it looks nice. I did not notice a great location ecuase simply everything was far. I would NOT reccomend this hotel for the price they ask for and I would not go bac there if I was in Rome. Review #33:I stayed for 2 nights at Aldrovandi Palace in November and loved the refurbishment. The Lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are fantastic, they even have TVs in the bathrooms. Regarding the location, it is a very quiet place and just a few minutes with the transfer from the Spanish Steps. By the way, transfer is gently provided by the hotel every half hour which helps a lot. The restaurant is amazing, I had a wonderful dinner with a view of the beautiful garden the Hotel has. Breakfast was delicious, all the Hotel Staff definitely made our stay more enjoyable,everyone is very charismatic. I strongly recomend this Hotel and I will definitely stay there again during my next trip to Rome! Review #34:My partner and I stayed at the Aldrovandi Palace for 6 nights and I can honestly say it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It is a little out of the way however the hotel has a shuttle bus that takes you to the Spanish steps and picks you up. From there you can catch the metro to all the main sites which I would advise doing as taxi's are very expensive. There is also a tram stop outside the hotel which is handy. We booked a king size room however we were given a room with two single beds pushed together. We asked to be moved and we were straight away. They upgraded us to a superior room as they were fully booked. This room was lovely, it had a very big bathroom and massive bed and it even had a TV in the bathroom mirror. Some of the staff were a little abrupt at times but I think its just the way they are. The majority of them couldn't have been more helpful. I'm not one for name dropping but a guy named Alessio was especially helpful and genuinely interested in how we were spending our days. We had breakfast included which was good as the food and drink was VERY expensive (a bottle of water was 7 euros). It was very nice and the waiting staff were great. The coffee is EXCELLENT! The main thing that was good about this hotel was that it had a swimming pool, so of an afternoon after a long day of sightseeing it was nice to just chillout. They give you a cushion for the sunbeds and a towel which made it even more relaxing. All in all we had a fantstic time however bare in mind it is expensive. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a relaxing little hideaway in a touristy place. Review #35:I spent a lovely romantic getaway at the Aldrovandi Villa Borghese. The atmosphere is very cosy and intimate. I experienced a silent and discrete elegance and luxury service. Enjoyed especially the garden with exotic plants and flowers, i ordered a glass of champagne rose surrounded in a magical atmosphere. This was the first perfect drink before dinner. I ate at the Oliver Glowig, the restaurant of the hotel, the food was delicious we stayed there till sooo late. Our room was on the third floor very quiet clean and comfortable Review #36:The Aldrovandi Palace is luxury hotel abutting Villa Borghese. The service staff are friendly and helpful. While my husband attended business meetings, I toured the city, with much guidance from the concierge. The hourly shuttle to the Spanish Steps makes it easy to get to the heart of Rome and see all the sites you go to Rome to see. The magnificent Borghese Gallery is a short walk from the hotel. The room was lovely, comfortable and clean. The lobby bar is quite pleasant, as are its servers. Our meal at Baby was exquisite. The price for breakfast is admittedly steep, but that seems to be the norm at most top-notch hotels, including those in the United States. Taxis in Rome are expensive, but the shuttle helps allay that cost. Several in our group departed at the same early hour for the flight home so the hotel arranged for a mini-bus, which was there promptly at 6 a.m. and got us to the airport in plenty of time. All in all, staying at the Aldrovandi Palace made my husband's business trip seem less like work and made my Roman holiday very special. Review #37:Very nice hotel ,frendly service-minded staff from the doorman,concierge,reception,bar,restaurant,breakfast-staff,houskeeping ,everybody is doing an exellent job.Nice big rooms,very nice bathrooms,lovely breakfast including sparkling wine!We could not try the Michelin star restaurant, we had our baby with us on the visit. Lovely pool area ,could not try too early not warm enough. Shuttle service to the Spanish steps every half our ,is a very nice service!! We will come back next time , to Aldrovandi ! ! Review #38:I do not generally comment on hotels, but this superb, newly refurbished - all in sparkly Italian marble hotel - inspired me to write a review! My teenage daughter and I have just returned from a five day stay at the Aldrovandi Palace . I booked after reading the various reviews on internet and I'm pleased to confirm that it was an excellent choice. One of the best aspect of the hotel is the service. From the doorman to the room service personnel, everyone was so friendly and professional. The service is personal and seamlessly attentive, the rooms are spotless and are experience worth. Giuseppe at concierge and his inside advices are impressed in my mind. Bedrooms offer supreme comfort, with stylish furniture. Advanced technology includes controlled air conditioning and Bang & Olufsen TV sets. The breakfast offered a fine selection of warm and cold food, fruit and a traditional Italian pastry. The breakfast room is absolutely gorgeous. Best restaurant in the city! The suits are not huge, but the garden and the swimming poll beats all in Rome . Free shuttle service, made my daughter happy, because it was vital for her frequent shopping excursions near Piazza di Spagna. Its palm garden and the Sorentino coast cuisine in the heart of Rome emphasises the holyday mood . It is within a walking distance of Villa Giulia, where my daughter and me enjoyed in of the most remarkable masterpieces of Etruscan art. Simply wonderful! Review #39:Myself and my husband have just returned from a wonderful couple of days in Rome. We stayed at the Aldrovandi Palace Hotel. It was fantastic, it had a sense of old world grandeur. The staff were very welcoming and spoke excellent English. Our rate which we booked through Otel.com included breakfast and it was excellent. I would advise getting a taxi from the airport if there is more than one as its much quicker and works out roughly the same as a train and taxi. We took three Angel Tours. The First to the Vatican was fantastic we had an Irish guide called Anne Marie she was brillant. The second tour was the Heart of Rome, it was good but unfortunately the Pantheon was closed unexpectately so the tour was cut short. The Third tour we took was to the Colesseum and Roman Forum we were the only two people on the tour it was great - a private tour! I can't say enough for Angel Tours, take one you won't be disappointed. Review #40:Absolutely pleasant stay! Walking across the park about 10 minutes is even better then staying in the very centre! The rooms are very cleen and stylish! More then that inside you'll find Bang@Olufsen TV system, wall-size mirrow, mirrow with TV(!) in the bathroom. Service is at it's best. Can definately recommend this hotel! Review #41:The Aldrovandi Palace hotel has been the right choice: 4 days with my boyfriend to relax and discover Rome. Located in a chic area of Rome but still 10 min walking from Spanish Steps and the rest of the historical city center, the hotel offers even a shuttle service up to late hours to the center and back. The service was great, very kind and helpful personnel, the room was stunning with a great bathroom (TV in the mirror too!!). Moreover the hotel has a peaceful and chic swimming pool to relax, where a great garden bar serves fresh and tasteful lunches. On top of this, in the hotel you can dine at one of the best restaurants of the city \"Baby\", with Michelin starred chef Alfonso!! Great stay, hope to be back soon...the hotel was so good that it was really hard to get out and visit the city! ! Review #42:We returned from a week stay in Rome Italy.Our accommodations were at the Aldrovandi Palace. We were treated like king and queen. staff was amazing. Service was awesome, restaurant over the top awesomeChef Oliver Wolig meals were amazing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Rome. Review #43:We stayed only 2 nights but managed to enjoy every aspect of this fine hotel. The staff was most helpful to our every request and made the four of us feel special. We particularly enjoyed the staff at the main floor restaurant and bar as they were very warm and engaging while being very professional as they served our food and drink. We think anyone wishing to be in the Villa Borghese local would do well to stay here. Review #44:We arrived on the 14th of October and the driver took us to a very nice green area (Borghese Gardens) where the Aldrovandi is located (ten minutes walk from the Hotel to Piazza del Popolo and shuttle service all day long to Piazza Spagna). The Hotel is a Palazzo, we stayed in a very nice suite with views of the pool and gardens, classic style mixed with plasma and bang & olufsen music equipment (nice blend). Casual pool restaurant was good and the Baby (1 Michelin star) was beyond expectations in service, food quality, presentation and wines (10/10). During dinner we were introduce to the Chef Alfonso Iaccarino who also has a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant called Don Alfonso in Sant Agata (Amalfi). Concierge and reception were very reliable and can't tell you anything about the breakfast due that we just had cappuccinos in the room every morning. I recommend to go at least once to Mario in Via delle Vite, great food, service and ambience (lunch or dinner). Don't miss the Vatican museum but spend your money in getting a proper guide and be there at 7:30 am, you will be able to enter at 8:00 am and visit the Sistine Chapel with no more than 10 people (when we crossed it again at 11:00 to go to St. Peter's Basilic, there were more than 400 people easily). Ciao Italia, we will be back! Carlos and Natalia Review #45:We stayed here for 5 nights and loved every instant. Fine blend of friendliness and hospitality professionalism. Everyone is alert and eager to provide you with a great vacation experience. This hotel is simply beautiful. Our room was elegant, airy and spacious. Marble bathroom is perfectly equipped. We were also lucky to experience the culinary delights of the 2 star Michelin rated Chef de Cuisine Gastronomique, Oliver Glowig. Food and service were absolute delight. Service was just impeccable, in every part of this magnificent marble hotel. Kudos! I am already booking another stay for April. Review #46:Ihave tried for two week to get a reservation to take advantage of their special to a 4th night free. It would be less expensive going direct so I have not booked with expedia. I have tried for two weeks without a returned e-mail and none have come back. I want to stay here since I am traveling with my 11 year oild son and would like to take advantage of the pool.The e-mails have not been returned so it must be the staff that is ignoring the request. You can see when someone is online and they have chosen to neglect my inquiry. Review #47:My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights recently in June 2011. We chose this hotel because we wanted luxury accommodation and an opportunity to relax at a pool. We were not disappointed at all. This is a wonderful hotel located on the outskirts of the tranquil Villa Borghese gardens. It is a short cab ride of a few minutes to any of the attractions in Rome. Staff were friendly and helpful and particularly Mario at the front desk Rooms are large and bright and the pool and gardens are a wonderful retreat after a day of hectic touring in the heat. The rooms and gardens are quiet and peaceful Food prices are way way up there so we did not eat in the restaurant although it is apparently one of the finest in Rome. Breakfast was included and was excellent. Would definitely stay here again particularly in the summer months. Review #48:We've just returned from a wonderful four day break in Rome, staying at the Aldrovandi. If you\u2019re looking for the modern, ultra-hip five star experience there are plenty of options in this great city, the Exedra, the Aleph etc. But if you want the five-star European luxury hotel done like it used to be then you could so a lot worse than the Aldrovandi. When I\u2019ve stayed in Rome before it\u2019s always been in the city centre but one of the best things about this lovely hotel is the fact that you\u2019re about 4-5 minutes taxi ride from the tumult of Roma, on the outskirts of the Villa Borghese. The hotel runs an hourly shuttle to the Piazza del Spagna. But we either took taxis or enjoyed the 20 minute walk across the park- either to the Spanish Steps or to the Piazza del Popolo, enjoying the incredible views over the city before descending into the piazza. I can honestly say we couldn\u2019t fault the service at the Aldrovandi- from check in to check out. The concierges were unfailingly helpful, suggesting and reserving restaurants. Some of the other comments here about rude or difficult staff could not be more different from our experience. Our room was on the small size but incredibly comfortable (with a park view) and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was good- maybe a little lacking in variety but fine. I can\u2019t comment on the restaurant- Baby- as we ate out every night. One example of the Aldrovandi\u2019s service sums up why we enjoyed it so much. Our key was exactly that- a metal key on a heavy red tassel which we handed in every morning to the concierge, to be retrieved by him as he saw us come through the door, ready to hand over to us with a Buona Sera! Review #49:I've stayed @ this hotel three times in the past several years. Initially, I overlooked the staff's condescending & pompous attitude but have finally decided that I've had enough! On my most recent visit, I made multiple requests for information about a nearby museum as well as the operating hours of a special exhibit at the Villa Borghese---all that I rec'd were excuses & empty promises that someone would provide me w/the information 'later today'---this continued for 3 days in a row! In addition, the hotel's 'complimentary' Van service to & from the Spanish Steps was extremely disappointing & frustrating: reservations are required for this service due to the limited number of seats available. The process actually turned into a fierce competition among the Guests--each of whom were vying for the small number available seats for each trip. On two occasions, we were forced to pay for a 'taxi' to take us to the Spanish Steps since the Van was full hours in advance...and the front desk refused to reimburse us for our expense! There are many other hotels in Rome that offer exceptional accommodations, are in more convenient locations, provide outstanding service & sincerely appreciate their clientele...I will no longer patronize a hotel where I am treated so poorly. Review #50:I stayed at the Aldrovandi sadly for just one night. The way we were received was marvelous. We felt great, so much more after a very long flight. They were expecting us with beautiful rooms and a bottle of wine. It is situated in the middle of the park, surrounded by green lush. And quite near the piazza Spagna by a minivan that runs every half an hour from and to the hotel. Just a 5' trip. Very recomendable! Review #51:Some months ago I was planning to make a romantic trip with my wife in Rome. A friend of mine suggested my wife to organize our second honeymoon at Aldrovandi Palace. I must say that he was right. Incredible hospitality, wonderfull service, lovely room, friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere......what else ! If you're looking for the best. Aldrovandi Palace is simply the best ! Review #52:I would like to thank all the management staff and the on duty team. I had a wonderfull experience at the Aldrovandi Palace, everybody so friendly and eager to help. The courtesy service provided to the spanish steps, turned out to be marvellus.After a full day of wonderfull sight seeing and shopping, the van took our bags back to the hotel, and we stayed to have dinner in the area.Speaking of dinner, our first night at the Aldrovandi we had dinner at BaBy restaurant, it was simply divine! Aldrovandi Palace is full of sun shine and charisma, beautiful decor, excellent service.A very happy customer from Brazil! Ciao. Review #53:Wonderful hotel. As noted by others, the rooms are a little small. But they contain everything necessary for comfort. The staff do all they can to help, including calling our restaurant to say we were running late, finding vases and helping to trim flowers, offering to show us various rooms we might find comfortabe. The breakfast buffet is fantastic and set us up for the day. The free shuttle, every 15 minutes, to and from the Spanish Steps was a huge help. The only suggestion I would make is this: When we went the hotel was far from full and it seemed obvious that the better rooms on the higher floors were probably unoccupied. It would have been smart for the hotel to offer free upgrades to these rooms, as many hotels would have done. Review #54:caught a shuttle from the airport for 35 Euro, looks good from the outside nice introduction and induction to sign in and shown ton room. this was below standard for a 5* room, we had to ask 3 times for pillows and 20min wait for ice. vanity kit was empty every day in the bathroom. no complimentary water in the room and no free wifi, but there is a free business center for 30mins. the bar man is very good but the hotel lacks stock, they don't have a lot or ingredients for drink and we asked for one that was on the menu and couldn't do it as well as a mojito. on a brighter note the food is amazing from BABY (1 Michelin star) as well as the grill. pool area is nice however not much privacy we did have to get our own sun bed mats and request towels, the guy seemed to only bring them over as an when he felt like. i was over charged as we left i will check this with them soon. Review #55:A beautiful hotel with a classy lobby entrance. The hotel is away from the main city centre which is nice and its a short taxi ride away when needed. The staff were excellent, very helpful, friendly and polite. It cetainly made a bug difference to my stay and would be the reason why i would stay here when i visit rome again. Rooms are lovely, comfy beds and good amenities. Great place to stay and recommend this to business and leisure travellers. Review #56:I am so happy to see that others have enjoyed the Aldrovandi as much as we always have. We have visited many hotels in Italy and always look forward to going back to the Aldrovandi. It has two great attractions for us, namely location and staff. The location supplies peace and quiet and enough space for gardens and a pool, yet handy for the centre. It might not appeal to anybody wanting to be plunged into the thick of thing in the Rome Centre, but for us it is marvelous to return to a warm welcome after a day of intensive shopping and sight-seeing. The hourly shuttle is a boon, & a taxi from the centre should be about 10 Euros (or a little more at night). The walk via the Borghese Gardens is only 20 mins or so, but I wouldn't recommend it after dark . The gardens/zoo also make for a lovely early morning walk if (like me) you are up an hour before your partner has finshed her \"toilettte\". Contrary to some earlier comments, we have always found the staff to be welcoming, cheery and very helpful. Whilst they retain a small degreee of formality as becomes a 5* hotel, they are still more friendly than any other hotel I have stayed at. Can't wait to go back! Review #57:the hotel is well located next to Borgese Villa park, and 5-minute cab drive to the city center (Paizza del Spagna and Piazza del Popolo). The hotel has a free shuttle that leaves every 30 minutes, which is an excellent arrangement. i had two connecting rooms which are good for the family. Rooms are clean, traditional in style, cleaned well. Molton Brown toiletries. The staff is friendly and speaks English. You will find most of the TV channels at most world languages. Breakfasts are superb. One thing to look out for is air conditioning which is switched off in late autumn. make sure you ask for the room that faces the courtyard, otherwise you will find it noisy with having to open your windows. Review #58:What we sought was simply a home base in Rome while we overcame jet lag and prepared for a two-week Italian auto tour. We were neither pleasantly surprised, nor disappointed, finding a moderately priced small room, professional staff and a delightful pool scene smack in the middle of Rome's Central Park West! The best and most expensive rooms are on the inside, facing the pool, while we stayed on the ground floor facing a busy street . But if you are going to splurge, do so at the new Lungarno Portrait Suites hotel, which we admired on a brief look-see. On the plus side, this hotel is directly across from the Borghese Gardens (which will prove a sublime treat to all who go there for a morning jog) and the short walk to the car rental outlet best situated for leaving this hectic city, the Borghese Gardens garage or the Parioli Hertz location on via Bruno Buozzi. Review #59:All aspects of our stay at the Aldrovandi were excellent - from the elegant and spacious rooms, the helpful and accommodating staff to the delicious breakfast. The location on the Borghese Gardens means that the setting is peaceful yet still only a short drive from the centre of Rome - or a leisurely walk through the park. Well worth a return visit. Review #60:My husband and I spent an enjoyable week at the Aldrovandi Villa in mid October. The hotel was very lovely, the staff gracious and our suite spacious. The room was cleaned thoroughly during the day and freshened in the evening. The bathroom was large with double sinks, Molton Brown toiletries and a fine bath/shower combination. All staff, including the front desk, concierge, bar, restaurant and the shuttle driver was accommodating. The hotel is by the Borghese gardens and museum and hence is in a quiet location. Review #61:I selected this Hotel because of its proximity to the Galleria Borghese and the Galleria Nationale d'Arte Moderne e Contemporanea. On the plus side it is close to the wonderful, peaceful parklands. It is ,however, one of the noisiest hotels I have ever had the misfortune to stay in. Despite my requesting a quiet room some weeks in advance, when I arrived I was told there were none left. They offered to move me to a quieter room the next night. This did not happen. I spent three nights listening to continual traffic. When I complained I was told that they could do nothing! This Hotel should be honest about the noise levels. Unless you go to bed in a drunken stupour you will find this a noisy hotel. The rooms were obviously decorated 20 years ago and are in need of a make over. The showers are hand held and weak. Don't rely on the hairdryer, it would be quicker drying your hair out the window. The Hotel has a wonderful pool and outdoor area, away from the street. The food is expensive 16 Euros for a plate of broth! It has a strangely named restaurant called \" Baby\", which produces good food at a price and a grill room that offers expensive snacks/drinks. One can take a leisurely stroll through the wonderful parklands nearby to Via Veneto. There are some wonderful Restaurants off Via Veneto. I would recommend Papa Baccus Restorante in Via Toscania. Despite the interesting English spellings on the menu the food is excellent. This street is behind the Marriott. The Aldrovandi Palace is a a noisy faded beauty manned by bemused staff. Unless you like to sleep on the street, I would give this place a miss! Review #62:We went to Rome, my husband and I last July 2010. We ended up at the Aldrovandi Villa Borghese which is a Leading Hotels of the World, at the beginning I was a bit concerned about my choice it was our anniversary and I really wanted to surprise my husband and make him feel better cause he is working a lot. I really did not expect all the attention they gave us during our stay. As soon as we entered in the room (very nice room, large with nice view and lots of natural light) we found a nice bottle of champagne with bon bons and a greeting from the director of the hotel. The all experience was very good I am defently going back for my birthday I am sure they won\u2019t miss it. Review #63:Pros: Absolutely gorgeous, top-notch breakfast buffet (included in some packages), beautiful rooms, and service is the best we've ever enjoyed. Concierge Guiseppe is THE BEST- professional but warm, helpful in making complex arrangements to simple advice. All staff we encountered was warm, helpful and English-speaking. They knew it was our 20th anniversary, and champagned and desserts were waiting for us when we arrived as well as an upgraded room. Con: only one- not the most convenient location, as it is beyond the city walls to the north. You are near the Borghese Museum. Villa Borghese, and National Museum- and an easy walk to Via Veneto for excellent dining and shopping- but a long walk from many top sites. The hotel runs a free shuttle to Spanish Steps every 20 minutes, however, which really helps. Highly recommend the nightlife around Spanish steps and Trevi fountain- always buzzing with people and activity! Review #64:The hotel is elegant and beautiful, apart from the awkward manekins that greet you in the lobby. The pool/garden area is lovely but you can't sit out during the evening unless you're eating at Baby restaurant and the inside lounge is rather gloomy. The food options are very limited if you're not eating at Baby. The alternative 'Grill' restaurant only serves snacks and salads and strangely nothing 'grilled'. Breakfast is very good but a bit chaotic. The shuttle bus service to the spanish steps would be handy if it wasn't booked up in advance for the times you're likely to want to use it. I enjoyed my stay overall but will rather stay somehwere else with outside space that you can hang out in in the evening and more relaxed dining options. Review #65:Fabulous hotel! Great break from the hustle and bustle of Rome. Pool is long enough to swim laps in, and empties out around 6:30p before it closes. Gym is sufficient and empty for a quick work out. Room service and breakfast are way overpriced. Staff is attentive, especially housekeeping, concierge and valet. Concierge found great restaurants. Bathrooms are beautiful. Great place for children. Right across the street from the park with the zoo. Shuttle runs back and forth to Spanish Steps every 15 minutes. Get Bruno with the Eternal City tours and you will be set! Review #66:Great expectations from the website, a booking for a garden view plus honeymooner status... poor quality shabby 1970s room that felt like it was stuck up in the attic, no view of garden or pool unless you craned your neck. Incomplete TV reception on an enormous vintage set, no wifi (had to go to outdated business centre and then asked to pay...which seems so tight given price of rooms) only mens magazines on side table, awful complimentary shampoo etc (not even conditioner)....in fact a no sense of luxury at all. We asked to swap rooms which they reluctantly did after an hour's wait - a junior suite instead, facing the road which was fine and more modern. Large empty lobby, no papers, no real local information (surprising given it's next to the most fabulous garden with Villa etc nearby), gym was really unappealing and out of date. The only great thing was the pool which was wonderful. We did not try Baby restaurant as it looked so empty! DIsappointing really, but thankfully Rome is brilliant. Review #67:The location is very nice in a quiet corner of the villa borghese surrounded by embassies. The hotel was very nice. The rooms were small but air conditioned and more than comfortable. They tout their car service to the Spanish steps but service was erratic and often full. Breakfast good, not great. There was a beautiful pool but alas we were too busy touring Review #68:An outdoor pool is a must in Rome when the temperature reaches nearly 40 degrees at this time of year. The Rooms are air conditioned and the breakfast is fantastic! A good all round hotel which is conveniently situated for the Centre. The only negatives I would give is the Service was a bit slow during the day for drinks etc The evening service in the \"Baby\" restaurant is totally different, it seemed totally seperate from the hotel. All the staff in the hotel were friendly and polite. Review #69:We stayed four nights at the Aldrovandi Palace. The first inconvenience was that Booking had not sent our reservation to the hotel. Luckily, a room was available. The hotel was nice, the service very good, the shuttle to Piazza Spagna very convenient. The only regret was the price of the Internet connection: 22 euros per day. Of course you also had the opportunity to use it by hour at the price of 10 euros/hour!!! We will not stay again in a hotel that charged that much for Internet. Review #70:Stayed here for business, had a wonderful spacious and comfortable room overlooking an elegant residential neighbourhood with embassies. free shuttle bus to Spanish steps every 30 minutes, it takes 5 minutes to get there. Great for joggers, the parc is just across the street. Large fitness center for rainy days. I loved the breakfast buffet with lots of fruit and different joghurts and home made pastries. Bed very comfy and Molton Brown amenities in the bathroom with maxi shower stall. Front desk staff very helpful and efficient, not so stuffy as in some of the old palaces in the centre. Will be back Rolf MB, Paris Review #71:Excellent stay with very helpful staff. Request a room overlooking the garden / pool and facing the inside area. Ground floor might be a bit close to the road. Staff very helpful and an excellent Michelin star restaurant which is surprising good value (for Rome). Very pleasant stay and would definitely return. But its not cheap..... Review #72:We booked this hotel as a way to reward ourselves at the end of our trip and it was worth every penny. It is among the most expensive places we have stayed at but it is worth every penny. Starting off the location is stunning. It is surrounded by beautiful gardens and is well away from the crowd. They have a shuttle that takes you right to the spanish steps so you spend nothing on taxis. We were lucky enough to be upgraded and the rooms are beautiful. They are white, with large bathrooms and a huge bed. There is a television in the bathroom thats embedded in the mirror. That in itself was worth the money! Food is fantastic and the hotel hosts one of the finest restaurants in Rome - Baby. The concierge desk does what its meant to and advises you on everything and books all your trips especially that all important visit to St Peter's Basilica. They also gave us fantastic recommendations for Dinner. This is our hotel for Rome and we will always go back here. Review #73:I cannot fault this hotel, its a twenty minute walk through beutaiful gardens to the sapnsih steps and far enough away to escape the city by the pool. I never want internet acces when i`m away but can see how that is strange for some people BUT this is not a modern hotel so expect old class elegance. It was my and my new new husbands first visit to Rome and our honeymoon, and I have to say from the moment the car and driver met us at the airport our stay was magnificent. All the staff especially the delightful concierge where incredibly helpful and amazed me at even supply a bottle of champagne! We could not fault your hotel and especially the staff who I think make the hotel so special. We will definitely be recommending your hotel to anyone who will listen and we will definitely be coming again, maybe for our anniversary ! Many Thanks again for making our honeymoon. Sue Andrews (Mrs) Review #74:We visited Rome for the first time and friends told us to look for a nice hotel as a bad hotel can spoil your trip to this beautiful city. As we expected the weather to be very hot we based our search for a hotel on an outdoor swimming pool. And the pool held what it promised, very refreshing surrounded by a beautiful garden. We booked a pool view room, which is essential as there is a tram passing the front of the hotel! The location is not perfect but the shuttle service is excellent. A taxi will cost you between 10 and 20 Euros from the centre of Rome. The service was excellent, and the hotel itself just beautiful. A little tip, by pure luck we got to a restaurant on top of one of the hills of Rome called \"The View\", not only fantastic food, but as it says in the name, the view over Rome was fantastic. That you have to try the hotel's own restaurant \"Baby\" goes without saying- oh Baby! Review #75:fast, friendly service from checkin to checkout. Upgrades granted almost always with breakfast staff friendly and courteous. Never noisy. Have a cappuccino ! Villa Borghese right across the street and a 15 minute walk to the top of Via Veneto. Excellent value if you book a couple of weeks ahead. Review #76:My husband and baby daughter stayed here in August and on 1st appearances the hotel was very grand and staff were extremely helpful. Our room was of an average hotel size but it was very dark and quite dingy. The bathroom again was small and of average standard. The TV only had one channel (BBC News24) in english and any childrens channels were 19E each. The pool area was lovely and a very relaxing place to be and the pool attendants and restuarant staff very attentive. There wasn't however enough space around the pool when the hotel was full and fighting for sunbeds actually in the sun became a daily battle. The pool was nice and clean but freezing. We chose this hotel because it had 2 restuarants to eat in and we would have to stay in most evenings because of our baby daughter (babysitting was an option but we only booked twice as it was 20E an hour). The mitchellin starred resturant was nice but very overpriced in my opinion and the 'grill' restuarant grilled nothing! All you could eat there was salads, even in the evening. The menues were very poor throughout the hotel and choice was very limited. Breakfast was disappointing again and again very overpriced at 20E a head. In summary the whole hotel was overpriced and very tired looking. Fantastic shuttle bus I wouldn't stay there again - unless they reduced their star rating and prices. Review #77:The hotel is situated 5min walk of the national gallery and the villa borghese park. The hotel offers free rides from the hotel to the Spanish steps every 30min. from early in the morning and comming back( the last bus leaves at 10.45pm.) One thing, make shure that you reserve a seat for this bus because it is small. The pesonel is very friendly and helpful. The restaurant situated in the hotel is nice but expensive, a glass of chardonnay was suggested (25,- euro's per glass). The diner was nice but not sooo nice.. that ofcourse depends on everyones own taste. A glass of coca cola is 9,-. Capuchino 6,-.The beds in the room where hard and I prefer softer beds. The breakfast is very good! The pool and garden is fantastic. Review #78:The Aldrovandi Palace Hotel owes this favorable review as much or more to the location and other amenites, as opposed to the hotel facility itself. Located in the \"green lung\" of Rome behind the Borghese Gardens, the location even in the heat of summer felt resort like and offered a relatively quiet environment. The hotel pool is cool and refreshing and the outdoor cafe is a wonderful place to have lunch. Sandro, the cafe manager, was one of the best hosts we have encountered on our travels throughout the world. Were the front desk as committed to customer service as much as Sandro is, the overall experience would have been superb, but it was not. We were, however, able to overcome our annoyance on arriving from New Jersey to find our room not ready though it had been requested. Also ignored was our request to have an upper level floor in the back and away from the sounds of streetcars in the front of the hotel. We were moved, but the request from our travel agent for an early check-in and back room had been totally ignored until our arrival. Based on the location, pool and outdoor cafe, we would return to the Aldrovandi Palace Hotel without a hesitation in summer time. We can't imagine a more pleasant environment in a big city at that time of year. We might consider other properties in non summer months, however, as the room itself was very ordinary, the front desk concierge service flawed (in its accuracy on certain tourist information and overall helpfulness) , and though we reported our tub/shower leaking on 3 occasions, it had not been fixed by the time we left and we were there for 3 days prior to going on to Sardinia. So any readers of this review would need to look at it from a seasonal perspective with a high rating given for a summer accomodation and a more questionable rating at other times of the year. Review #79:We are regular traveller all round the world, but this hotel is really something special. To start with - it is located in real oasis in Rome - Villa Borghese, where you can escape from crowds and noises of this wonderful city. Air around the hotel is very fresh and clear. At the same time you are 5-10 minutes from everywhere of interest. Hotel has got excellent shuttle service to Spanish Steps. Front desk staff were unbelievably supportive, friendly and carefull to every your need. It was our first time in Rome and Concierges - Giuseppe and Mario - made our acquaintance with Rome very pleasant and efficient. Apart from this restaurants, beauty salons, they directed us to, were really fantastic. In Aldrovandi they have now their prominent restaurant with Michelin chief-cook. This made this hotel even more attractive to us. The barman made for us tailor-made cocktails with proportions which we prefered. Rooms are spacy and cousy and very clean. In summer there is open swimming pool in the hotel's garden. We could write more and more, but to cut this nice story short - I think Aldrovandi Villa Borgese is unique place, which concentrates in it only positive air, style and emotions. We can not wait we will be back! Jonathan Jones and Janna Kochkina Review #80:Hotel very traditional and quiet. Most staff (especially restaurant) were extremely helpful and professional. Having booked a specific room not overlooking the road was somewhat disappointed to be allocated one during a three night break away from our three young children. First night spent wide awake with traffic noise and faulty air conditioner - to justify the room rates attention needs to be paid to the sound proofing of rooms. Consequently we moved room after first night (as did several other guests) which was an inconvenience we could have done without. During the move a soft cuddly toy was left behind between rooms which we realised on our way home - whilst it was not expensive it was for our seven year old daughter and I do not understand why Housekeeping did not find it as it was clearly new in a Harrods bag - on enquiring at the hotel it was apparent from the tone of the staff at that time that they did not really want to go into any great depth to find it. When asked if they would ask the Maid when Housekeeping came back negatively they were defensive. Not what I expect from a Leading Hotel of the World - we have stayed in many far more luxurious accommodations. Rome really needs a Four Seasons to knock service into the 22nd Century. No water at turndown time is really not acceptable in this day and age. Baggage taking an age to be located, arrogance from front desk. Overall a nice break but certainly not \"historic\". Review #81:The stay was expensive and hotel rated high so I expected to get value for money. BUT, the hotel is very old fashioned and room needed a face lift. When we went to the room and put the air conditioning on, it made terrible smell to the room as it was not cleaned or used for a while. Room had a carpet floor, which created untidy impression. Quite busy street was right under our window which made the stay a bit noisy. Location is not the most convenient to see the major sights - on the other hand Borghese park right next to the hotel is good for jogging and relaxing. Breakfast was luxorious. I felt it was bad service that we did not get iron and ironboard to the room even though we requested but were forced to utilize the expensive ironing services from hotel. I'm type of person who wants to do it myself. All in all, maybe some old fashioned people like this hotel but not for me. Review #82:We absolutely loved our stay at Aldrovandi Villa Borghese. The receptionist was lovely and helpful. The room (delux room) was spacious, luxurious and practical. The housekeeper tidied the room twice a day. A great and surprising touch with tv integrated in the mirror in the bathroom. Loved the Molton Brown toiletries. Breakfast had a nice and well-assorted selection. Nothing extravagant but all you need. Very friendly and attentive waiters. Outdoors pool was a perfect cool-down in the warm summer weather in Rome. Distance to Rome city centre is a 15 min walk through a lovely park. The shuttle service is also a practical and easy alternative. Just remember to book ahead for the last runs at night. Be also aware that prices in mini-bar and restaurant are very high. Bottle of water in minibar comes at 8 euros! Review #83:Well apart from being quite a way out of town (a good 20 minute walk through the park), there were a number of little things that let the place down. we paid for a superior room ... and the first night, it certainly wasn't what we received (small room with barely enough room to move around the bed). With the trams rolling past all night, you want to make sure you get a room at the back. The last two nights were certainly a different cup of tea in terms of size space and quietness. But there were also a string of little things that annoy - from an Internet service that takes more trouble than it should to administer (quite slow too). To the lack of service or any sort of response on a Sunday morning by the pool. The breakfast was excellent, but only having the choice of an eye-watering expensive restaurant (but good), is not really good enough. There really is nothing around this hotel apart from the park opposite (nice) - but at least a 10-15 minute walk to find an espresso, and similarly in the other direction for the only restaurant in the neighbourhood. Otherwise you are into a shuttle to the Spanish Steps every half hour (often booked up). Overall, the decor was 1970's trying to be old ... just doesn't cut it any more. For the money, I would choose other options. Review #84:For a reputable 5* Hotel in Rome, we were very dissapointed with this hotel. The rooms were poorly decorated, staff below average and overall service quite poor. It was one of five 5* hotels we stayed on our honeymoon. Honestly, we will never stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it to our friends. Review #85:hotel staff are brilliant-couldn't fault them in particular Eva, most helpful. Our room was clean and the turn down service with chocolates lovely. Our breakfast were the main bone of contention, for a michelin star restaurant on the premises what happened in the morning? Had they employed a cleaner to whip up cold eggs, even colder cups of cappucino, and as for the rest of the \"hot food\"..... how they can get everything else so right beggars belief. The breakfast was like this everyday the only redeeming feature was the free paper, but how can youenjoy that when sipping tepid salty tea? Location ideal to get away from the hustleand bustle, and the free shuttle to town is very handy. Review #86:The Aldrovandi is is beautiful luxury hotel in Rome. However my husband and I found the location somewhat out of the way. The walk through the Villa Borghese gardens were lovely in the mornings but the climb up the hill, through the gardens and up the hill to the hotel could get quite tiresome after a long day of sightseeing. However, the pool and garden areas were a wonderful retreat from the hustle and bustle of this magnificent city. I can truly say that I fell in love with the City of Rome. As did my husband. We have been fortunate to travel to a number of locations and this is one of a few we would truly love to go back too and spend more time. The history is amazing, the people friendly, the food and the wine, what can one say. We enjoy walking the environs of cities we visit and the main core of Rome (Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, Piazza de Popolo, Capitoline Hill, etc) are all delightful walks. Being an ancient city you often turn corners and discover something quite unexpected. Review #87:We arrived in the hotel and greated with a cold smile . We were shown to our rooms through a smelly corridor Thankfully the room did not smell as bad. Rooms basic WARNING when taking a taxi to the airport BEWARE as our taxi arrived to the hotel with 9 euros on the meter and went into the hotel to get change I reminded him the meter was running and he said it will only be euro on the meter.He then handed the porter some money 1 or 2 \u20ac5 euro notes .We got to the airport the meter read \u20ac79.80 when it should be less then \u20ac55 as the hotel concierge advised.This would lead me to belive there is a scam going on in a hotel you would not expect . Daniel the shuttle bus driver is very helpful. A bottle of heiniken is \u20ac11 at the bar espresso \u20ac9 Review #88:From arriving at the hotel on Thursday last week, we were greeted by the most friendly, polite staff. We were given a brief guide to the hotel facilities, then shown to our room with a beautifull view of the pretty courtyard style gardens and pool area. The room was clean, bright and airy, and the bathroom clean, modern with bath and shower. The hotel is about a 10 minutes drive to the Spanish Steps, but the hotel provides a courtesy people carrier on the hour between 10am and 7pm then picks up at 25 past the hour - you need to pre-book this each day, but we were never refused. Our normal driver, Daniel, was a credit to the hotel as he answered every question, and even detoured one day to drop us closer to Vatican City. The hotel has a lovely lobby area with a bar which was comfortable, quiet and well serviced. Breakfast at 33 euros per head was overly expensive for what it was (especially as we only had a coffeee and a croissant) On the saturday night, which was my wife's 40th birthday, we dined at Baby. We have dined at many top restaurants in london, but nothing compared to our experience here. We opted for the taster menu, of 7 courses including scorpion fish, beef, pasta, wild mushrooms - I can not begin to describe the taste and quality. It was fairly expensive at about 180 euro's including a bottle of wine - but worth it - especially when the waiter brought out a birthday cake for my wife - totally unexpected!! The waiters were very attentive, and the decor very contemporary/minmalist. Overall, a fantastic experience that i would recommend to everyone - and one that my wife and i will not forget - thankyou. Review #89:I stayed at this hotel on valantines weekend (fed 08) with my girlfriend. The hotel is very nice inside, and the staff are very pleasant/helpfull. The rooms are very tidy, and the complimenty turn down service at night leaves you with slippers next to your bed and chocalates. The hotel room is equipped with complimenty bathrobes, slippers, shompoo's etc, bowl of fruit, and a bottle of water. The bathromm is very big, huge bath, and lovely. Things to note: Whilst we stayed there, there are renovation works in the lobby, this is not noisy at all, and you will harley notice it. The hotel is very expensive inside, the resturant Babys is 300Euro per head, so i would not eat in the hotel. The hotel provide a free taxi to the spanish steps (central location) on every hour 10am-7pm mon-sat. This is great. The hotel is not right in the centre and it is 7euro into the centre of rome, 10euro to the vatican. I would reccomend you use the shuttle bus, they drop you off an dpick you up at 25past each hour. One in the city, you must walk rome, as you get to see a lot more. The hotel will provide you with a map. As for noise, the renovations are very quiet. We stayed in a room next to the road, and it was not noisy at all. Last thing, bring a travel iron, the hotel room will not provide you with an iron, they charge 15euro for an ironing service, and you must give the item in bye 10am that day. Overall, the hotel is lovely and i would reccoment it to everyone. The bad reviews must be very moany people, as the hotel is wonderful. Thanks Review #90:We visited Rome over the New Year\u2019s Holiday to celebrate the arrival of 2012 in the Eternal City. We were extremely pleased with our stay at this hotel. The location inside Villa Borghese added to the magic of the location and was breathtaking. Upon arrival to the hotel we were greeted by beautifully decorated and manicured trees sparkling with white lights and red d\u00e9cor. Inside we were greeted by a lovely young woman that assisted with our check in and then escorted us to our room. She provided an informative tour along the way. We found the lobby bar to be attentive and offered a vast selection. Aside from some Wi-Fi issues at the front desk, we had a most pleasant stay. Wi-Fi in the guests rooms worked without issues. The hotel does provide a van to the Spanish Steps which also provides access to Rome\u2019s most fashionable shopping. Following our visit, we talked with management about one concern and it was rectified immediately. I can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about the magnificence of this hotel. We travel all over the world and will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and can\u2019t wait to return in the near future. Review #91:Lovely building with classic decoration, a lot of wood panelling and an elegant atmosphere that reminded me of the Quisisana on Capri. The hotel smells of amber, like the Plaza Athenee in Paris, another of my favourites. The rooms are comfortable but a little dated, especially some of the bathrooms. The attention to detail, especially the housekeeping, is among the best I have ever seen (reminded me of the Ritz in London). Great bar and very good grill restaurant in a room next to the bar decorated like a traditional English club. Breakfast is served in the gorgeous Sala Verde with a veranda overlooking the garden. The buffet is well presented but is fairly standard and not at all up to the level of the Michelin-starred restaurant. Lovely garden with pool and terrace cafe. Large fitness room but some of the Technogym equipment is out of date. Great service from all the staff, but a special mention for the waiting staff at the bar and the grill restaurant. The location is good if you want to be away from the crowds of central Rome in the summer. It is across the street from the Borghese Gardens and close to the Villa Giulia and a few other museums. The hotel has a shuttle to the Spanish Steps, but I would hesitate to use the Aldrovandi as a base for a first trip to Rome. Review #92:The Aldrovandi Palace is located across the street form the Borghese gardens. The beautiful neighborhood is full of fantastic villas. This is a great place to retreat to after a day of heavy sightseeing. The pool and gardens are wonderful. Try to get a room overseeing them. Although some reviews complained about expensive wi-fi, I was given 24 hours free and offered free use of an I Pad for 2 hours at a time, so there is no need to pay for wi fi. Most plans include breakfast. The restaurant on site (Oliver Glower) is excellent from a chef with 2 Michelin stars at his place in Capri. Transportation into the heart of the city is easy: walk a half mile to either the Flaminia or Espana metro stops, take the hotel shuttle, or it is an inexpensive cab ride. The staff could not have been more helpful. Highly recommend. Review #93:The hotel is close by the Villa Borghese park, and has a shuttle car every 30 min that l bring you to the Spanish steps. This is also the pick up point when going back to the hotel. The rooms are spacious. We ordered an airport transfer from the hotel which was charged with 100 euros. The taxi back to the airport came on 50 euros. This combination suited us best. We received an upgrade on the room, which was spacious and delicate. The staff were very helpful and knowledgable. The breakfast was ok. Had however expected more from this hotel - no vegetables, and the musli was crumbled cookies, but the breakfast room was beautiful. Walking distance to the Museum of Modern Art and the Villa Borghese museum. If you like jogging, bring your gear, because the park is perfect for that. Perfect hotel in Rome, and would definitely come back. Review #94:What a find this hotel was. Whilst quite expensive it was worth every penny, the staff were excellent and the concierge was especially helpful. Our friend\u2019s room was not quite as modern as ours but still good. The pool area was absolutely super which we used late afternoon having spent most of the day exploring Rome. The courtesy car to the Spanish Steps was also good and was quite prepared to drop you at points on the way to the Steps. Review #95:We absolutely adored this grand hotel and particularly its key location, ideal for those who appreciate and love to enjoy the hectic rhythms of the \u2018eternal city\u2019 but at the same time love to have the privilege of a special retreat where privacy is guaranteed. Just few steps from Villa Borghese gardens this hotel offers the unique opportunity to enjoy jogging or simply a walk down to the Spanish Steps\u2026where the complimentary hotel shuttle bus is ready for you to even pick you up at the end of a tiring shopping day take you back to the hotel: how fabulous! Spacious and elegant rooms and professional staff complete this magnificent frame! Review #96:We stayed at the Aldrovandi Palace to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary and it was simply perfect. The hotel is spotless. the rooms are spacious and beautifully maintained. It was fantastic having a swimming pool after a hot day sightseeing and the service around this area was first class. The shuttle service to the Spanish steps was reliable and it was a pleasure to eat out each evening under the moonlight. All the staff were friendly, professional and efficient. We are planning our next trip already. Review #97:This is a lovely hotel about 25 minute walk to the Spanish steps. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Gorgeous bathroom although I felt the decor was slightly dated in the room. Lovely breakfast (continental and cooked) but it's a bit expensive if not included in the price - 33 euros! Drinks were also a little pricey in the lounge bar, 9 euros for a small beer. One small quibble, we asked for an iron and were told laundry could only be sent away, it cost 20 euros to have a dress pressed, so pack your travel iron! Very nice pool area with attentive service. A lovely stay in Rome away from the hustle and bustle. Review #98:We booked a weekend in Rome in April and decided to push the boat out and book a room at the Aldovandi Palace having been so taken in by their website. Be warned, if you book a standard room do not be fooled by the photos and expect a similar standard. The room we were given was on the ground floor, was tiny, tired and had a very 70s looking mirrored wall. We both felt very upset and so I went straight back to the reception and spoke to the manager. To their credit they immediately showed me a deluxe room and upgraded us free of charge. This room was a little more like the sumptuous settings as portrayed on their website. The air conditioning, however, did not work and so we slept with the window open all night which kept us largely awake with the constant trafic and trams. On a plus, the breakfasts were the best we have ever had in a hotel. The choice was enormous and very delicious. This hotel Im sure was once one of the leading small hotels of the world. However, it now has a very dated and tired feel throughout and probably not worth the rates they charge. Review #99:Overall i thought the hotel was excellent.The staff were very professional.The only downside was the bed.It was rock hard,as was my brother in laws bed. We were told that they were all like it. Also, the only way of cooling the room was to keep the window open as the Air Con was turned off at this time of year. This resulted in a dozen or so insect bites. My family had not told the Hotel that it was my birthday, but i did arrive in my room that evening to find a bottle of Sparkling on ice. A very nice touch. All in all it was a very nice experience. just a shame about the bed and the temperature.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Our previous stay at the Wedgewood - just prior to them being awarded a rating as a place to stay by Conde Naste - was tremendous. Unfortunately the hotel seems to have lost its star status- or at least that was our experience. The lobby and the room were needing some care and attention. Obviously the hotel has recognized this as the major problem we experienced was due to renovation. Construction and painting were going on in the room next to ours. A strong smell of paint persisted in our room throughout our four day stay - even over a weekend. When a complaint was made after the first night the staff sent up a machine intended to clean the air, we were told not to be in the room while it was on. We needed to keep the window open when we were in the room resulting in a cold stay. Vancouver was not warm in February. We were not provided with an option of moving rooms - despite this being a four day stay. In addition there was noise throughout the day so a little nap in the afternoon during the holiday was out of the question. Guests should be advised that construction is taking place prior to booking. The prices of the Wedgewood have risen over the years as the hotel has been discovered. Our experience in 2006 does not support the reputation that the hotel now enjoys. Perhaps the renovations will help to keep the hotel at the top but in the meantime guests should be informed that the construction may impact on their comfort and enjoyment. Review #1:My husband and I were sadly disappointed in this hotel, after I read rave reviews about how fantastic this hotel was and there is none like it in B.C. I planned this trip for our fifth year anniversary and wanted to be pampered. The spa was excellent, but I truly could not understand how this hotel could be rated above 3-star. We paid for a suite, which was over $350/US nightly, so, we expected five star service, food and accommodations. The service was lack luster, the room was very clean but definitely not fancy. The food, which for dinner we paid over $100 to eat in our room, not including drinks, was so-so. One great aspect which stood out in my mind, was the housekeeping supervisor. Our bed was awful so when we called the following day, she switched out our bed with the only pillow top in the hotel. We were thankful for her consideration, but decided to cut our trip short. We left two days earlier than scheduled and ended up spending our last two days at our favorite hotel, Bellevue Club in Bellevue, WA. We spent half the money we did in Bellevue and received two times the service, food quality and comfortable night stay. If you are used to four+ star hotels, you may want to continue looking before plunking down the four-star money here! Review #2:Comfy and quiet. The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. I think this is the first time I've been to a hotel and couldn't find ANYTHING to complain about. Everything worked! and everything was nice and clean. The complimentary chocolates and cookies were a very nice touch and a BIG bathtub for two, not in the bathroom, but IN the room itself. The hotel restaurant, Bacchus, had delicious food and good staff. Can't say enough good about this hotel. Review #3:The Wedgewood is our hotel of choice whenever we come to Vancouver. The location is great - a five minute walk (or less) to Pacific Centre, Robson street, the Art Gallery and great restaurants. It is a gem in a busy city - always a pleasure to return to after a busy day of shopping and sightseeing. The lounge is fantastic - intimate and urban, with really good food and drink. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean. Extra touches, such as free bottled water and cookies are appreciated. The service is consistently good at the Wedgewood. Mark, who checked us in on this last visit, was great - friendly and attentive. He recommended a great restaurant to us (Coast). We look forward to our next stay at this wonderful hotel. Review #4:My family stayed at the Wedgewood in June, on the way to and from an Alaskan cruise. The hotel was beautiful and charming, and we really enjoyed our stay. We had an adjoining room for the kids- they slept on the pull-out couch. We did request an extra cot since the kids are teenagers and didn't relish sharing a bed, but there were not any cots or roll-away beds. The kids especially loved the turn down service with the cookies. The location of the hotel is excellent, we were able to access many activities easily. We had one breakfast and one dinner at the hotel's restaurant. The food was very good, presented well and the price was expensive but fair. We thought the decor of the room was very nice, comfortable and inviting. The front desk staff was generally great- although there was one woman that was exceptionally helpful, going out of her way to help us with all of our requests (even one request of finding a store to get a broken watch repaired was fulfilled within minutes). There was another woman that worked at the front desk who was a bit aloof and stern, but was professional. We would definitely stay here again if we visit this beautiful city in the future. Review #5:After reading many of the reviews for this hotel and others in Vancouver we decided to stay at the Wedgewood. It seemed that hands down it received the best over all reviews. Years ago we had stayed at Sutton Place and really liked it, but the reviews lead us to believe that it was not as nice as it was in the late 80's and 90's. I had gone on line to look at the rooms at the Wedgewood and did think they looked a little \"tired\" but decided to stay there anyway because we like small hotels and booked a junior suite. Needless to say, we were very disappointed with the tired, outdated rooms and bathroom. There were no towel racks to hang the towels on in the small bathroom and the cheap oversized plastic waste paper basket was wedged between the toilet and the toilet paper holder. The tv in the bedroom was situated high in the corner of the bedroom on the type of platform you would find in a hospital room. And the room safe was from another era altogether. Also when we were checking out of our room we dediced not to call the bellman as our two bags were on wheels. However we forgot that there are stairs leading down to reception from the eleavators (why they don't have a ramp, especially for a handicap person, makes no sense) and as we were going down the stairs (with a bellman just standing there) my husband's bag ended up falling down the stairs, breaking the handle. The hotel was clean and the bed comfortable, and I think that with a major renovation this could be a lovely hotel, but I know I will not stay there again in it's present condition. Review #6:We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Wedgewood. The staff were extremely friendly, courteous and professional - nothing was too much trouble. Our room was fabulous - wonderful big bed, amazing bath, and a lovely balcony with great views out over the city. A highlight was an amazing English Afternoon tea which was better than any I've had at the Ritz in London. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Vancouver. Review #7:Our room was beautiful and the housekeeping service was impeccable but I have to say I was not impressed with the rest of the staff and for this reason I will probably not stay there again. I would expect the staff of a hotel of this caliber to provide excellent customer service and I agree with another reviewer that the front of house staff seemed young and not polished. When we arrived by Taxi we carried our bags into the hotel while the kid working the valet stayed at his stand. Not once during our stay did the gentlemen working the valet open the door for us and greet us. All we received was a smile as they continued to talk to each other about there personal lives. The front desk/concierge staff were cordial but did not go out of there way to make us feel welcome. In contrast when we went to the Wickaninnish Inn in Torfino they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. When we arrived they met our taxi offloaded our luggage and brought it to the check in desk. The person who cehcked us in then escorted us to our room and informed us about the particulars of our room, the hotel, and the area. Every time we would leave or arrive they would open the door and would ask us how our day was and if there is anything we needed. When we would ask the concierge about an activity or restaurant she would offer to book a reservation. The morning we left they had coffee waiting for us at check out. That is what I would have expected from the Wedgewood. Review #8:From the moment that we walked in to the Wedgewood it was a fantastic experience. The valet was efficient and we were checked in very speedily. The room was lovely, clean and well furnished. The bathroom was great. No detail was too small, down to the nice toiletries and great quality coffee. In the evening, there was water and cookies and a turn down service. Dinner in Bacchus was a treat, the food was excellent with a relaxed ambience. Our stay included the continental breakfast which was nice. Looks like they have a pretty good gym and the spa looks lovely. The location is great and near to the heart of Vancouver with all its attractions and good shopping. The courtesy, professionalism and warmth exuded by all the staff was exemplary...loved the total attention to detail. Will certainly be coming back again...very, very highly recommended. Congratulations to the staff at the Wedgewood...awesome! Review #9:Picked the Wedgewood Hotel for a short Vancouver vacation based on reviews here as well as Yelp.com. The Wedgewood is a smaller boutique hotel nestled among some stiff competition. The location is very central to Vancouver, once you get your bearings it's very doable to walk most places. Our room was on the 12th floor with a larger than you might expect veranda. The veranda had several large potted plants, round glass table and 4 chairs. A nice place to have a coffee in the AM or a cocktail in the afternoon. The bed was comfortable, room was equipped with a flat screen TV, and wifi is provided. Room as well as the rest of the hotel are tastefully decorated. Evening turn down included two fresh cookies every evening. The highlight of the Wedgewood was the staff. Every single staff member we encountered was friendly and very helpful. This type of service really set the Wedgewood apart from the majority of hotels we've stayed in (at this price point). If you stay here you won't be disappointed. Review #10:We chose to stay here for our first few nights in Canada on our honeymoon. We could not have picked a better place. The service was incredible. Everyone is so friendly. My husband bought a baseball bat and ball and was even offered a game- it totally won him over!! The rooms were large, comfy and very clean. We had a large balcony and enjoyed looking down on the bustling street. We loved this place so much we came back two more times during our road trip!!! I would absolutely stay here again. Review #11:We stayed at this delightful hotel for 3 nights in September, 2006 just before boarding our cruise ship. It is in a wonderful position, close to all the shops and we were given a lovely front room. We had a weekend package with bed and breakfast which we felt was good value. The only downside was that we ate in their Bacchus Restaurant one night and we felt the meal was rushed. We were out within 45 minutes which to us was far too rapid. We do like to linger over a meal especially when we are paying top dollar. That is our only criticism of a great hotel. Review #12:Visiting family in Vancouver this year we decided to spend a few nights at the Wedgewood....what a delight! This hotel came highly recommended and we were not disappointed very friendly staff who always had a smile, lively bar & restaurant and just lovely rooms. We did not get a room overlooking Robson Square but it didn't matter this place is all about quality, bed linens, marble showers, soaker tubs, furniture and the most comfortable beds. One nice touch is the business center on the second floor, good speed computers are available for guests use at no extra charge, we could stay in touch with our family back in the UK daily without worrying about being charged a fortune. Very well done to everyone at the Wedgewood we will return. Review #13:The Wedgewood Hotel is one of my favourite places to be! When it comes to service, value, atmosphere, professional/friendly staff, large, well equipped rooms, you will not find a better hotel. From the moment you enter the front lobby you can feel the pressures of your day wash away. We always enjoy the service and food quality at The Bacchus lounge and restaurant. (The restaurant is on the higher end but for a special occasion it is the best!) The hotel is very central to all that Vancouver has to offer! Review #14:I stayed at the Wedgewood Hotel for 5 nights in February 2005 with my husband and my baby son. I have stayed in many great hotels before and I must say that the Wedgewood has been one of the best; I would not hesitate to go back. The room was perfect, with all the commodities but with an extra touch (we stayed in one of the Wedgewood Suites - greatly reduced rates in the winter months! ), the service was outstanding (the staff was great with our 18 months old son even though this was clearly not a place where many babies get taken) and the location couldn't be better (right in the middle of all the shops and restaurants in Downtown Vancouver). The little touches we appreciated: being given a private area in the Bacchus restaurant and bar lounge so that we could sip some cocktails while keeping our son with us (children are not admitted in the main bar), the amazing room service (great food from the Bacchus restaurant - the desserts are a pure delight - and the service is faultless), the unexpected baby toiletries in the room, the best blueberry pancakes I've ever tasted and the complementary Belgium chocolates and nightly freshly baked cookies. I did not get to try the spa which I regret and the gym room is a bit small but it does have all the usual required equipment. There is no swimming pool which is a shame but I really don't see where they could fit one anyway. I loved the Bacchus restaurant - for Breakfast, you get to sit in big comfortable armchairs by the fireplace (with a roaring fire in it in the winter!). Although we didn't get to eat there in the evenings because of our son's bedtimes, the restaurant certainly was very popular, always full, with live piano music every night. We had the opportunity to sample the food via Room Service and it was excellent. Review #15:The Wedgewood is a wonderful hotel in every respect. The rooms are lovely. The service is impeccable. The location is great. We arrived at the hotel before check-in time and our room was not ready. The woman at the desk suggested some places of interest nearby, and I asked some questions about some of the attractions we planned to visit during our stay. When we returned to the hotel a few hours later, this woman had taken the initiative during our absence to gather some information about the sights I'd asked about, and print the public transportation routes off the internet. That was a great service touch. Our room was beautiful and well appointed. Staff went out of their way during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. The bar area is wonderful-- a great place to start with breakfast in the morning and end the evening with a nightcap. For those who, like me, prefer an elegant boutique hotel to a sterile chain, the Wedgewood is the perfect spot in Vancouver. Review #16:Stayed at the Wedgewood for 5 nights on our recent holiday and whilst it was the most expensive accomodation of our hols it was well worth the money. As said by others the little touches such as cookies and the chocolates on arrival make the place stick in the memory. Great location just off Robson Street makes everywhere walkable in a city that is a joy to walk around. Also had a meal in the hotel restaraunt \"Bachus\" which was excellent, i'd recommend going for a meal even if your not staying at the hotel, great food in elegant surroundings. All in all a very enjoyable stay in a hotel that has the peresonal touch. On a previous visit we stayed in the Fairmont Waterfront which is another fantastic hotel but i think the Wedgewood pips it for it's little touches as well as it's great rooms. Review #17:My husband and I walked into the Wedgewood after leaving the hotel we had booked (the Opus, which was horrible). We were at the end of a long business travel swing, and wanted somewhere that would work for us both for business and for relaxing. The Wedgewood is definitely quirky--the decor is so dated it's new again (high late-sixties-to-early-seventies), the gym teeny, the bar so retro it's got a piano guy. I had seen pictures of the rooms online, and had my doubts about the in-room tubs. but the rooms were spotless, the service excellent, the location great. prices weren't bad, either. we booked a suite; it's been perfect, comfortable and cozy and spacious and very very very quiet and well-maintained. Staff members are friendly and professional, too. The phone lines are a bit crackly, and there's no ipod docking station (though there are flat-screen tvs) but there's a lot of thoughtfulness and comfort here. Review #18:Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Wedgewood, and was almost sad to leave the hotel. The bed was beautiful, big, and so comfortable. The room and the bathroom were roomy. The toiletries are wonderfully scented. I'd read all about the welcome box of truffles and the nightly cookies and water along with turndown service, but it still felt like a special treat. The location was ideal, truly in the heart of a great and very walk-able downtown. We had a great view from a 10th floor room. I must say that we don't generally stay at places that are this highly rated, so my expectations maybe aren't as high as people who frequently stay at places like this. We got such a GREAT rate as part of their winter discounts, that we almost felt guilty about it :) The staff was personable and very helpful the couple of times we needed directions, or help making reservations (but again we weren't very demanding people). One major thing I noted is that we very rarely heard other guests while in our room. We could hear a door close every now and then, but other than that it felt like we had the entire floor to ourselves. It was a nice surprise because often we feel like a lot of hotels have paper-thin walls. Oh if you stay here, do yourself a favor and book a dinner at the Bacchus restaurant (part of the hotel). It's an expensive restaurant but it is worth every penny. Superb service and even better food. Overall, a great experience and we hope they will run more off-season deals so that we have the opportunity to stay there again. Review #19:My husband and I have just returned from 3 nights at the Wedgewod hotel in Vancouver. It was pure luxury in the executive king suite with balcony. It even had a bar in the room with bar stools. The facilities were exceptional including a giant size soak tub for 2. Comfortable, clean, great service, excellent lounge bar for cocktails and good restaurant. My only comment is that the restaurant is quite formal but do go at least once - the food is excellent. Review #20:Based in the centre of Vancouver with the harbour 7 blocks to the left and the beach 7 blocks to the right of the main entrance. A perfect central location for exploring Vancouver. A very plush hotel. Specious elegant rooms. Excellent service. The staff were very courteous. Review #21:Over the years, I have stayed at the Wedgewood a few times for both business and pleasure. This past November, my husband and I stayed here for a long weekend, and we enjoyed this hotel a fair amount. The location is very good - near the art gallery, shopping, and walking distance (or a short cab ride) to many restaurants. However, we both felt the hotel is in need of some renovation. It's not changed in a decade (at least, possibly longer), and some of the fixtures and decore are dated. Also, our room was near the elevator, despite having asked for a quiet room. This was a disappointment. Still, the service was very good, and our room had a nice view of the park. We enjoyed our time, but would in the future likely choose a hotel that was either built for or updated as a result of the Olympics. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families. I did not use the gym, but my husband did. He said it that calling it a gym is a stretch - more of a work-out bathroom really. Review #22:stayed at the wedgewood for 5 nights and can not praise it enough from check in after a long flight to a very early morning check out everything was great,lovely suite with some nice touches(biscuits and sherry on arrival) homemade cookies and bottled water each night. room service was good and had a great meal in the bacchus restaurant quite pricey but not too expensive for a special treat, location was very central but vancouver is not an enormous city and we found it very walkable.All in all we would go again and be happy to stay at the wedgewood. Review #23:Three girlfriends and I spoiled ourselves with spa services and room service during our stay! What a treat to get out of town with great friends and then get treated like royalty at Wedgewood Hotel & Spa! Can't wait til our next getaway. I may even make reservations to take my husband back for a romantic weekend. Review #24:Tired and overpriced. We had a mid floor \u201csuite.\u201d Suite is a misnomer. The room was old and tired. The tv in the bedroom was bolted to the ceiling. The tv in the sitting area, was a beat-up old RCA. The bedroom part of the \u201csuite\u201d was cramped. Rather than a door separating the rooms, there was a stained thick tapestry/window curtain. The furniture was old and tired. The walls were dreary, dank and simply depressing. Service was not up to par for the price. The recommendation for a dinner was awful \u2013 don\u2019t rely on the concierge. Overall DEFINITLEY NOT at all worth the price charged. Also, the garbage trucks that frequent the ally are loud. Look elsewhere. Something good \u2013 the chocolates that they leave for you are delicious. Review #25:Well presented hotel. Rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. Good location for downtown Vancouver. Lots of positives. Make sure you get a room at the front (overlooking Hornby St) as a room to the rear has a terrible view and the noise from the alley below starts at 5:30am. Overall, would recommend for a short stay. Review #26:The Bacchus bar/lounge/restaurant is so civilized. I find this type of boutique hotel charming and as a single for the most part traveller I feel very safe here. It is a perfect location. The welcome box of chocolates are superb and the evening turndown with cookies and water is so nice. Review #27:This was our 5th stay at this hotel in the last 2 years. We always stay in the deluxe executive,and it is first class, (especially for romantic escapes). The hotel is perfectly located just off of robson street, which is perfect for shopping and checking out downtown restaurants. The executive room is spacious, well lit, and the bathtub for two in the corner of the room is spectacular. We try to book when the free valet parking and breakfast at Baccus. We have stayed at many downtown hotels (pan pacific, wall centre, sutton place) but this is the best of the lot, and we will continue to stay there. On one of our stays, the hotel didn't live up to the bar they had set for themselves. I contacted the manager, and he pleaded with us to let them make it up to us, and make it up they did, in a BIG way.. The whole Wedgewood experience starts when you walk into the warm, inviting lobby. As you get off the elevator, the hallways smell of spiced pot pouri. The hotel rooms are very clean, and I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a romantic getaway... Review #28:We recently stayed at the Wedgewood for four nights while visiting Vancouver. It's a wonderful and quiet place to come home to after a long day of hiking and sightseeing. A little bit older and more sedate than the larger hotels but that is part of its charm. The staff is very helpful and accomodating. A suggestion - if you are thinking of going to Whistler for the day, Avis is only one block away and it is an easy drive. They open at 7:00am and have late night drop off arrangements. You can stay at the Wedgewood and still have a full day in Whistler without changing hotels. Special rates are sometimes available for the Wedgewood and, if you can find one, you can stay in a nice luxury boutique hotel for about the same price or only a little more than the mass market ones the cruise lines use. Review #29:We spent time in Vancouver for the weekend. The hotel was amazing. Beautiful decor, clean, and tasteful. The staff were very hospitable and professional. The restaurant was amazing! Food was great! Have to try it. The room was very spacious and well appointed with high quality linens. Location was perfect. It was a quick walk to everything. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #30:Vancouver has so many great hotel options that it was difficult to choose. We chose the Wedgewood because it ranked high with Trip Advisor AND because it was recommended by two different couples we ran into while traveling who are Vancouver locals. From the moment you arrive at the entry untilnthe day you depart you are treated as a celebrity. We had a King Suite for a week as this was a special 25 th Anniversary celebration. Vancouver was our original honeymoon destination so we were excited to return. Wow! This is a boutique hotel. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. The bed pillows were awesome as were the linens. Fresh cookies were delivered every evening as was ice. Coffee was replenished twice a day if needed. The hotel bar is upscale but comfortable and inviting. Guests are treated to live piano music (Elton John/Billie Joel style) every evening. The Wedgewood is in the heart of downtown and not on the water so the views are more reminiscent of city culture vs. the harbor. It is an easy walk every where. The only cab ride we took was from and back to the airport. Vancouver offers many, many great restaurants sand many of them are in the downtown area near this restaurant. There is shopping all around the hotel. LV, Gucci, Hermes or head in another direction for China town and street vendors. Review #31:The hotel rooms and decor are super combined with a great location (if there is such a thing in downtown Vancouver). The location being very close to downtown Vcr gets busy in the small lounge/breakfast room with non residents. In our view this hotel is extremly pretentious, A Maitre`d that floats around whilst the hard working breakfast staff cant cope and need help, food that is pretty to look at and very adventourous but falls well short of haute cuisine. Whilst the rooms are comfortable and spacious and the cookies at night are a nice touch, there the most expensive cookies you will ever buy. Overall a very expensive hotel. Review #32:My wife and I just returned from spending a long winter weekend at the Wedgewood between Jan 4 and 8, 2006. After reading the near flawless reviews of the Wedgewood, with great anticipation we booked a junior suite. We found slightly lower pricing on the hotel's web site and ended up paying about $185 USD on average per night. We were assigned a room on 11th floor and, although close to the elevator, we couldn't hear a thing. Overall, the staff is fantastic and the hotel is well appointed but for those expecting a 'W' type room experience, the Wedgewood might be a little disappointing. While comfortable, the room had very small TVs and the bathroom, considering we were in a junior suite, was surprisingly small. While I still would rate the experience close to a 9 out of 10, we frankly thought the hotel room would have slightly better amenities. Bottom line, the Wedgewood with its top notch customer service and location will not disappoint, however, this likely won't be the best hotel experience in a major international city. Review #33:We stayed here for 2 nights in May 2010 and were very impressed with the service from all staff and also for small touches such as free bottled water provided every day (3 bottles due to triple share), 3 sets of towels etc. Not always the case at other hotels. Location was excellent, close to all attractions and transport. I would recommend booking here if you manage to get one of their special rates. Also staff were extremely prompt in answering queries. I booked with the hotel directly and noticed that all my email queries and requests were answered promptly- takes a day at most for replies, which when you consider that I communicated from Aust was great service, Sheldon in particular was very pleasant. A great hotel, thoroughly recommended. Review #34:A very well run hotel without some of the annoying \"cool\" factor that affects some of the newer properties in the City. Highly professional and pleasant service. Rooms are a bit frayed at the seams - carpet, upholstery, furniture all a bit dated and ready for an upgrade, but the location is superb, and overall experience very satisfactory. Review #35:I recently stayed at the Wedgewood twice over a span of two weekends. For the first visit I was in a one bedroom suite... generously large by Vancouver standards... with an excellent hideabed mattress for my daughter. The second visit found me in a standard room... also spacious and refined. Breakfast at Bacchus was included both times, along with free valet parking. Location downtown was unbeatably close to Robson St shopping (1/2 block), restaurants like Coast and Joe Fortes (2 blocks), Vancouver Art Gallery (2 blocks), and Rogers Arena (7 blocks). I got a deal through the hotels website that was excellent. We look forward to coming back. Review #36:We were excited about staying at a hotel belonging to the Relais & Chateaux chain since we had not stayed at one in a while. Many aspects of the experience met our expectations. We had a nicely decorated small suite, and we found the valets who park the cars to be exceptionally friendly and helpful. We have folding bikes that we need to have stored, so we are more of a bother than most people to that part of the staff. But these men were full of good advice and cheerfully helped us whenever we asked. Also the restaurant is beautiful with a pleasant staff and good food. Our only real complaint was about the toilet in the bathroom of our suite. It leaked. Water formed around the hinges of the seat and on the floor of the room. We were told at the desk that condensation is a problem in Vancouver and that caused a problem with toilets. It is strange that we have stayed in Vancouver a half dozen times and never had this problem before. Housekeeping did put towels around the base of the toilet and controlled the situation somewhat. But I think that when the client is paying well in excess of $300 per night, the bathroom should function correctly. They did half heartedly offer to move our room, but indicated that all of the toilets had this problem, some less than others. Because of this problem, we would not stay at this hotel again.l Review #37:My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Wedgewood for our honeymoon. They upgraded our room at no additional cost and gave a beautiful suite with an amazing bathroom and large balcony. Unfortunately, we were next to a couple of rooms being renovated and were awoken every morning (8 AM) to loud noises. However, it only mildly hampered our stay, as everything else was outstanding. Our first night there we ate at the hotel restaurant and were treated very well. They made us special vegetarian dishes that were definitely 5 star meals. We also received complimentary champagne and dessert once the pianist told them we were on our honeymoon! The room was luxurious and the entire staff was overwhelmingly helpful and friendly. I will definitely be staying there again the next time I'm in Vancouver. I'd recommend this to anyone who can afford a little pampering. Review #38:The Wedgewood was fantastic. My husband and I stayed during the weekend of the finale of the Celebration Of Light fireworks. The staff was amazing. Not only did they leave chocolates and wine in the room for us, the housekeeping staff was pleasant and well trained and the valet staff was polite and courteous. I would definitely recommend this hotel to ANYBODY and we'll definitely be going back when we have the time! ! Review #39:My fiance & I spent a few nights at the Wedgewood Hotel at the end of Oct 2005. We loved the hotel. Like others who've reviewed this hotel, we were upgraded to a suite. There were complimentary chocolates - such a treat! The hotel looked a little stuffy, but the staff certainly wasn't. The room was really spacious, and the bathroom was spectacular. It had a separate shower area with a glass door, along with a full bath. The cookies at turndown made us feel truly pampered. We ate one evening at Bacchus. The food was fantastic, but we were a bit unprepared wardrobe-wise for the elegance. Despite our being underdressed, we got the same special service as everybody else. My one complaint was that sometimes the water pressure was low, & there was little hot water. Aside from that, I LOVED my stay. The hotel is in a great location - easy to access the shopping & great restaurants that Vancouver has to offer. I can't wait to return! Review #40:I just returned from a stay at the Wedgewood. I love old-world, boutique hotels. The Wedgewood's lobby and restaurant were beautiful and lived up to my expectations. Also, the location is great. However, my room was dated and tired. Until the hotel refurbishes its rooms, I would choose to stay at another hotel in Vancouver. Review #41:I was just at the Wedgewood for one night and was not as impressed with it as I had expected to be, based on the website and reviews. The blousy Olde Englishe decor is fussy and overbearing, and not even well executed - the woodwork is cheaply done and the hallways narrow and dimly lit. This may have been a \"boutique\" hotel at one time, but nowadays, people expect something a little smarter, classier and more polished. On the plus side, a great location, and wonderful staff. Review #42:I was thrilled upon entering the gorgeous Wedgewood Hotel and Spa. I trust the Relais & Chateux brand, and it lived up to its luxurious standard. The room was large and included a terrace the length of the apartment-like suite. Comfortable amenities abounded, including full living room furniture, DVD players for the flat-screen televisions, large marble bathrooms, and delightful turndown service complete with cookies and spring water. Bacchus lounge and restaurant in the hotel's lobby was a fabulous place to enjoy a martini next to a roaring fire. Service was impeccable, and the location ideal. I'd absolutely go back to the Wedgewood. Review #43:We stayed here for 5 nights for part of our honeymoon and just thought it was wonderful. We really feel like we couldn't have picked a better hotel in Vancouver. The lobby, bar and restaurant are beautifully decorated - very opulent. We spent many an hour enjoying cocktails in the bar in the evening - it had a wonderful atmosphere. We enjoyed 2 evening meals in the restaurant which were superb, the food was out of this world. The breakfasts managed to better those that we had enjoyed in our hotel in Banff - an impressive achievement! We were lucky enough to be given an upgrade to our room, which was beautiful. It had a balcony with a great view of the Art Gallery and the city, and a spa bath in the corner of the room. The bathroom was lovely with a huge walk-in shower. It was a nice touch that someone left cookies for us each evening when they did the turn-down service. All the staff were extremely helpful and polite - we felt very at home even though it was obviously a big treat for us to be staying in a hotel of this quality. The bar and restaurant service was extremely organised and attentive - they seemed to anticipate things you need before you thought of them yourself! The location of the hotel couldn't have been better - it really is in the heart of downtown. We were very sad to leave and would love to travel back one day to stay again. Review #44:Stepping into the Wedgewood is to step into an oasis of calm, where staff remember who you are and greet you by name. You feel as if you are returning to a stately old, gracious home. The hotel is beautifully and tastefully refurbished. Bathrooms are modern and elegant. The \"mod cons\" are present, but ever so discreet. Suites and guest rooms are luxuriously comfortable. There is a suberb restaurant, with an award winning chef, where the food is always outstanding. The restaurant is decorated Victorian style, with comfortable sofas and armchairs. It provides both casual or intimate dining spaces, especially if one is lucky enough to be seated in front of the beautiful fireplace. And then there is the spa. To the weary traveller, there's no better place to relax! The Wedgewood is truly a gem, situated in the heart of Vancouver's shopping, business and entertainment areas. A beautiful hotel in a beautiful location for those lucky enough to experience it and its special ambience. Review #45:Not nearly a great value for the money. The staff smiles more than it performs and made some mistakes that embarassed us and the couple in the room to which they sent us. Lots of apologies, but clearly, practiced and symbolic politeness. The room itself was in fact no better than many others for much, much less in Vancouver, and not nearly the quality of niche hotels there and in Seattle. The bar was friendly and good, the continental breakfast average and it was nice to get the chocolates and cookies with turndown. But, it's not nearly the value of other niche hotels in the city, or even some of its nearby, traditional competitors. We were disappointed. Review #46:The 20 participants in our conference were unanimous in their praise of the service provided by each and every member of the hotel staff, from the first experience at check-in through to the incredibly attentive team that saw to our needs thoughout the day. The old world charm and general ambience of the hotel set the tone for our conference and certainly put the team in the right frame of mind for inventive and collaborative thinking. We would not hestitate to recommend the Wedgewood to customers, colleagues, friends , and family. Review #47:I second the reviews that were put up about this hotel. I managed to get a good rate for the three nights that three of us were at the hotel. No real view but well appointed rooms and good beds. Wi fi and tv worked, etc The staff is wonderful, people remember your name and what you like. I fell in love with one of the staff, Wanda, the Breakfast Goddess, she remembered what we like to eat and had it waiting for us when we went down in the morning. Lovely, kind lady, who deserves special mention. All of the staff were nice and seemed surprised and grateful to be tipped tho I saw others tipping them as well. A well trained group of people. Hotel is in the middle of a busy commercial section as are most of the hotels, no parking on the street and yes, everything, but everything, is expensive in Vancouver. Hotel is a nice choice. Review #48:We stayed at the Wedgewood Hotel in downtown Vancouver for our third anniversary and were not disappointed in the least! Our room was rather spacious and located on the east side overlooking the courthouses, art museum and gardens. I have never seen an oversized bathtub located not in the bathroom, but in the sleeping area itself! Made it quite unique and fun!! Location of the hotel is near most shopping and restaurants so it makes things quite accessible.Service was extremely prompt and courteous in everything that they did. We needed extra coffee....and there it was....in less than 5 minutes!! The front desk was always helpful and able to answer our every question about Vancouver. The lounge area was romantic, mysterious and comfortable for either drinks, dessert, or breakfast! When we come back to Vancouver in the future, we would definately stay at the Wedgewood again! Dinner at West again too!! ! Review #49:I stayed at the Wedgewood at the end of January when I was in Vancouver on a business trip. I enjoyed my stay. I was in an Executive room with two double beds and the room was very nice. Our room view was really only into the next building, but the weather wasn't the best so it didn't matter. I thought my bed was great. The bathroom was super clean - always a plus! I also had a facial at the Spa and loved every minute of that. The staff at the Spa were very gentle and my skin and I enjoyed the treatment very much. Review #50:We spent three wonderful days in this beautiful, stylish hotel. The room was appointed with a very comfortable sofa and wing chair and small bar at the one end. In the bedroom was an amazingly comfortable king bed with top end linens . Both living and bedroom had large windows overlooking Robson Square and both rooms featured large flat screen TVs. The big winner in this room was the gorgeous shower and separate deep bathtub, again with the high quality linens and amenities. Every person we encountered in the Wedgewood was both professional and very accommodating. Check in was a breeze and the elevators are both fast and secure. Each floor only has eight rooms, so you are never far from the elevator. Be aware that parking is by valet at additional cost but is quick and the service is as friendly as every other department in this property. We look forward to returning next spring for our thirtieth anniversary. Review #51:We stayed for two nights at the Wedgewood and found it delightful. Our room, 8th floor, was large and handsomely furnished and equipped. The staff was friendly and efficient. A fine continental breakfast was provided each morning. Our meals at the in-house lounge/restaurant - the Bacchus-- - were excellent. We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Vancouver and looking for a special place to spend some time enjoying. Review #52:We stayed for 3 nights in a jr. suite king room which had a living room and bedroom with drapery across the doorway between and a small balcony. We were on the back of the hotel so there was no view, but it was quiet. (Currently Robson Sq. across from the front of the hotel is under construction, so I doubt any \"views\" are great right now.) The service was excellent--understated, friendly and professional. Entire property was elegant and well maintained with top quality amenities throughout. This is a small, refined European style hotel with a quiet, reserved atmosphere decorated in muted colors and historical prints. It is centrally located in the downtown area and everything downtown is within walking distance. There are many small cafes and restaurants nearby. The hotel bar and restaurant is lovely with excellent food and cocktails (and pricey)--dark panelled wood, velvet drapes and a fireplace. We enjoyed cocktails and dessert one evening and breakfast one morning. The room included free internet; the wireless worked well, but was rather slow; the wired connection in our room worked intermittently which might be an issue if work was a prime activity. We were treated to cookies each evening in our room which was a nice touch. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Review #53:The best thing about the Wedgewood is the location. It is right across the street from the Vancouver Art Museum and one block from world class shopping. The hotel itself is small but inviting and has a very proper english vibe. It is luxurious without being too over the top. The rooms are small but very nice and the bathrooms seem newly updated. The restaurant/bar downstairs had good food and fun live music at night. The staff is very friendly and helpful, so much that you feel like they know you as soon as you check in. The workout facility was a bit small as it was tucked into one small area just past the spa and it only offered one treadmill, one bike, one eliptical machine and a small weight set. Overall a very nice hotel that has a great location downtown. Review #54:My husband and I stayed here for our wedding night after having our intimate reception dinner in Bacchus restaurant (part of Wedgewood Hotel). It's a beautiful hotel but I still feel as though it's overpriced. I paid about $350 or $400 (can't quite remember now as it was 8 months ago) for the one night and I thought because I was spending about $1500 having my wedding dinner at Bacchus and it was my wedding night they would have given me a discount but they didn't. I was able to negotiate a late check-out (2pm, not that great) and they gave us a bottle of sparkling wine but that's about it. The room was beautiful with a jacuzzi tub and a nice big bed but, the more I think about it, it still wasn't worth the price necessarily. The hotel is definitely clean and definitely in a nice area. I would say this hotel is a great place to stay for a splurge - wedding night, anniversary, one night of a longer trip but I can't imagine it would be worth the $300 or more a night to stay here for a full week. Other fancy hotels would have more amenities and maybe a kitchenette in the room or something. Review #55:The hotel is situated down town close to the art museum. Upon arrival, we were given a suite on the 8th floor. The hallway to the suite and the suite itself both smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. To the hotels credit we were quickly transferred to a suite on the 6th floor - where this problem did not exist. We had a nice balcony - that was a good length and spotlessly clean, and the bathroom was modern - and the shower had great water pressure, but the bedroom and living room both showed their age. The living room was narrow and the TV armoire crowded the room from one side and the oversized 1990's type couch from the other. In my opinion, the room furnishings need to be updated - while maintaining a classical look, and the wet bars - with drop ceilings definitely need \"work\". We had dinner at the hotel, our waiter was attentive and the dinner was very good, but nothing about it was truly memorable. (Nothing stood out as being unusual, creative, or the best ever) With all of that said, the service throughout the hotel was excellent. Review #56:We spent two nights at the Wedgewood during a recent holiday to Canada. We were extremely impressed with the hotel. It has a lovely atmosphere, it is small, personal, the staff are very friendly and it felt like a home from home. Our junior suite was lovely. Extremely spacious, and comfortable and it didn't feel like just another hotel room. The hotel also benefits from being in a fantastic location right in the center of downtown, which helped make exploring Vancouver very easy. P.S the cookies at turndown are super! Review #57:Trip Advisor has rarely given us bad advice in our travels and very definitely was spot on about the Wedgewood! This property was on par with such boutique wonders like the Rusty Parrot in Jackson Hole and the Covent Garden Hotel in London. In fact, when we walked in and were greeted by every member of the staff, and then saw the Bacchus restaurant/bar, we remarked how reminiscent of the Covent Garden it seemed. The only disappointment was the size of the spa which had few facilities besides some treatment rooms, but the treatments and technicians were SUPERB! Extremely convenient downtown location allowed us to walk to a lot of places and loved the energy and everything about it! Review #58:We stayed for three nights at the Wedgewood in a Deluxe Executive King under the 25 Anniversary Promotion. We received 25% off the room plus 25% off all meals in Bacchus. We ate breakfast everyday at the hotel and had one dinner at Bacchus as well. The staff accomodated every request and were very pleasant. We were addressed by name most of the time. During our stay on Saturday, the entire street in front of the hotel (Hornby) was closed for a city block due to a large crane loading glass into a building across the street. The hotel was very apologetic about the situation, but it had little bearing on anything other than trying to get a cab. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! Review #59:Thank goodness we were staying at The Wedgewood because it poured rain for the entire week. We found ourselves looking forward to returning to our hotel each day and night. The linens are lovely and the twice daily housekeeping visit was much appreciated. We decided to check out for two days for a quick visit to Whistler and the hotel offered to keep some or our luggage so that we could travel lightly. Oh yes and the location is just great. We will definitely stay there next time. Review #60:My wife and I stayed at the Wedgwood in April 2006 and paid about $200 per night. The rooms were very nice and we enjoyed the large tub in the bedroom. However, the service at this hotel is best described as indifferent. The front desk (more of a corner desk actually) was not helpful. The staff seemed young (I am 36) with very little insight into the local sights or how to even get around. They are not rude or even unpleasant but just don\u2019t seem to really care. I don\u2019t blame them but I also would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is not familiar with the city. Review #61:This is a very nice, cozy boutique hotel. I had a standard room and it was very spacious. The linens and the bed were absolutely luxurious! The balcony was not your usual step out...it was huge with room for a table and chairs -- would have been wonderful to sit outside in the summer. The hotel is close to Robson street so lots of shopping and restaurant choices -- really nice area. The lobby and lounge are beautiful with an old world feel. The chocolates in the room and the welcome note from the hotel owner were nice. The front desk and restaurant staff were nice and helpful...and so was the doorman who worked there in the morning. The younger staff who were at the door in the afternoon could brush up a bit on customer service...no offer of assistance with my luggage, no eye contact or greeting as i reached the door--basically it seemed that they did not want to be there...it was a little annoying. Review #62:Several friends and I stopped by the Bacchus lounge on Friday night and had a fantastic time. Great atmosphere, wide array of late evening drinks (e.g., single malts, port, martinis, etc) and amazing desserts. We sampled three of their dessert options and were blown away. We've stayed at the Wedgewood before and marvelled at the service and the restaurant was no different. We were seated quickly and the wait staff was attentive but not intrusive. To top it off, we were brought (free of charge) a basket of seasonal fruit and nuts to graze on as we finished our drinks... Definitely one of the best rooms in the city, with service to match. Review #63:This review is long overdue. My husband and I stayed at the Wedgewood for four nights while on vacation in June 2007. We had a lovely stay, and everyone on staff was wonderful. The rooms were elegantly appointed and comfortable, the bar has to be one of the best hotel bars in North America, and the location near Robson Street is excellent. Great attention to every detail. I have to single out the folks in the kitchen at Bacchus, however, for they truly went the extra mile for us. During our first full day in Vancouver we pulled up several tasty-looking Dungeness crabs while salmon fishing near the Fraser River. Lee Parsons and his talented sous chef graciously agreed to prepare some of the crabs for us for dinner that night, and what a feast! The tarragon beurre blanc was divine, and the accompaniments were perfect. It will easily be one of the more memorable meals my husband and I have had together. If you want an extra-indulgent stay in Vancouver, this is the place. Review #64:I had our top clients in Vancouver from the U.K. One of them is well traveled and a gourmet fiend. I was hosting a dinner and chose Bacchus Restaurant at the Wedgewood Hotel because I trusted them completely to make the evening a success - and they did, in spades. Our waiter helped me negotiate through the wine list so I didn't bankrupt our company but didn't embarass ourselves in front of our clients. The service throughout the dinner was superb and lacked nothing. The food presentation was terrific and everyone enjoyed their choice. Most importantly, the service was sincere and not put-on - the team clearly wanted to ensure our dinner was perfect. Prior to dinner, we had cocktails in the bar - Christine, our server, was super attentive and adapted to the various \"styles\" of our guests - some were serious , some were more relaxed - she \"read\" each perfectly. Our clients have entered into a long term partnership with our company because they value the commitment to high quality and service we think our company delivers. When asked why I chose to bring them to Bacchus at the Wedgewood - I said for the same reason - I value them and more importantly, trust them to do the right thing - all the time. Review #65:An expensive hotel, but each room with balcony (good for smoking in a non-smoking city), half the balconies overlook beautiful Federal Court square. Good location right downtown. Quiet, with accomodating and professional service. You're paying for what you get. Make sure your room overlooks the square - the other side overlooks office buildings. Review #66:I just got married over the July 4th weekend and spent a few absolutely wonderful days and nights at the Wedgewood Hotel. My new husband and I decided to pamper ourselves in town at the Wedgewood before we set forth on our honeymoon. The room we were provided was luxurious and the service was top notch. We both relaxed in the expert hands of the masseurs at the spa and enjoyed sumptious dinners at Bacchus Restaurant in the hotel. By the way, Bacchus has the best martinis in town! I can't wait to book us in for our first anniversary celebration. Review #67:Our first trip to Vancouver and we lucked out with the Wedgewood recommendation. The room amenities are first class. The staff is friendly and well informed. The location is great for seeing the city and after a long day you feel at home once you come through the doors. The restaurant is excellent. We highly recommend this hotel. Review #68:The Wedgewood hosted our Wedding ceremony in early September. We are living in Florida but traveled to Vancouver to share our celebration with family. The staff at the Wedgewood made the entire event, from planning to post-event, a remarkable experience. They epitomize \"outstanding service\". We were so pleased with the experience that we chose the hotel to pamper mom with an afternoon at their spa for her birthday. The look on her face afterwards was \"priceless\". Thanks!! Brian and Cynthia Review #69:We just stayed in one of the newly rennovated penthouse suites at the Wedgewood, and it was AMAZING!!!! We had a gorgeous, spacious living room with a fireplace and a big bathroom with a double size jacuzzi tub that opened into the bedroom. It was beautiful and truly first class. The bellman told us that Pierce Brosnan had just vacated our room after finishing his lastest movie! We had room service for dinner one night, and our waiter fussed over us to make sure everything was perfect! The food was delicious and in the mornings we had breakfast in our bathrobes on our private terrace - it felt like a scene out of Pretty Woman! I had a facial in the Spa that was the best I've ever had, and a fabulous massage. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!! This a great hotel. It has a very cosy, personal feel about it and the staff really make you feel like they care. There is a very hip crowd at the bar downstairs too, which is fun. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Vancouver with excellent service and a prime location - look no further! Book one of the new penhouse suites if you can - they are worth it! ! Review #70:OK we didn't like Vancouver, but loved this Hotel, which was the saving grace really. If shopping is your thing, this place is perfect as it's just around the corner from the main shopping street in Vancouver. The staff are very nice and attentive. The rooms are excellent, we stayed here for 2 nights before doing a Grizzly bear tour up the coast, then returned for a 3rd night before leaving Vancouver. We were upgraded on the 3rd night to a suite which was fantastic. I think Vancouver is one of those places you either love or hate, either way, this Hotel is well recommended. Review #71:From the moment you stand on the pavement outside the Wedgewood you are treated like royalty. The staff cannot do enough for you. We went there on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a gorgeous room with a complimentary bottle on the first night and chocolates on the second. Each night we also had fresh cookies left in the room when the staff did the turn down service :-) The room was spacious and comfortable with free wi-fi (something a lot of the hotels we stayed in did not offer). We did not eat in the restaurant but did go to the bar. Once again the service was excellent and the staff very friendly. The reception staff were also incredibly friendly and helpful when it came to ordering taxi's and suggesting things for us to do. I filled out a questionnaire about the hotel before we left and when we got back home there was a lovely letter from the hotel saying how much they appreciated the feedback. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Vancouver. We also stayed in the Pan Pacific which was nice but a lot more business like and given the choice again I would definitely choose the Wedgewood. Review #72:When we arrived (my 27 year old son and I) we found the valet parking available immediately. Staff were quick to gather out equipment and suitcases. Check in was a breeze...they welcomed me back again. Quick again for check-in. Room was very nice with two large beds (as planned and expected) but there were cookies and candies (unexpected) which made it a very welcoming impression. Staff asked if we needed information on where to eat, but we already had an idea of where to go. The room was quiet, on the back side of the hotel which was nice also. We had a good sleep. Despite our early checkout (5:45 am) staff had the car waiting out front and checkout took almost a minute. All in all another great stay at the Wedgewood. Review #73:My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. The hotel was beatifully presented and our room was spacious and included a very large bath tub which was accessed directly from the bedroom area - very original! The service was fine although one of the receptionists (long blonde hair) always struggled to raise a smile! The hotel is situated in a very good place, right in the heart of Vancouver and within walking distance of pretty much anything. No complaints at all and the cookies were a nice little extra. It makes you wonder why other hotels don't do a similar thing. Its funny how something that costs a hotel so little is the one thing most people remember.... Review #74:We had a large suite that was lovely but the furniture was not that comfortable.Depending on who was at the front desk the service could be excellen to poor. Breakfast and lunch in the restaurant were delicious and I did not think it was outrageously expensive. I just wish my check in process had been more pleasant and that the manager had actually called me when I asked for that to occur. I thought the assistant managet was very inefficient.. I think that this hotel can be wonderful when things go smoothly which did occur after the first day. For the price paid I expected top notch service in every regard on a regular basis. The location is fabulous. Review #75:This hotel is in a very noisy area - a hospital is close by and I believe a fire station. We heard sirens until midnight, then fell asleep. At 7 am, there was street construction noise. Besides that, the rooms were nice. I'd recommend the better suites to the minimal one bc it only has a drape to separate the rooms and the bathroom is in the sitting room (doesn't work well with kids). Also, the bedroom was small as was the sitting room. The staff is very friendly. Review #76:Very nice hotel. Good sized room, which seemed to have been recently refurbished. Bathroom looked new. Good location, close to the main shopping area and walkable to everything. Good restaurant recommendations from the staff. Nice bar and restaurant in the hotel, too. Seemed more intimate and friendly than the other top-end hotels in Vancouver. Review #77:My family surprised me by coming to Vancouver to visit and putting me up at the Wedgewood with them. So first I was lucky to have my family come for a visit, and second I was lucky to stay at the Wedgewood. The hotel is really beautiful. Definitely upscale but very unpretentious. I'm a casual person and don't like to go somewhere where I feel uncomfortable. I'd just written a week's worth of exams so didn't feel or look my best when I arrived. But no matter how I looked or felt, I was made to feel at home and very welcome by the staff at The Wedgewood. The rooms are beautiful and have a European feel to them. We didn't get a chance to use the big soaker tub in the room, but with more time I definitely would've indulged. We did, however, book deep tissue massages at the Spa located inside the hotel and I couldn't be more glad that we did because they were AMAZING. The massage was very necessary after the stress of exams and the using the steam room beforehand was invigorating, to say the very least. We had dinner at Bacchus Lounge on our first night and the food & service were impeccable. I'm on a very restrictive diet at the moment and the chef was more than accommodating when I had to make numerous adjustments to the menu items. Everything tasted fantastic and was beautifully prepared. Our entire party of seven were very pleased with their meals. I cannot wait to stay at the Wedgewood again! Look no further when deciding where to stay in our beautiful city of Vancouver! Review #78:We were so pleasantly surprised by the Wedgewood Hotel. We visited Vancouver during all-time-record-breaking heat and the Wedgewood was like a sanctuary in the middle of the hot city. Every time we came back to the room we were able to slip between the cold sheets and refresh and rejuvenate. Within 30 minutes of checking in, everyone on the staff knew our names and they went out of their way to make our stay just wonderful. The restaurant is just delicious and the room (we had a suite) was just right, luxurious and elegant, without being over the top. Review #79:We booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews for a last minute night away, and were very happy with the choice. The hotel is lovely, well appointed, and the rooms were beautiful. We had a great view of downtown Vancouver, and really enjoyed the room. The only small problem was that our room was not ready at check in, but they switched our floors and brought us to a room as quickly as possible. We had lunch and drinks in the attached restaurant which also has a great atmosphere. We were able to walk throughout downtown very easily. Great choice, and we'll be back. Review #80:I wanted to try this hotel because of the location to shopping - I normally stay at the Pan Pacific. I was not disappointed. We tried out the sauna in the spa and the amenities were excellent - great on a cold and rainy day. They have computers in the business center which are free - with small screens and slow access but better than nothing! Every single hotel staff that we encountered asked if they could do anything for us - every one was friendly and kind. The bathroom was my favorite - oversized tub and gorgeous tile. Hand held shower head - both the towels and the sheets were of the highest quality. I will definitely stay at this hotel again. We didn't try the bar or restaurant instead went down the street to the restaurant at the Blue Horizon hotel. Review #81:WE loved this hotel. The people were quite nice and helpful at the desk. Service was impeccable and our rooms were quite large with a balcony. Great location and the bar restaurant is awesome with the windows opened up onto the street- felt like a quaint French hotel. It earns it's Relais Chateau rating. Review #82:From the minute the valet staff greeted us we were made to feel at home. The room (one king and a separate area pullout) was immaculate with a beautiful, updated bathroom. We decided to eat at the inhouse restaurant, Bacchus, the food was delicious, the service was pleasing. Due to the piano bar being right next to the restaurant it was a tad difficult to have an easy conversation, it seemed, however, there were tables further from the bar area. The location couldn't have been better just a few steps from Robson Street. We would definitely go back. Review #83:When we arrived we were greeted by an exceptionally friendly valet - this was a pattern as all of the valets we interacted with were friendly and helpful, as were the reception staff. This was useful during our stay, as the concierge seemed to have little knowledge of the city. We were upgraded to a 2 room, 2 bathroom suite on check-in and the room did, as requested, overlook the square. Unfortunately there was a lot of building work going on, so it was not an attractive or quiet view, but not the hotel's fault. The suite was large, although with a slightly awkward layout, and the ensuite had a large spa bath with a large hatch through to the bedroom so that someone in the bath could watch the bedroom TV or converse with their partner in the bedroom. Overall I would say that the hotel is very luxurious (and priced accordingly), but good value compared to some hotels we stayed in BC and AB. Review #84:Elegant yet friendly. Great location in downtown. Super staff. They had the answers to our every question. Cookies and Chococolates to die for . In addition, we spent a fabulous evening in the Bacchus Restaurant celebrating our anniversary. We'd go back in a flash. Review #85:I surprised my husband with a birthday weekend at the Wedgewood. I booked on the special occasion package that they offer and we weren't disappointed at all. We were in a deluxe executive room on the 9th floor. The bed was really confortable and the shower was great. We got a voucher for the Bacchus restaurant which was fantastic. Well worth it even without the voucher. The continental breakfast was included with the package and started our mornings off on the right foot. My husband enjoyed a pot of coffee and I enjoyed a hot chocolate with our yogurt parfaits and two pasteries each. We sat and slowly had our breakfast as we people watched from comfy leather chairs and read the complimentary newspaper. The service was first rate and everyone greeted us with a smile. Thanks to everyone at the Wedgewood for making my husband's birthday a truly special occasion. Review #86:We stayed here during our trip to Canada and Alaska for just 2 nights before going on our cruise. We had a great room with balcony and hugh tub in the bedroom! The bar had a great atmosphere and the restaurant was fantastic. Staff very helpful and friendly. All round a very classy place to stay and although not cheap it was a bargin compared to our other hotel The Westin Bayshore!! The only thing missing for us was a nice outdoor terrace to relax with a glass of wine and catch some sun. Stay here and you wont be disappointed Review #87:This is an excellent European-style hotel in Vancouver. It was a repeat visit and the positive views we formed on our previous visits were enhanced. Front desk staff were more than helpful, especially when we left some clothing behind which was found and sent to us very efficiently. The location is excellent, sufficiently away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk everywhere in the centre. The room, a junior suite, was large and very comfortable with separate living and sleeping areas. The biscuits at turndown are a small sign of the delicate touches that the hotel provides. All-in-all another good visit. Review #88:We stayed at the Wedgewood for two nights in July and were very impressed. The rooms are very big for a city centre hotel and well appointed. Beds wonderful! We did not eat at the restaurant but only because the hotel is so centrally placed that we ate out all of the time. A special mention should go to the front desk staff who were really friendly, helpful and smartly turned out. Would definately stay there again. Review #89:We stayed at the Wedgewood after spending a weekend in Whistler and immediately wished we had more than just one night in town. Wedgewood is a charming boutique hotel in a nice area of Vancouver. There were so many extras, from the sunken tub, turn down service, fresh cookies and chocolates. Our room had a great portable map for suggested walks/runs and we took the four mile loop through Stanley park, which was great. We really felt like the staff was looking out for us. We can't wait to come back! Review #90:A very classy hotel. A box of high quality chocolates and a personalized hand written welcome note were already in the room. We stayed in one of the large suites with 2 separate bathrooms (not one of the penthouses). One has a roman marble shower and the other has a huge Jacuzzi tub with shutters that open up into the bedroom. An array of high-end toiletries in both bathrooms. The luxury bed was huge with top quality bedding. This is the cleanest hotel room we have ever stayed in. As soon as we pulled up and were greeted properly we new we had made a good choice. We visited the lively (even on a weekday) bar and stayed late, obviously popular with the rich, hip and unusual. If you enjoy requested birthday wishes from complete strangers and an oompa band announcing your arrival, stay somewhere else (please). This is a discreet hotel, there\u2019s a reason it is popular with movie stars! Everything was handled efficiently and pleasantly, the staff are all pros. Lots of attention to detail such as the doorman ensuring that my wife got into the car with out getting her hair wet when it was raining. We are looking forward to our next stay here. Review #91:This is a superb \"boutique\" hotel well located in the center of the city. It is right in the shopping and business district and close to tourist attractions. The staff are first rate. The Bacchus Restaurant in the hotel is over the top; the food is top notch and the setting is romantic. Cookies and chocolates were provided in the room at the end of the day and a newspaper was hung on the door in the morning. There was free in room WiFi. This was our second visit. The room was a delux King that was exceptionally well appointed. We plan to go back. Review #92:I travelled to Vancouver on business for many years and this hotel was my favorite. When making my reservations for my trips to Vancouver if no rooms were available at the Wedgewood I would change the date of my trip. The location is ideal just next to Robson street and a short walk from the bay. This boutique hotel pampers the guests. By far the best 5 star hotel in Vancouver. Review #93:We stayed at the Wedgewood Hotel and Spa over President's Day Weekend. We chose the hotel because of the reviews written and the Wedgewood Hotel and staff did not disapoint. We arrived a bit early but a suite was available and we were quickly checked in. The room was lovely and very comfortable with a large sofa/chaise combo in the living room that fit the two of us wonderfully. The bedroom had a very comfortable king bed with wonderful linens and pillows. There were little thoughtful touches such as a throw blanket, chocolates upon our arrival, bathrobes and slippers, ice bucket filled daily, nightly turn down service with cookies, etc.. Through out our stay we would find notes in our room thanking us for choosing the Wedgewood and letting us know if we needed anything from reservations at restaurants to recommendations for sight seeing to please let one of the staff know and they would arrange it for us. We did take advantage of the spa and LOVED it. We both had the exfoliation scrubs and then a 90 minute massages that were fabulous! The bar and restaurant were delightful. The bartender made great Ceasar's and the food was lovely; especially the Eggs Benedict. Additionally, the staff was wonderful. They always remembered us as we came and went and always had smiles for us and again asked us at every turn if needed anything or if they could assist us with anything. The only negative that we found was the drainage in the shower, very slow and the 4:00 am Monday morning wakeup by the trash pickup. Other than that we loved our stay and will return when we stay in Vancouver in the future. Review #94:Stayed here only 1 night on our way back from Whistler. We had to get up at 4am, so we went to bed early. We didn't hear another guest the entire time! The hotel is in an older building, however all of the rooms are very well appointed. There was even a bar in the room. Nice views of the city from our balcony (in a standard room). Valet is the only parking option, however it is much cheaper than some of the other hotels in the same area. (I think about $18 a day). Walking distance to quite a few things. The valet attendant was very friendly and willing to help. Would love to come back and stay longer than 1 night! Review #95:My husband and I checked into the hotel late in the evening. We were given a lovely suite, very well appointed on the 8th floor of the front side of the hotel and settled in for a 4 night stay. The first morning was quiet and we enjoyed our day in Vancouver. The hotel is near a nice market, movie theater, Robson street shopping and plenty of good restaurants. Unfortunately, the second morning, I awoke at 7am due to jackhammer noise along with the beep beep beep that construction equipment makes when backing up and general construction noise. There is a large construction project across the street from the hotel so be aware of that. When asked if we could move to something quieter, we were told they get complaints about garbage trucks coming at 5am at the back of the hotel but they would show us another room higher up on the front side. We tried the 11th floor, but the noise was not any better so checked out and went to another hotel down the street. To their credit, they did not penalize us for checking out early due to the problem with the noise. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are very nice, but I do wish they had told us about the construction. I would recommend this hotel to anyone once construction is complete so check first. My ratings of value and sleep quality are due entirely on the basis of the construction noise, otherwise they would have been higher. Review #96:So I went to the amazing Sara Bareilles concert in Vancouver and was fortunate to find this hotel on my iPhone via Google Maps! It was my first time and I will definitively go back! First Amazing thing: They upgraded me to a king suite! The room was awesome and the bed was unbelievable! Second Amazing Thing: The room had a big jacuzzi tub... Third Amazing Thing: The bed...OMG! Sunk in and had a tremendous sleep! Fourth Amazing Thing: WIthin minutes of arriving in my room they delivered a box of edible chocolates! Fifth Amazing Thing: The hotel is within walking distance to everything!! Sixth Amazing Thing: The staff were super friendly! Seventh Amazing Thing: The hotel has a warm and inviting feel.... Wow, I'm going back! Review #97:My wife and I were celebrating a special anniversary so we decided to go to the most talked about hotel in our city and we were certainly not disappointed. We had such a great weekend at the Wedgewood, that we've decided to make it a yearly tradition. The location is amazing, steps away from all the stores, restaurants and theatres and the service couldn't have been more professional and friendly at the same time. We stayed at a Wedgewood Suite beautifully decorated in cool brown and gold tones, silk fabrics and two luxurious spa bathrooms complete with pillar candles and bath salts for the double jetted tub - very romantic!! Breakfast in bed was wholesome and elegantly served, but their Spa was the highlight of our stay. We had to make reservations way in advance because it's so popular and we saw why. They offer a variety of interesting treatments, some for couples. a great eucalyptus steam room and the aestheticians were some of the best we've ever tried. My wife has already made a second appointment. Their Lounge and Restaurant, Bacchus is definitely the place to see and be seen by the elite of Vancouver. We had a great dinner the first evening and just dessert and drinks late the second evening. We will return often. Ken Clark Review #98:We stayed here at the start of our honeymoon in a Wedgewood suite which was fantastic. Nice and large and very comfortable. The room overlooked Robson Square and is only a few minutes walk to Robson street. Very friendly / helpful staff. The cookies at night were gorgeous and a nice touch as was the free net access to check weather / update on lost luggage etc... Jeff. Review #99:I discovered the Wedgewood here on TripAdvisor around three months ago and have since stayed there four times for a variety of reasons and with a different mix of rooms. This hotel has quickly become my preferred Hotel when I visit Vancouver, knocking Sutton Place, The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver and Hyatt out of my top preferred Hotels in the area. The location is perfect! With some of my favourite restaurants all around (The Bellagio or Cactus club for casual and quick, Don Francesco's for a Risotto, Starbucks or Tim's for Coffee...the list goes on!) and Pacific Centre, chapters, and other Robson street shopping just a block away. The Skytrain is your link to everything entertainment and is just a block in either direction. The staff is exceptional. Friendly, bright, chatty, helpful, and genuinely pleasant to talk to. Above all the staff at the Wedgewood is what makes this hotel so very different from others in the area. Most hotels you just want to get through the lobby and to your room with maybe the odd exception to the rule; here at the Wedgewood we find ourselves linger in the lobby to chat with the Valet, Concierge, or desk staff for a moment or two. When you return from an outing they want to know how it was? What did you find at the shops or how was the hockey game? With the Wedgewood I always feel like I'm visiting family, and the box of chocolates at check-in and nightly turn down service with a bottle of water and some cookies sure does help that along! If I could change one thing about the Wedgewood I would take two of their fabulous beds and make a two bedroom suite!", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "LLM"}

The bathroom smelled like sewer water, the front door couldn't open wider, it felt like we were in a motel. Why would marriott make this kind of hotel but it really is not a hotel it's a motel. I don't recamand this hotel (motel). Review #1:Was a bit further away from all the downtown Key West activities than I expected, but nice facility. Helpful staff. Very nice pool area and great free breakfast buffet in the pool area. Room was kind of cramped with very small bathroom. Not a lot of storage or room to put your suitcases, but adequate. I know I read reviews before about the air conditioning units being loud and it's true. If you are a light sleeper, I'd take ear plugs. Only real complaint I have is the pool area is supposed to close at 11:00. All the rooms open up to the pool area, so any activity out there at night can be heard. There was a large group of mostly men that decided to play dominoes. The constant talking and shuffling of the dominoes on the tables echoed throughout the courtyard area and had to be keeping everyone awake. This went on until 2am or so. I would have thought the hotel staff would have cleared them out. Review #2:I found this hotel to be a perfect location for a fun weekend in Key West. The room layouts were unique, spacious and clean. The pool area provided a quiet nice hide away for the morning after the night on the town. This hotel was a quick 5 minute, or $4/person cab ride to Duval St. and dozens of restaurants and pubs. Close to everything, but not a walk to downtown. Review #3:We recently stayed here during our 2 days in Key West. It was quiet, rooms were clean, staff pleasant. The pool is awesome with 12 small fountains spraying into it during the day. Complimentary breakfast is served poolside--nothing spectacular on the menu, but it's a very pleasant way to start the day. Would recommend it, although farther up the island (northeast?) are other places that are directly across from the seawall and might offer better Gulf access/views. Review #4:Just got back from Key West for my sister's 30th. Key West is GREAT! But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what this review is for - Fairfield Inn offered a great front desk team. They were very attentive, informative and friendly. Whether you needed a cab, directions or suggestions on where to eat - what beach to visit - or the best night club, they offered a long list of suggestions with pros and cons. The rooms were quite small though. There were 3 girls in ours and we constantly needed to move out of the way for someone to walk by. However, the beds were GREAT! Very soft and cozy (down pillows). Room 222 offers a lovely view - of the Taco Bell's roof next to the hotel too! Also, this is more of a motel (rather than hotel) - so not sure why they didn't have seats outside the rooms - seemed to have enough room. The pool was very refreshing, and a nice size with plenty of chairs - you never had that feel that the pool was over crowed. My big beef was the location. We took a cab about 4 times a day into Downtown or the beach. With being 5 of us (about $20 a ride) - this was split and generally inexpensive - but I think next time I visit Key West, I'll buck up the extra money and stay at a better location Review #5:The Fairfield Inn is the absolute best value and the staff is nothing short of fantastic. From Lyndsey and the girls at the front desk to Pete our daily bartender to the sweetest breakfast staff, they are what made our trip so memorable. Can't thank you enough for showing our family such hospitality! Review #6:Yes the hotel is a bit far from Old Key West, but we walked and had bikes and it worked for us- Service- very proffesional staff- Front desk, pool bar and breakfast staff were all friendly and had a nice greeting each time we walked by. The pool was clean and never crowded. Another note on service- we had a room without a fridge-we asked for one at check-in and we were told it would be right up( we expected a long wait) we put our luggage on the bed and there was a knock on door and the fridge was delivered! Other nice touches-the internet is free and there are TWO computers with a printer right off lobby. There is a bike rental on site and the bike/scooter storage rack is in garage and covered and safe.The breakfast is more than enough to get you started for the day- Taxis were always waiting and there is a Trolley Stop on site ( Trolley is $$$$ -walk, rent a bike or try the public bus) We totally agree on the LOUD air conditioner-we had to shut it off at night- we turned it down as cold as it could before we went to bed and then shut it down- Review #7:The staff was very Friendly and helpful. They had some good info for our sightseeing. The room was very clean. It was a little small but ok for our needs. The A/C was a little noisey but you get used to it. I would reccomend this place to friends and family. Review #8:Overall the hotel is old, the reception area is good, the pool area very good, but the rooms are awful, we stayed in room 118, the tv remote did not work (ok you can live with that), the air con did not work on auto so had to be on all the time to keep the room at a comfortbale temperature, the drains had a problem in the shower, when you took a shower there was a terrible sewarage smell, the room was small and shabby, but on a positive side the bedding and towels were clean. I did complain about the room at reception and they apologised and we were only staying the one night. Review #9:The wife and I are fresh back from 3 days at the Fairfield inn Key West. What a great experience. The Fairfield was very clean and appeared to be recently remodeled. The pool was a great place to kick back and relax before heading down to Duval to be with the crazies. The breakfast was better than most places with a great selection. Starting off the day sitting outside having our first cup of coffee poolside was the best. Most of all the Staff was very sincere about our helping us out and could not do enough to make sure we had a great stay day. They succeeded! Review #10:We recently visited Key West for a wedding and chose the Fairfield because it carries the Marriott name and had a great rate. We were not disappointed! The rooms were clean, comfortable and the beds ideal for a good night's sleep. The grounds and pool area were extremely clean and well kept. The pool is fantastic and being able to enjoy a complimentary breakfast out there each morning was wonderful. They have a special server named Mirella who took great care of us every day we were there! She is one of the best service industry employees I have encountered in a long time!! The hotel ia close enough to downtown Key West, but without the noise or crowds. It's a quick drive to Duval, where you can find whatever you might want to do. Overall, property was a great value for the price! A few negatives (which were greatly outweighed by positives): Rooms do not have mini-refrigerators (bring a cooler! ); the doors are heavy, hurricane style and slam loudly; and on the back side of the building lives a rooster who will let you know when it's dawn. (If your A/C is on, you probably won't ever hear him though.) Review #11:The room was fairly small, not a suite room. The bathroom had an interesting smell. The rooms are loud. You can hear the people in the adjacent room and if anyone is rolling a suit case down the walk, you will hear it. The staff were extremely friendly which is why I would recommend staying here. It is not typical to spend the whole amount of time in your room on vacation, so as long as it is a place to stay, it is worth it. I was able to book last minute with them and it was worth the trip. It does require a taxi to get downtown, but old charter row is a short walk away. For the fisher, it is a great place to be. Review #12:We almost always stay at Marriott hotels and when we saw the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Key West was a category 5, we made a reservation for two nights. The staff was really great and helpful but the hotel itself was not quite as modern as we expected. One advantage it did have was being a stop on the Old Town Trolley so it was easy to get around but I think next time we would stay closer to downtown. Loved Key West! Review #13:Not impressed with the front desk staff at all- they could not have cared less. No welcome package or thank you to Marriott reward holders. Room was spacious, bed comfortable, but the noise level when you are facing the pool late in the night was bothersome. Gusts making loud noises late into the night did not make for a restful sleep. The bathroom was not clean at all. Glad I was only staying one night, sorry I had to use up all those points. After unpacking went to the bar area and then the front desk to get a few glasses- they do not exist on the property. What a shame, who wants to drink good bourbon out of Styrofoam. The best part was the bicycle rental kiosk on the property. The gentleman there was kind and efficient. Rental price inexpensive, bike functioned and with a basket and lock- everything you need for the 2 mile hike into town for the day. Review #14:If you are going to Key West, stay here! Great pool area and breakfast area. The breakfast area is all open and around the pool area. Beautiful pool area! Plenty of chairs to lay around in and the pool is large enough so you have plenty of room even with a large number of guests. Rooms are very, very small and have very minimal decor/furnishings (the only negative) but the pool area makes this hotel worth it. We have stayed here several times. Only had one bad experience and that was because it was biker week. Since the parking is directly under the rooms, it was Very loud espcially from 12-3 am. We are just more cautious about when we go to the Keys! We will stay at this location every visit. Review #15:Our room was small but very nicely appointed. The hotel itself was very attractive and the staff was welcoming and helpful. Sitting by the pool with its tropical garden, relaxing while having breakfast or an evening drink was great. The location was good and the price reasonable for Key West. Review #16:If you're looking for somewhere to stay at Key West, you'll probably experience sticker shock. I never found anything \"cheap\" that looked appealing enough for me to stay in it. The Fairfield was by far the best value. It has free parking (a big deal in Key West), an awesome pool, and the best free continental breakfast I've ever seen. The staff is extremely friendly as well. The rooms are small but appear recently redone, and I loved the tiled shower. The hotel is a short drive from all the main attractions in Key West, I believe one of the trolley companies also picks up in the parking lot. This is a great value and nice place to stay during your trip to Key West. Review #17:The grounds are beautiful, and the staff is excellent. Continental breakfast was great. There is free parking though it is too far to walk to the beaches and Duval St. from the hotel. However, nothing else was good about the hotel. The rooms are very small. Our room smelled strongly of mildew. The rooms need much better housekeeping and a thorough cleaning. The hotel is on a main thoroughfare and rather noisy at night with cars, scooters, motorcycles passing through. The uncomfortable beds creaked and squeaked. This is by far the worst Fairfield Inn, we have stayed at. Review #18:We were very positively surprised by our stay at The Fairfield Inn in Key West--the staff greeted us warmly, provided useful discount coupons for several restaurants in town and were genuinely pleasant to deal with for the 3 days we stayed--including extending our checkout on a very popular weekend. The hotel is remodeled and the rooms are very adequate, the breakfast included in the room rate provided was really quite good with a broad assortment of food. The fitness room had relatively new equipment. The pool is really quite amazing. It is located within 5-7 minutes of Duval Street. Unlike some other reviews, we found that it was quiet and did not encounter any road noise. The free wifi worked quite well. Review #19:Overall this hotel was like staying at a motel 6. The room was so small I felt like the walls were closing in on me. The room also needed some heavy duty cleaning there was dust on the walls so thick that when the air conditioning was on the dust would blow everywhere. In the shower there was dirt in the corners yuck! We ended up checking out early because it did not feel like a safe place to stay with our family. Review #20:I stayed here with a friend using points. It's the closet of the Marriott hotels to Duval street at about 2 miles away. This hotel does not offer a free shuttle like the other Marriott properties, although it's only about a $10 cab ride down to Duval St. However, it does have a free continental breakfast. The hotel is on N Roosevelt Blvd, which is one of the main roads on the island. The area that it is in is a very commercial area (fast food restaurants, car dealerships, strip malls) but it seems like that is true for most of the chain hotels in Key West. We had a room with two doubles, facing the pool. All rooms appeared to have exterior entrances on the pool side and none appeared to have a personal balcony, just the exterior walkways. The appearance of the room was nice and modern, but the doubles are somewhat small, suites are certainly better. As with all Marriott hotels, the rooms were very clean and the staff were very friendly. The nicest thing about this hotel was its pool area. It was much nicer than I would expect for a Fairfield Inn. There was also an outdoor bar by the pool, I think it stayed open til 7pm. There were a few food/snack options at the bar, but it was mostly there for drinks. If I have the opportunity to stay in Key West again, I would certainly consider this hotel. However, I would likely choose the Courtyard for the free shuttle and slightly nicer rooms. Review #21:Booked a standard room, but could fortunately get a suite. The suites are great! Nice large bed, clean, separate desk and fridge. The standard rooms are very small and do not have any room to store luggage. Very friendly staff at the front desk. Coffee, soda, cookies all for free at the reception area. Great pool and okay gym. Lots of parking space. Just 5 minutes to the old town. Close to shopping and restaurant area's. Review #22:Nice tiles, fresh linen, and clean room. Safe environment. Beautiful pool. Knowledgeable staff helped us get around the island. Don't miss Mallory Square Sunset Celebration and the restaurants on Duval St., many do not accept American Express.Try the sunset catamaran and duo para-sailing. Had a great time! Noisy A/C but would stay again. Review #23:My husband and I did not know what to expect as we had not been to Key West before. This hotel was the cheapest of the chains hotels and we really weren't sure about the accomodations. We were greated by smiling, friendly staff - including the hotel manager - who immediately gave us a drink and mardi gras beads. We found that we had been upgraded to a suite - it was pretty sweet! The pool is georgeous with fountains spraying into the pool (which is heated :o) it made a swim perfect as it was a little chilly out). The room was very nice for the price. These are not 5 star accomodations, but they are the best for the price that you pay. We were able to park under the lights both nights we were there. We would definitely stay here again. Review #24:Our previous hotel offering was a serious disappointment. I booked this in a pinch. Arrived about a half hour after booking. They had all my info ready to go. Check in took all of 3 minutes. The girls were very friendly. Our room was over top of where we parked which was great because we were on a motorcycle. Our room was spotless! A/C was set so the room was cool and comfortable when walking in and not a wall of hot stale air. Bathroom was immaculate as was toilet and sink. Bed was comfortable. Linens were clean. Hotel staff was good about calling a taxi for us. Continental breakfast was okay in the mornings. Could have been better but hey, it was no extra charge! Scooter rental guy was a doll. Gave us a deal and we saved about $70 on two scooters for 8 hours. Gave a complete demonstration about operation of the scooters. Pool area was awesome! Lots of seating areas, chairs, towels, etc. Pool was clean. Pool cleaner guy was there at night taking care of pool. Bar was ok. Drinks were over priced....small plastic cup size frozen drink approx 8oz was $8. Review #25:We stay at Marriotts around the world but never in Key West. So we thought that we would take a chance on this hotel. What a great find. It is located right outside the downtown noise and traffic. Easy to get to all things in \"Key West\". The trolley stopped right in front of the door so we coud leave our car parked. The rooms are bright and ariy and they have the most spectacular pool with a BAR right beside the pool. Having a short swim and a great tropical drink in the sun was a bonus we did not expect. Love this hotel. Review #26:Rooms nothing special; not very spacious and \"weird\" bathroom. Nice breakfast buffet with a lot of different choices (only one type of tea, though). Good location. Friendly staff. We asked for a quiet room when booking online and we probably got the most quiet room at the hotel. Review #27:You get what you pay for! The A/C unit in our hotel room was so loud that we did not get one good nights sleep during our 3 night stay. It sounded like a jet plane taking off every time it kicked on. The bed was very squeaky. The pool was nice, but we did not use it. The breakfast was decent, only because it was free. Had standard continental breakfast items. Now, the biggest complaint........we had a problem with our bill and the Operations Manager, Jeff Emmett, was far from helpful and really needs to be trained in customer service. We had inquired about using a rewards certificate prior to our stay and we were told no problem. When it did not show up on our bill we went to the front desk and we were put into contact with Mr. Emmet. He was very short, told us that there was nothing that he could do, and further told us that there was no one in Marriott that we could call. Finally, he gave us a number to call. The Marriott customer service rep. was very nice and helpful. She asked me to put Mr. Emmett on the phone. He proceeded to argue with her telling her that there was nothing that he can do and and ended up hanging up on her (remember this was a fellow Marriott employee). He ended up fixing it for us, even though earlier he told us that there was not anything that he could do. We are very loyal Marriott customers and timeshare owners and this is not the kind of service that we are used to from Marriott. If this is a franchise, it is no way to represent the \"Marriott\" name. Review #28:This hotel is great. I stayed at the Casa Marina as well during my vacation and in terms of overall value, the Fairfield comes out top every time. The team at the front desk (Ildi, Nora, Kelly and Natalie) were simply awesome, recommending some wonderful trips, they were very friendly and always smiling. They made us feel welcome every time we entered the lobby area and they always called us by our names after we checked in. They are a great bunch of people. The free breakfast, parking and coffee and juice in the lobby just shows how this hotel is different from others In Key West - no rip extra charges. The pool area is fantastic and the rooms are always clean and adequate in terms of size. Thanks for helping us to enjoy our stay and have a great vacation. We will be back Review #29:My family and I stayed at the Fairfield Inn for one night last week. The pool and breakfast areas are certainly beautiful. The older rooms, which I was told were \"gutted and redone\", are still lacking. The door jamb was missing on the first room we were in so the noise from street traffic was unbelievable. The staff were very kind and moved us to a room toward the back. The noise from traffic was less but, the noise from the air conditioner kept us up most of the night. Try to get a suite in the new section of the hotel if booking at this location. Review #30:This Feb of 2008 my wife and I stayed with the Marriot Fairfield Inn and Suites. We had a wonderful time! Checking in was a breeze with the very courtious and respectful staff assisting us with our bags and the introduction to the islands offerings. The staff were able to help us with our planning of trips throughout the three days we stayed, they assisted us with our transportation needs, sunset cruises, and most importantly our resturant choices. Getting around the island, we though would be troublesome, but the staff told us about the new scooter and bike rental company on property, directly next to the pool. We stopped in at the rental place called AHI Rentals and found the rates to be very pleasing to our wallets, we rented two scooters and never had to pay for a cab or any type of parking during our whole trip (saved us so much money and time) The hotel has a wonderful breakfast for a limited selection, jimmy dean sandwiches, bagels, coffee and juices, fruits and cereals. Oh, and the pool! such a wonderful and enjoyable area around the compound. We found the rooms to be very cozy, the beds were comfortable for being away from our own bed at home, and the housekeeping cleaned everything. Checking out was also a so very simple. Under our door was our bill early in the morning. We did not even have to step into the lobby before leaving. High recommendation for the hotel and staff! Thank you very much Review #31:I work for a different hotel chain and have pretty high standards! I could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Fairfield Inn & Suites Key West! The service was wonderful. The lady who was at the front desk most of the time (she was from Hungry) remembered us and was awsome! She accomodated all of our requests. Our room was wonderful. The pool was always great, clean and relaxed. Pete was was always at the Tiki bar to help us out. On our 1st night he recognized that we were \"new\" and asked for our ID\"s ... after that, he knew us by face! The breakfast was adequate and service still great as well! We did have to take a Taxi from the hotel to downtown, however met some great people with wonderful info as a result (Hi Ben from Israel!!). All in all I'd stay here again and give this hotel 2 thumbs up!! Great job! ! Review #32:Almost all of Key West's lodgings are overpriced, so paying $137/night (including taxes) for an average motel/hotel room at the roadside Fairfield is not too bad. But the slightly worn-out rooms are not even as large as at a typical Best Western -- they also lack closets, and the furniture in ours was pretty rickety. Not many electrical outlets either. On the plus side, wi-fi, breakfast and parking are all free. The staff are really A+. From the friendly check-in clerks to the efficient housekeeping and maintenance, everyone who works here seems to genuinely care about guests enjoying their stay. Hurrah! Review #33:The Fairfield was overall a great hotel. I wish it was closer to all of the main attractions like Duval Street or the beaches. It got pricy to take cabs everywhere. The rooms are a bit small so definitely get a suite if you have more than 2 people. The pool area and tiki bar are fabulous with drink specials everyday. They have a nice business center in the lobby. The hallways are all outside and the rooms are detached from the lobby so the elevator was kind of far to drag the luggage to. I would stay here again only if I was looking to only relax by a pool. If you want to go to a beach or enjoy the nightlife, definitely stay somewhere closer to those areas. Review #34:What a fantastic staff. Don & Lindsey were life savers along with Jeff Emmett. My daughters trip would have been ruined not to mention in an unsafe situation if these folks had not gone out of their way to help me. I will always be grateful. Review #35:I really cant say too much about this place other than it is average. I think its easier to do a review in list format: Pro: -Reasonably priced - we paid $159 (without tax) on Jan 2, compared to $3-400 for the rest of Key West -Our check-in staff Andrea was super great and helpful. -Decent location - on the main highway right next to plenty of shopping. 5 minute drive to anywhere in Key West. Is right across from the harbor, so can walk across the highway and have a nice place to sit and watch. -Nice heated pool Neutral: -Breakfast was decent. Typical Fairfield Inn breakfast (however, gotta complain about the plates being so small - can you please supply plates that are at least the size of the waffles?) -Hotel is painted nicely. However, it really shows its age. Con: -Rooms are tiny! We stayed in a King Suite and the bedroom had little room for our luggage. We put the luggage in the living room\" to be able to walk around the bedroom. -Mattresses are horrible! They are probably 10 years old? Every time my wife or I would move on the bed, it would squeak loudly. -Staff outside of lobby are not overly friendly. Seem too much in a hurry to even return my hello... -Seriously, can you please provide coffee throughout the day? Your staff is tired of coming up with excuses on why some days you have coffee in the lobby and others you dont. Im sure its a cost cutting measure, and some staff do go out of their way to help more than others, but get rid of the coffee makers in the room if that will bring back 24 hour coffee in the lobby. I would recommend this hotel to anyone mainly due to the value. If you have money to burn, stay closer to Duval Street. There are several nice inns down there, but they are pricey! Review #36:we arrived late in the evening and had problems finding a room... Mariott was fully booked but for one king... and Courtyard had no vacancy... so we checked in into a 2 queen family room. High season and high demand probably and being in Key West justified the 200 USD. Rooms off the mainroad are alright, but the AC noise is unbearable.. Negative: No wardrobe, a couple of hangers in the corner next to the washingbasin Negative: Curtain next to washbasin is merely hiding the pseudowardrobe and cannot be drwan, so no privacy. Negative: Room to small if suitcases have to lay, stand about the room. Difficult: Not well postsigned and difficult to find, evenings or nights Breakfast was included, basic but ok. We did not use pool, so no comment. Positive: Staff very friendly and helpful, no matter what time of day or night Positive: Free use of Computers in Lobby Positive: Nice Lobby Positive: Plenty of breakfast tables in the shade or in the open sun Review #37:-Visibility/Recognition from road needs to be better. Fairfiled sign in between 2 palm trees - I saw it the day I left. Another sign was obstructed by current construction items. I drove by twice looking for the motel. -Pool Area is beautiful. -Tables for breakfast needed to be wiped off initially and between uses - black film on the table i sat at -My room floor had a black film on surface. When I got in bed my feet bottoms were black. I took a tissue and wiped the floor - black. I asked the desk clerk the next morjning to be sure my room floor was mopped. It was. -Other than the floor, my room was fine. -Staff was helpful. accomodating and delightful. -Good location-, good access. Review #38:I travel to Key West regularly for work and always stay at the Fairfield Inn. It's a great hotel....good location, decent-sized rooms, delicious breakfast and an amazing staff. Nick, the sales manager, always tries to get me the best rates. In addition, everyone at the front desk is always helpful and there to greet you with a smile, especially Beata - she is extremely helpful and was able to quickly resolve booking issues i had the last time i checked-in. I totally recommend this hotel when you are in Key West either for business or pleasure! Review #39:Stayed for one night on a drop in and was a little shocked at the size and quality of the rooms. Marriott is my preferred chain and never disappoints... except this time. Nice friendly staff all around and good service. Nice grounds and decent pool. We did find ants around the sink in room 111 which was off putting. I wouldn't have minded sharing the room with them if we had had a bit more space. First time I have stayed at a Marriott that was so small and dated. Review #40:We took a 2 night 3 day vacation and stayed at the Fairfield Inn in January 2012. We travel a lot and really were impressed with how friendly the staff was and how bright and clean the property was. The pool was big with a lot of lounge chairs. This continental breakfast was amazing with so many wonderful choices . We especially enjoyed the healthy options of fresh fruit,yogurt,and hard boiled eggs. Review #41:We had an excellent experience at your Key West location. The staff was superb especially Olivia who provided the absolute best locations on the island to have great food and drink. This included helping us with reservations on a sunset cruise that we will remember for a life time. This was a long awaited vacation and even with the rain we had for the first 4 days we had an excellent time with the help of your friendly and curteous staff. They kept us smiling throughout. Review #42:Picked the Fairfield Inn mainly for their reputation and the rate. Turned out that it's about 2 miles from most of the downtown attractions (Duval St.). There are several buildings that make-up the property. The front buildings seem new, but the back two buildings have the look of an old 1950's motel that has been repainted and remodeled. We stayed in a room in one of these buildings -- very small room. I mean VERY small. However, it was clean. The \"courtyard\" pool was also nice, and seemed new. The \"tiki bar\" left something to be desired -- especially the bartender. He seemed a little bothered most of the time, and didn't seem to enjoy his position. Would've also been nice to have a waitress circling the pool, taking drink orders. Parking was OK at the hotel, but it's lack of proximity to Duval St. meant driving downtown and paying at least $10 per night to park there. Breakfast was normal Fairfield Inn fare. Price was right -- just nothing special about it. Not a bad place to stay though, even with some of the issues mentioned here. Review #43:I've been at all three of the Key West Marriott Hotels and this is my favorite for value and relaxation. Has a great relaxing pool layout, full continental+ breakfast and on this last visit a staff which worked harder than most travel agents finding some last minute activities and making the bookings for our family. Review #44:The hotel and staff were perfect for our weekend getaway. It was quiet, charming. We were celebrating my 50th birthday. We loved Key West. Great place to get away and have fun! The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our room was perfect and clean. Nice comfortable bed and amenities! We will definetely stay at the Fairfield Inn when we return to Key West! Review #45:We choose the Fairfield Inn for our stay because it was a lower price than the Duval street hotels. While the hotel is not new - (the room was small)- it has been renovated. Our room was clean, the bathroom was clean. The hotel lobby was nice and bright. The pool was beautiful and heated. Each morning the continental breakfast had cereal, muffins, fruit, breakfast sandwiches you could heat and the make your own waffles. The staff was friendly and accommodating. My only disappointment was that our room did not have a small refrigerator. After eating so many wonderful meals it was sad not to be able to take a go box. Also their bar closed at 7 pm. I was pleasantly surprised that we felt safe walking to Duval street and back later in the evening. Be aware that it is a full two mile walk- 1/2 hour at a good clip. There are scooters and bikes to rent at the hotel. Review #46:The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. We had a one bedroom suite which was sufficiently roomy. The bed and the sofa both rated about 5 on a 1 to 10 comfort index. Bathroom was spacious. Internet service was excellent. The room and the property were clean and the pool area is very attractive. Parking is free with some covered parking. The free breakfast is typical Fairfield and is served in an open patio area. This hotel is not within easy walking distance of any restaurants or attractions. Review #47:Very nice property however the pictures on the website was a bit misleading as it gave the impression that the King Suite was much larger than the actual size. We got an end unit which the view from the suite was the concrete wall of the walk way.even when you open the shutters the lighting was poor. The manager Chris, should take a refresher course in guest relations as he was not very tactful in advising me at check that there was no AARP /AAA or Travel Agents rate available. He chose to yell this out very loudly in his response and within ear shot of the other guest who were waiting to check in. He also barked at me that the hotel was FULL. As a Marriott member and a Guest I was really appalled by his demeanor and tone. I will continue to book other hotels in the Marriott chain however not this location. Review #48:Over the last couple years the maintenance and cleaning crew has been slacking. The pool area used to be pristine, now the paver stones are dirty and downright ugly. The landscaping is not being maintained. It is overgrown is some places, dead in others. The outside of the buildings have mold and mildew on them. It needs a good cleaning, which in FL all buildings require a couple times per year. It is a smoke free hotel, but guests tend to sneak smokes in stairwells and in the under building parking, staff does not police this. The interior of the rooms is getting worn down, need a remodel. Overall they keep them up fairly well, some mold and mildew in the shower stalls, the floors are clean, as well as the bathroom counters, sink and toilets. Towels have gotten downright cheap, used to be thin, now they are almost see through. The free breakfast is a plus, especially the staff that works to provide it, they are always helpful and keep the area as clean as they can. Review #49:After we checked in we went to rent scooters from the onsite rental agent (separate business from the hotel). When we went to pay for the deposit on the scooter, to our amazement, our Debit card was declined. This only happens when our spending limit is increased for the day or more obvious we are out of money. Neither of these should have been the case because our room was prepaid months ago. So we had to pay $200 in cash for the deposit on the scooter. Upon further investigation the hotel mistaking charged us again for the hotel stay. We informed them of their error and they said they would credit the card. The problem is now our card is locked and we are left only with cash. I spent an outrageous amount of time talking to both the Hotel and my bank to clear up this error. It was not the way I wanted to spend the first day of my vacation. I talked to 4-5 people at the hotel and 2-3 people at my bank before it was finally resolved. VERY AGGRAVATING. 6 HOUR ORDEAL. The other very aggravating issue was the location of the ice machine. There is only one for the entire complex. It is located in the far back corner above the parking garage. It can only be accessed by stairs unless you are lucky enough to be located on the far wing of the complex. It's mind boggling that the Marriott would have only one ice machine for a complex of this size. The Hotel is located on a very busy, fast moving street that is noisy all time of the day and night. The pool area is very nice and large with several water features. The bar is located very close and is also nice. The shower was large and had very good water pressure. The hot water was nice and hot. Only one mirror in the room. This became a major inconvenience when we tried to get ready go in the A.M and P.M. The grounds were clean and well maintained. I would not return here. Review #50:We chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced and was walking distance to the marina we were going out of for Kiteboarding lessons every day. It is about a mile north of most of the main attractions and beaches of Key West. Conveniently there are bikes available to rent on site at a good rate. The breakfast in the morning is very nice: Good selection, great environment by the pool, complementary newspaper, and amazingly friendly staff. The pool area is very nice. Free WiFi. Restaurants, drug stores, and grocery stores are within walking distance. If you are looking for the Key West experience and are on a budget this is perfect. Definitely get what you pay for! Review #51:Spent the night here in Feb 2010. The hotel was what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect to find at other Fairfield Inns. Parking/check in/pool all were fine. Continental breakfast was standard. Suite for 4 people was adequate. We had a king size bed which was nice. The kids used the fold out in a separate room (with TV). Water pressure was good. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear the highway from out location behind the pool. All tourist attractions in Key West are a good 10 min drive from the Fairfield. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ok with that then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine place to stay. A few days here would be good here but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down for a week, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d look for a place with more amenities. Review #52:I love the laid back feel of the Keys! I have stayed in this hotel once before and loved it. So when I decided to plan a friends get together, I thought that the Fairfield in Key West was perfect. The staff is so hospitable, and the hotel was very reasonably priced and a good location. We had a good time at the pool and the bar is great. Everything was perfect, especially the yummy breakfast...I can't wait to go back next year! Review #53:Like others have said, the room is small, but for two normal size people, it's fine. Not recommended if you are 250 pounds + and require major room just to move around. My guess is that the people who make comments about the size of the hotel rooms are carrying a few extra pounds. The bathroom was very nice, very updated. In fact, the bathroom and shower are the nicest part of the room. If you are wondering about the walk to Duval Street, it does take some time. My friend and I are pretty fast walkers and in shape, but it probably took us @ 40 minutes to get down there. Don't walk all the way down Hwy 1 to Duval. Start on Hwy 1 then take a right on Palm Avenue then follow Eaton Street. It ends on Duval where all the action is. It's a big difference in time. But even this \"angle\" was still 40 minutes. Ask the hotel staff if unclear. Review #54:Being a Platinum Rewards member gets you 200 points at checkin, and that is it. We just came from Doral to visit for a few days in Key West, the other Marriotts here were sold out... courtyard and beachside. The reviews from earlier on the location and staff had me optimistic that there might be bright lights. Yes, the staff are welcoming. No upgrades here due to high occupancy in winter. Basic rooms, no frills. Bring your own soaps n shampoo is you are expecting high end products. This is not the Napa Fairfield if you have ben there, you know what I mean. No no, this is much more basic. We paid $187/night, free parking, free wifi, second floor in building with no elevators, view of pool king bed and pull out sofa. No patio. Free breakfast, Marriott inn usual. Sink could use renovation. Glass shower with tile. Atleast tv was flat panel. Sofa needs to be thrown out. Mattress needs to be replaced. It is a basic fairfield inn. The price is standard for winter in Key west. There is laundry and bike rentals on site. The staff here try their best to do what thy can with what there is. If you need perks and newer accomodations, this is not it. It is the Keys, go have a drink and relax. Review #55:We really liked this hotel, nice swimming-pool area, very nice staff !! The only complain it's the noise of the street (Rosevelt Blvd), very noisy at night ! but anyway not a fault from the hotel. Free parking, no hidden extra charge, they gave us a second cocktail for free at the swimming-pool bar. The breakfast was simple but quality was there, you can make yourself some waffles. Review #56:I am lifetime platinum with Marriott and booked my room on reward points. The hotel has a lot going for it. Great staff....one of the friendliest and most helpful anywhere. There's also a large, clean, pool situated in very inviting surroundings. Another plus is an above-average complimentary breakfast buffet served poolside. In the afternoon, the breakfast area adjoining turns into a fun and friendly Tiki Bar....also very nice. Location is about a 5-10 minute drive from Duval Street shopping, dining, and nightlife. (Cabs are fairly plentiful and relatively cheap), The only problem here during my stay was the room. Clean, bright, and equipped with comfy bedding, but very small. We had three people (me, wife, and young adult son), and we kept bumping into each other. Very little storage space for luggage, etc. I did notice that they had what appeared to be larger rooms and suites. So my advice would be to book one of those (and expect to pay a little more), unless you're traveling solo, not planning spending time in the room (this IS Key West), or otherwise don't mind having limited space. Review #57:This place has clean, well maintained small rooms and a fabulous pool. They have a decent free breakfast each morning too. Unless you like a good 40 minute walk downtown you probably want to drive or get a cab to Duval or the marina. We did the walk and it wasn't bad at all; even in the heat. This is a solid choice and I would definitely go back again. Nothing fancy, but clean, and a great pool. What else do you need in Key West? Review #58:I must say, almost as great as the comforts of your own home. Being that this was my first time to The Keys, I thought I would be disappointed not being right there in the center of all the action on Duval Street. Wow, I'm glad I wasn't in the middle of the action. If I choose to go back to The Keys, Fairfield Inn would be my choice of hotel. Review #59:If you book rooms at name brand hotels because you don't want surprises when you arrive, look somewhere else. Although the main building appears to be relatively new construction - as you might expect if you've stayed in Fairfield Inns in the past - most of the rooms here are in much older buildings that had obviously been built long before Marriott took over. Although the room was clean, it was extremely small and not very well appointed. The pool area was nice but the parking area (most of it under the guest rooms on the exposed first floor) filled up quickly. Everything had a new coat of paint, but the place just had a tired, run-down feel to it. I will say, the staff were wonderful and because of them I have to give the hotel an overall \"Average\" rating. If this hotel was on a small Caribbean island it would be a gem, but in Key West I think I could have done better. Review #60:This hotel had one handicap parking spot out front, and only one entrance with a ramp to the rooms/pool area. To make someone in a wheelchair go from one end of the resort to another in order to reach a ramp is just not acceptable these days. I paid $60 more at this hotel than my hotel on Duval Street which offered an amazing cooked to order breakfast and great accessibility. The breakfast was far from good at Fairfield, and the workers were annoying trying to sell excurisions. I will definitely plan in advance to not have to stay with Fairfield again. Review #61:We chose this location because we were trying to stay out of the excitement, as we had our kids with us. The hotel is about two miles from Duval Street and the sunset at Mallory Square, which is a very easy ride. The facility was very nice, especially as compared to other Fairfield Inns. The pool was beautiful, with nice fountains and a great outdoor bar, and the bartender Mike was a super guy. The lobby was very classy, and the free breakfast offered more choices than most similar places. The rooms looked fresh and were clean. We actually used Marriott points for this one - so the room was free, and I'm not sure what the price would have been. We did not do it, but I would have felt safe leaving the kids in the room and hitting the town for a few hours at night time. Review #62:warm welcome;great poolside bar, great pool;nice room, clean everything; nice free breakfst buffett poolside; and the bonus not expected? They have Moped rental at the activity desk, and Mopeds on hand and ready to go. We got 2 and they were nice, new, and pretty reasonable. Review #63:VERY SMALL room: not up to marriott standards. Had to cahnge rooms because the ceiling was falling down, hair in the towels, and a large wad of hair in the room hair dryer. The shower had mol d spots in the ceiling and the shower tile was so slippery that it was a hazard to take a shower, must have used VERY unskilled labor as the sharp corners of the tile proturded in the shower and tile that was away from the wall and no grouted was full of gunk. Extremely disappointed in the room, although the help was very nice as was the outdoor area. Review #64:This hotel was not far from downtown and activities - about two km from Duval Street. Pool and room were beautiful. The bed was very comfortable. Continental breakfast was very good. Staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was next to US, which made it quite noisy at times. I would definitely stay at the Fairfield again and recommend it as well. Review #65:My boyfriend and I chose to stay here for his brothers wedding this past weekend. The main reason is because we got a free night with points. We stayed four nights in a king room. It was nice but we were a little disappointed because the room was a lot smaller than we thought it was going to be. I recommend upgrading to the king suite to give yourself more room. The shower was really nice and the room was clean. The bed was comfortable also. We also very much enjoyed the pool. Big, clean, and cheap drinks from the tiki bar. The major downside was that it was so loud every morning and hard to sleep in. We heard the same noises every morning. Housekeeping going up and down the hallway and banging around and the roosters around constantly crowing. The AC in our room was very loud as well. I'm not sure if I would stay here again but would recommend it if noises don't bother you. Review #66:Great hotel, great location, nice and quite. Our room was small but even with that, the room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel pool was very nice - I don't think I have ever seen a Fairfield Inn with a pool that large and fancy. The free breakfast was excellent and a great bargin. Also, the staff was outstanding... very friendly and helpful with everything (from check-in to local sights). We would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend this hotel. Review #67:we stayed at this hotel Nov 4-6th and had no problems. From the time I walked into the Lobby (greeted with a cup of juice) to the time of checkout the staff was friendly, helpful and always smiling. The continental breakfasts here were wonderful. Huge variety of choices and fresh selections. Pool area was great for our family (traveling with 5 year old and 2 year old). Room was huge but it was big enough and very clean and comfortable. We had a room away from the street so I can't complain about noise. Honestly for the money this was a fantastic hotel and would definitely recommend and choose it again in the future. If you are looking to be on Duval street you need to drive or taxi cab. However, we had children so it wasn't our top priority to stay out late and be in the heart of the action. Review #68:We usually do not like to stay any hotel having doors opened to outside. We did not realize it until we got over there. But we decided to give it a try. The staff was very nice, and updated our room to 2-room suite for free. Free Internet and free breakfast were also available. The tour bus stops in front of the hotel, and you may ask the receptionist for more information. She also helped us to book tickets to Dry Tortugas National park. The pool is a very beautiful one. Review #69:far from duval street and no free shuttle despite the marriot courtyard up the road providing one. pool is nice and breakfaast assortment was better than anticipated. i suspect we were in the older part of the hotel with a double room. it was clean but window opened to walkway so no privacy and room was tiny, no desk etc. we were originally going to stay 2 nights but at $359/night, no way. we were abe to get a special rate at the casa marina resort for $379/night with a $100 credit for resort acgtivities etc and it included a complete breakfast buffet. Maybe a studio suite at this hotel could barey justify their price but certainly not a room on par with a Days Inn Review #70:This hotel served a wonderful free hot and cold breakfast. Plenty of free parking, some covered. The pool is HUGE! The regular room was so small that our family of 4 could barely walk around. The regular room did NOT have micro or fridge. The beds were FULL, not queen, and there was barely room for the 2 beds. We are platinum elite with Marriott so we asked to be upgraded to a suite as soon as possible and 2 days later we got a suite for no charge. The suites were 2 room; large and spacious. A spacious living with a sleeper couch, fridge, microwave, table, 2 chairs, business desk, and desk chair. In addition there was a lounge chair and a coffee table. The TV was flat panel. There could have been more channels. In the bedroom, the beds were clean and comfortable but a little soft for my back. The bath was very small with a modern tiled shower- no tub. The bedroom is separated from the living by a glass, curtained, locking door. The windows did not open and did not have curtains. They did have nice shutters. Review #71:The hotel isn't located in the 'main strip' BUT it is within easy walking distance - a nice leisurely (and safe) walk (or if you're not inclined then a cheap taxi ride). The staff are great, even assisting in booking our day trip to Dry Tortugas (Fort Jefferson); a MUST do. Review #72:Room was clean, liked the separation of toilet/glass shower and the sink. Thank you! Breakfast was a pleasant surprise with lots of options. Pool area was nice with well-kept landscaping. Rent a bike (I recommend Eaton closer to downtown - they have lights) and enjoy the ride into town - cheaper than taxi's in the end and not too long of a ride. Be sure to have a light on your bike since it's illegal not to after dark. Review #73:Management and staff were very pleasant and helpful. However, the building is old, rooms are small and dark, A/C is too loud to keep on at night, walls are thin, walkways run along outside all the rooms hence much pedestrian noise, hotel is situated very close to highway US1 and thus noisy, room towels should have been replaced many years ago!!!! I would not stay here again. Review #74:Jimmy Buffett might have stayed here, and he would have easily found that lost shaker of salt in these very small (RV sized) rooms! So small that you could easily pole vault from the beds to the bath and back in a single attempt (I did not attempt it) The room had plantation shutters and no drapes so we enjoyed ambient LED lighting from outside all night. In the finest highway gas station rest room tradition the sink had neglected to have a drain stopper, a bow to water conservation or whatever, The toilet had an interesting sign on the lid proudly proclaiming its inefficiency with high contents. All this for ONLY $279 per night!. Staff were great, however. Breakfast good as well. Think small, stay here! Review #75:Great service, very nice rooms, (outdoor entrance to rooms) beautiful & very large pool surrounded by palm trees & shrubs so it's somewhat secluded from view. Very nice breakfast next to the pool. Only down side is it's located on a very busy/noisy highway ( the main highway in & out of Key West) & is about 2 miles from downtown Key West. I think almost all of the rooms are set back off the highway far enough to keep the noise to a minimum & also the rooms have a continuos fan option on the air conditoning system to muffle any highway noise. A good choice would be a room set back as far as possible from the highway but still overlooking the pool. The Old Town Trolley is the way to go to get downtown. They stop every half-hour at The Fairfield & 11 other stops on the island between 9am & 4:30 pm. It costs about $29.00. (It was good for 2 days which may have been a special being offered while I was there.) You'll need to take a cab back to the hotel after trolley is done for the day (about $11.00) There is a grocery store & shopping center within walking distance. Overall a great hotel to stay at if you don't mind being 2 miles from downtown. Review #76:I've stayed at the Fairfield previously and booked this trip for a retirement celebration with a family member. The staff made us feel like we were staying in a private home. They could not have been friendlier. Many staff members are from other countries but speak beauftiful english and told us charming stories of their countries. It was quite interesting. They told us they appreciated us speaking to them because it helped them learn about our country as well. Our car stayed parked at the Inn and we took local transportation to downtown Key West so we didn't have the hassle and worry of parking our car or driving in \"season\" traffic. The best way to travel. We could have rented bikes, but we took buses and taxis - cheap! GO! You'll love every minute! Review #77:Don't understand rationale for Fairfield Inn custom of NOT placing water cups in the same room as the water tap! One arrives at room thirsty, finds a water tap in the bathroom but then finds that he/she needs to try to cup hands together to have a simple drink of water! Frustrated, the still thirsty traveler now starts a 'where are the cups\" hunt? Is there some logical reason why water cups should not be placed in the same room as the water source? Also puzzled at Fairfield's practice of NOT putting water cups in the same room as the water tap? The thirsty traveler arrives at the hotel, finds the water tap in the bathroom. but no cups!? The immediate alternative is to cup hands to drink! Or leave the bathroom and embark on a cup search elsewhere in the apartment! I am at a loss to guess the reason for thus incovenient strategy ?? ? Review #78:While in Key West we prefer to stay at B&Bs near downtown, the Fairfield Inn & Suites is an acceptable alternative despite being more than two miles from Duval Street. My wife and I stayed there for three nights smack during high-priced, high-tourist season. The cost, however, was reasonable given the season. While Fairfields are in many respects average hotels, what sets this one apart is the knowledgeable, friendly staff. For instance, their recommendations of restaurants and attractions were terrific. They were most accommodating in every respect. In fact, they sought out their guests to be sure they were comfortable and had everything they needed. Our room was small but clean and stocked with all the amenities we would need. The AC was noisy when it came on. The pool area was of a quality one would expect at a four-star hotel. The outside bar and adjacent continental breakfast area spacious. All in all, if we couldn't be closer to the action downtown, the Fairfield did nicely. Review #79:We drove in looking for a room with no reservation on christmas eve.a lil pricier then I wanted but was worth it! Great pool and tiki bar.excellent continental breakfast.staff was accommodating and patient with my kids.doesn't look like anything from the front but a great place to stay.it is away from the square though.but was still worth it! Review #80:first of all. hotel prices are high in Key West in general. You can compare it to New York. The location of this hotel is next to the main road and that causes a considerable amount of noise. Staff was generally friendly despite the fact that the manager started an argument with us in the lobby. for our part the whole thing with giving out discount coupons for places to drink (buy one drink, get one for free) reminded us of party-charter-tourism to Ibiza, and takes away the exotic experinence of going to Key West. It underlined that if you want to see something enjoyable in Key West you better be drunk, which is not the fact at all. Key West is a place to visit no doubt. Lots of stuff to do, and plenty of amazing restaurants offering high class seafood. The restaurant neither had a lactose nor a gluten free selection of food, and the breakfast reminded me of prior experiences at Holiday Express or Days Inn. There are plenty of hotels in Key West. This one would definitely not be my 1st choice for my next stay. Review #81:Small rooms with extremely comfortable beds. Plenty of towels and the room was clean. Good free breakfast with plenty of selections. Free parking in the hotel yard. I can recommend staying here but remember it is pretty far from all the action in central Key West. You will need a car to go to the bach and downtown or take a taxiwherever you go. Not so many things within walking distance except for some shops and restaurants (like Friday\u00c2\u00b4s). One thing I did not like; We stayed on the 2nd floor. The railings had a note attached \"Please do not lean on railing\" and I felt like the railing could fall down any minute! This made me feel a bit unsafe when walking there with my 2 year old daughter. However I still feel I can recommed this hotel, staff was helpful and rooms comfortable. Review #82:Friendly, helpful staff and nice clean rooms that include amenities like walk-in showers & mini-fridges plus the bed was extra comfy. Had a room that faced US 1 and it was a bit noisy, but not to the point of annoyance and it did not disturb our sleep. Lack of elevator in our wing made lugging the suitcases up and down the stairs a chore. This was only an inconvenience not worth getting upset over as the staff was more than willing to help. Breakfast included in the room and it was the typical \"Continental\" fare served in most hotels in the Fairfield class. The hotel's General Manager was on hand to greet guests and make sure they were taken well care of which was a nice touch. All-in-all, a very good value compared to the closer-in but much pricier alternatives. I would stay again. Review #83:My husband and I stayed here for 5 days while vacationing in Key West. The room was really clean and well stocked. The pool is absolutely amazing, almost like you were staying at a resort. There were only two things I would change. The first thing is I would have loved a hot tub. The second thing, which was not the fault of the hotel, were the random roosters that wandered outside, making all kinds of noises in the early morning hours. However, the beautiful tiling and awesome bathroom made up for those two things! We will definitely stay here again! Review #84:Despite reading other reviews stating that the rooms were very small, we booked a suite for our 3 day stay in Key West. The property is off the beaten track and easily located. Our first impression was that we were not going to enjoy the Fairfield Inn. However, the building where you checkin was very nice and the desk clerks very helpful. The pool was very nice and the lobby inviting, so we figured that we would be OK. We were assigned a suite on the first floor. However, the first floor requires stairs/elevator--not good for persons with physical impairments. The Fairfield Inn has exterior corridors, which presents safety issues. Upon entering the unit, we were shocked at the cavelike atmosphere. Not only was the \"suite\" extremely small, but with very low ceilings and little light, it had a claustrophobic feeling. The bedroom was decent sized, with tile floors and a king bed. The bathroom was huge--especially considering how small the room was. The pie shaped \" living room\" had a sleeper sofa and built in refrig/microwave. The problem with this arrangement is safety. Not only is the sleeper sofa near the entrance, but right above it is a window on the exterior corridor, making it easy for child snatching . Also of concern is a fire issue---with the sleeper sofa opened, there is no way to walk around it in the event of a fire. Because of the safety issues, we checked out of the Fairfiled Inn . The desk clerk, Kelly, was very understanding and gracious and offered to move us. But because all of the rooms had exterior entrances, we chose to decline her offer. Review #85:For my first trip to Key West we decided to stay at the Fairfield Inn and Suites - I was extremely disappointed in the rooms. I thought that they were exceptionally small. Our room was located near the elevator and we were kept awake most of the first night of our stay by everyone returning from the bar in the middle of the night. The next day we did relocate to a room along the back of the hotel - so our view was only of the parking lot but at least it was quiet. Pool area was great as was the breakfast but by Marriott standards - this was certaintly not a category 5 hotel. My next trip back to Key West in April was definitely not spent at the Fairfield. Review #86:The Fairfield is a smart and well run hotel on the outskirts of Key West. It's easy to find on the main ring road into the City, but a little awkward due to there being a limited bus service and around 1.5miles from the main City centre. The Key West trolley tour makes a stop outside every 30min though, which is good if you're not into walking. Staff are very courteous and professional. Checking in and out a breeze. The lobby has free coffee (certain times only) and free internet. Free parking is also available to the rear of the hotel. Rooms are well appointed with large comfortable beds and a 'nautical' themed decor (to match the area you're staying in I guess!!). Air con was somewhat noisy and intrusive in both of our rooms, but worked well. The free breakfasts were ample and in a pleasant outdoor environment, and the pool deserves a mention as it's one of the best. All in all a pleasant hotel, a tad expensive and remote for the City, but fine for us. Review #87:The front desk people were very helpful and friendly. I liked that our room had a tile floor and not carpeting. The bed was very comfortable and even though we brought our own pillows, we didn't need them because the pillows they had were fine. We also had extra towels and got bigger towels for the pool. Breakfast was more than adequate and the pool area was very enjoyable. We were only sorry that the pool didn't have a hot tub too. Review #88:Our stay at the Fairfield was very pleasant. The front desk staff was very helpful and greeted us with sample strawberry daiquiris upon arrival. We were also given a handful of coupons for buy one get one free deals at local clubs and restaurants (mostly for drinks). They also gave us multiple phone numbers for taxi services and the bus schedule. The bus picks up right near the hotel. We were equipped with a map of Key West and the man at the desk was very kind to explain all of the different areas. The hotel also has a list of restaurant recommendations, which are staff favorites. Unfortunately the bus doesn't travel too late. We stayed in a two room suite that was very clean. The living room area was a tad small and the layout awkward, but it was alright. The master suite was very large with a huge comfortable bed with clean white sheets. The bathroom was also very clean. The continental breakfast was average - waffles, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, fruit, juice, hard boiled eggs, cereals are some of the items I remember. The pool area was very nice. The chairs were arranged to make you feel like you were at a private pool. There was a tiki bar (only open until 7 PM); the bartender wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too friendly. The Duval street is not far from the hotel, only a couple of minutes by car. I would not walk. There is also a many franchise restaurants and grocery stores nearby. We only paid $130 a night, so our room was a bargain! Review #89:Our stay at the Fairfield Inn in Key West was a very pleasant one. All of the attendants were so friendly and helpful. It was unfortunate that our stay could not have been longer, maybe next time and I certainly would consider staying at the Fairfield again. Thank you, Cheryl Hille Review #90:looking on the map this looks like a nice out of the way location. Wrong. It would seem that the road running along the front of the hotel is one of the main roads into Key West. First room seemed was not a suite as described when I booked it and you could put your fingers into the gap around the front door. There was so much road noise that there might as well have not been a front door. We immediately went back to reception and complained. We had to wait 15 mins but were then given a room on the first floor with a front door that did keep the noise out but was still traffic facing (maybe they keep the better rooms for families staying for more than 1 night).Tthe room was very nice and in a good state of repair. If you call a larger room with a double bed and a sofa bed a suite then you will not be disappointed. I do not so I was. The buffet breakfast was ok for free as long as you do not have high expectations and you don't mind sitting in an open covered area with only fans and no a/c (not so good as it was 89 degrees at 0800). You do sit along side a lovely pool though, one of the better features of this hotel. Also the free plentiful parking (some even under cover) is also one of the better features of the hotel. My suggestion, ask for a room at the back of the hotel and things will be fine. Review #91:When I called Fairfield Inn I was told the hotel was situated at the beach but in fact it was a mile away - very disappointing. Had I known that in advance I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have booked it. My second disappointment was the poor breakfast selection. Third - no gift shop. Fourth - unpleasant bike/scooter rental service. And finally, some of the stuff members were overly attentive. I would stay there again. Review #92:Overall really good hotel, good location, nice rooms even though they were missing some amenities in the rooms (no fridge for example). Even though I rarely use the pool when on vacation because I prefer touring the touristic locations, I have to say the pool area was very charming. You can take your breakfast by the pool which is surrounded by a lush tropical garden, making your experience very enjoyable. Staff was friendly, rooms were clean. The only negative might be the location. While it is nicely located in Key West (easy access - plus the island is small of course :), it is not by the beach if this is what you are looking for. Review #93:As I write this review, I am currently in a room in the hotel. Too much road noise and the loud AC have kept me awake so far. 1st impression was not good - even my 6 year old commented that the hotel looked like a red roof inn. 1st room got flooded - was shifted to another room. I am not impressed with this hotel at all. For the money that I paid (160$), I have stayed in far better marriotts in the past. My outlook of marriott has now changed and I will need to be very careful when I select a marriott in the future. I hope that the Sales Manager reads this review and offers me a nice complimentary something to make up for my stay. Review #94:I visit Key West once a month. I have stayed in a number of places on the island. This is the best value I have found. The rooms are nice. The location is close enough to the fun spots, yet far enough away that you can actually park your car at your own hotel. (For free and under cover) The staff has always been energetically friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. To keep it fair; the rooms are not brand new but they are clean and in good repair. The one thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like different is a restaurant within walking distance. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at those places and they are not as good a hotel. Review #95:I can't say enough about the staff at the Fairfield. The best customer service I've had in a long time! They were very helpful recommending restaurants and activities. They also have THE BEST POOL AND BAR, which is top priority for me, considering the poor beaches @KW. We rented a scooter right on the property, which is KEY! ONLY complaint...rooms could use a little update;) Review #96:I booked this 4 night February stay on Priceline and was awarded this hotel. I was happy to get it from previous reviews and they didnt disappoint. They are in a decent location with grocery and other stores nearby with a 5min bike ride to Duval street. Our room was a bit small but was spotless. The pool area and tiki bar while not spectacular did the job very well. The free Wifi at the hotel worked flawlessly. A big plus was the free parking and large selection for continental breakfast. The breakfast area had your basic fruits,cereals,Jimmy Dean breakfast items,juices/coffee,yogurts,waffles,USA Today newspaper and other items. There is a moped and bike rental kiosk onsite also. The from desk staff and other staff may have been the best Ive ever encountered. Kudos to Mirella(sp) I was hoping for the Casa Marina,Reach,Hyatt or Westin when I was bidding on Priceline. They didnt work out and I was given this gem. Thanks for a great stay. Review #97:We stayed in one of their suites and while the master bedroom was large, the second room with the pullout couch was not. Service was courteous and \"happy\". However, we had to call three times and deal with multiple visits from the staff before we received sheets and a bed cover for the pullout bed. The room windows are not darkened in any way. Lots of sunlight comes into it. Not good. Finally, the walls are paper thin, we could hear our next door neighbors and because all rooms face an outdoor walkway we would hear everyone that walked by. Review #98:My husband and I stayed here in June 2011 on a vacation trip to Key West- and found we made an excellent choice from among the many options available! The entire hotel is very clean and neat and our room (a King studio) was lovely, nicely decorated, and bright. The bed was comfortable and the private balcony overlooking the pool a nice plus. Bathroom was more spacious than most hotels of this type, and tile floors throughout the room were a welcome change from difficult to keep clean carpeting we've encountered at other places. Service from the staff was truly outstanding and always friendly! Everyone we encountered went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and to offer suggestions on how to best enjoy Key West! The pool is lovely (actually as nice as pictured on the hotel website!) with lots of seating available and features a poolside tiki hut that serves a daily reasonably priced drink special along with its regular full bar menu. A poolside limited buffet breakfast was included each morning; food was fresh and menu included a couple of non-standard items along with the typical cereal, fruit, and make-it-yourself waffles. The hotel is located about 2 miles from the \"downtown action\"- but the ease of free parking onsite and sight-seeing trolley that stops there frequently make up for that small inconvenience. This is an entirely nonsmoking hotel- something my husband and I especially appreciated! One drawback for some might be the lack of elevator to the second floor rooms in some areas of the hotel. Although there is no restaurant onsite there are numerous restaurants in the area from which to choose. Review #99:When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted with refreshments and big smiles from the staff. Throughout our visit, the staff was very attentive and very friendly. Breakfast bar was fantastic. The drive from the hotel to Mallory Square and Duval Street was about 5-7 minutes. Bicycle and/or scooter rental was available from the hotel. Rooms were nice and clean. Had a problem with the air conditioner, but service technician was there to correct problem within 5 minutes of calling the front desk. Couldn't ask for any better service.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "LLM"}

The bathrooms are mixed, some need cleaner doors and to be renovated, others seem clean and well appointed. The ice and vending machines are close. The coffee machine in the room is appreciated. The lighting was insufficient, and an old basement smell was present sometimes. While close to the airport, it was quiet because of thick windows.

It was great to have a comfortable bed and room on our final night of holidays. The kids loved the pool which was warmer than the ones at the resort in Cancun which we could not believe as we were in Seattle! The staff was friendly and we appreciated the cookies after a long flight when we were waiting to check inn. Just a nice touch! Shuttle was convenient and would definitely stay here again. Review #1:I reserved this room through an affiliate travel booking platform and got a great room rate. Aprox. 75.00 (not including taxes) for a full day stay. Late check in was effortless and was greeted with a warmed cookie. I think it is fair to mention it costs to use internet in your room but for business travlers I suppose that is an expected cost. Great friendly staff took the edge off our long day of intercontinental travel. I would choose this hotel again as our stop over. Review #2:We flew into SEA TAC for a few days before our cruise and our travel agent recommended this hotel. The hotel was clean, beds were fine, hotel is located across the street from the air port, was within walking distance to a Denny's, Jack in the Box, and a steak place. Room was ready very early in the morning for us. The kids liked the pool and I was able to do laundry before the cruise. It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over), and was next to an Enterprise car rental. Lots of conveniences close by. Downtown Seattle was about a 30 minute ride by light rail service (cost of $16 for the 4 of us) or $40 cab ride to the pier. Hope this helps. Review #3:This is a large hotel and I expected it to be large and impersonal. On the contrary. It has \"small hotel\" service, meaning that you don't feel lost and they treat you well. Several fireplaces and seating areas in the lobby make it comfortable. I had a reservation for a \"mountain view\" room. Initially, I had a view of the airport. I asked for a different room and was given a much better view on the other side of the main section of the hotel. Very nice pool area although in cool, rainy Seattle I didn't get a chance to swim. The food was good although a bit pricey. The service in both the casual restaurant at breakfast and the dining room in the evening was efficient. Spacious room and very comfortable bedding. The room to which I was initially assigned had a broken lamp and a rip in the carpet. The second room was nicer. Looks like they are trying to keep up with on-going updating and maintenance. I stayed here four nights for a conference and was actually pleasantly surprised by the overall hotel experience. Lots of airline personnel stay here as well. And yes, we like the chocolate chip cookies at check-in. Review #4:I stayed here on November 7-8, 2004. When I read the previous reviews, I asked if my reservation was for a wing or a tower room. It was for a wing room but the reservation staff courteously changed it to a tower room. Access to the tower is by external glass elevators. My room was large, quiet and had a small balcony. There was a stain on the carpet but otherwise it was clean and well maintained. The room was equipped with a coffee maker, iron & ironing board and blow dryer and there were 2 sinks - one inside the bathroom and one outside. The room did not have a refrigerator or microwave; the high speed internet connection in the room cost about $10. There is no complimentary breakfast; there is a coffee shop and an espresso bar that also sells yogurt, bagels and pastries. The hotel has a complimentary airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. I was attending a large conference held at the hotel. My co-workers with wing rooms said they were 'okay' and they heard some noise from neighboring rooms. The wing hallways had a damp smell. One wing building was closed for renovation. All staff were very courteous and helpful. For me the location worked well since I was attending events at the hotel and didn't have to rent a car to get there. If I had transportation and didn't have events at the hotel, I would look a few miles away for a better buy for the money. Review #5:We stayed at the Double Tree for two nights in July. The suite was spacious, clean, and quiet. Our room had two sinks,a flat screen TV, and two comfortable beds. Very conveinient for early morning flights. The hotel shuttle will drop you off at your destination as long as it's enroute to the airport. Overall,it was a very pleasant stay at a very nice property. I am very delighted that we stayed there!!!!!!!! ! Review #6:This is the best airport hotel we have stayed in, and we have stayed there twice. It has a convenient location and a shuttle service that runs every 15 minutes for 24 hours. We had a large room with a balcony, comfortable beds, an easy chair and ottoman, and a coffee maker - all things we don't always find. We ate supper in their restaurant and I had an excellent salad (large enough to divide) and an exceptionally good Reuben sandwich. There are also other choices, with several restaurants and fast food places within a very short walk. The staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed the warm, chocolate chip cookie we were given at check-in. Review #7:This hotel is the BEST at SeaTac! Valet parking was very quick and hassle free. Check In went very smooth, and we were upgraded to a very large suite at that time! The pool is very relaxing and big. Lounge is great! The rooms are very spacious and very nice. Beds are SO comfortable and the best sleep I have gotten at a hotel. Shuttle service is very quick and so great! They leave every 20 minutes on the hour. I have stayed at many hotels at the airport, and this one beats them all!!! Especially with the shuttle service. You can guarantee that we will be back soon, no doubt about it. Review #8:I had booked this hotel due to my previous terrific experience with a very nice room and bath. Upon arrival, I requested the same room as previously, if available. I was informed that entire floor was currently being re-furbished and there were no rooms of that quality available. He hoped re-furbishing would be complete in January. Interesting, as the beautiful room I stayed in previously was very new-gorgeous bath and soaking tub. I can't imagine those rooms would need refurbishing! I was then given another \"Hilton Honors\" room. I arrived to a room on the very ground floor that had a glass door that opened to the outside parking area. Due to security, I did not think this was a good idea for a single female traveler, however, I did not want to 'make waves' and request another room as I was only there for one night. Upon further inspection of the room, the older bathroom wood doors were dirty from years of use-these \"Hilton Honors\" rooms really need refurbishing. I had such a great experience the first time, I am disappointed-and-as a single female traveler, will never stay on the ground floor of any hotel again, if at all possible. Review #9:When you need a hotel near the Sea Tac Airport, stay at the Doubletree and ride their shuttle. The Drivers are very professional, courteous and make you feel like you are their only customer! If something might goes awry, the staff are quick to correct and aim to provide a memorable stay that makes you want to return. The quality of customer service should be an inservice for a number of their competitors. We have stayed at Hotels that are many times more expensive yet the staff are nowhere near as impressive as the Doubletree. The Wynn in Las Vegas should sign up for tutoring to learn how to treat customers. Perhaps then their vacancy rate would dwindle! Review #10:Stayed at this hotel beause the park n fly. Was an excellent choice, beautiful hotel and great beds made for a perfect start for vacation. Have stayed at cheaper hotels with park n fly and they are always scary! Pay the extra bucks for a top of line hotel with free cookies. Review #11:Despite the enormity of this hotel, it very much feels almost family run. The staff are exceptional and the quality without question. The hotel couldn't be better placed for flying out of Seattle. I won't hesitate to book here should my future travels involve a long leg from Seattle. Review #12:We stayed at this hotel for one night before starting our Princess landtour. The hotel reception had a lovely smell of freshly baked cookies which were given out at check in and were delicious. The room was spacious and had a coffee maker. There were 2 double beds and the mattresses were really comfortable. We had a lovely buffet breakfast in the restaurant and sat by the outdoor pool in the morning while we waited for our transfer to the airport. Review #13:My friend and I are both Hilton Honors members. We are currently staying here and prepaid for the room. What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless. On the incoming leg earlier, we stayed across the street at the Hampton for about the same price, wireless internet, free parking and free breakfast. Just doesn't make sense. Overall, the room is nice, but could have a refrigerator in it for the price. One thing I have learned about traveling is that to bring your own router just in case there isn't wireless. Especially when more than one person in the room has a computer. If I come back to Seattle, I'd go back to Hampton. Review #14:After reading the reviews here, my family was VERY disappointed with the hotel. First, the hotel is going through major renovations in the tower part of the hotel. We stayed in the village part of the hotel, which were found to be old and dark. The room was like staying in a basement, an old and mildew smell. The A/C put out hot air. We put the A/C on 60 and the room immediately heated the room up 89 degrees. I could not recommend this hotel. Review #15:We spent the night in this hotel our last evening in Seattle before an 8 a.m. flight. The area around the airport can be iffy, as in many large metropolitan areas. This hotel is clean, neat and offers good value for the money. We felt safe and secure with our small children. AND they have the famous Doubletree chocolate chip cookies! We were wiped out from a long day and wanted to stay in the room for the night and rest. We ordered clam chowder from the menu - much better than I expected - and finished off fruit from Pike Place Market. The hotel has seen its newer days: the carpets are threadbare in some spots and the cement balconies are noticeably empty of furniture. But the rooms are a great size, and we noticed large groups of flight attendants from various airlines staying there as well. The hotel employees were very polite and most efficient: we were on our way to our room within 30 seconds, warm cookies in hand. I went down to the lobby about 5:30 a.m. to print out our boarding passes, and a front desk employee came over to be sure everything was going well and I had what I needed - nice touch. Review #16:We flew into Seattle and arrived after midnight. After driving up and down International Bl. one time we decided on checking in at the Doubletree. All the other lodging options seemed to have dimly lit parking lots next to seedy businesses or something. It's an ok hotel by any other standards but nice compared to what's close by. Review #17:I booked a post-cruise package and the staff did not know how that worked. Hassle to get from ship to hotel, hassle to get correct rate, hassle with hotel safe (should have one in room anyway), and a hassle to get to the airport the next morning. They offer shuttle service (sporadically) and even though I was outside in plenty of time, at least 40 people showed up to try and get into a VAN. I took a taxi as everyone was trying to cram into the shuttle with no respect for first-come-first-served. Room service was good, however. Room was an \"upgrade\" but so far from the elevator. Would avoid this hotel in the future. Review #18:Physically, this is a very tired property. While renovations appear to be underway according to signs, the hotel infrastructure shows its age. Even where renovated, the hotel still needs work. My room, in the renovated tower, had very insufficient lighting and a bathroom that had seen better days. Provided amenities (e.g., soap, shampoo) were low quality. The tower elevators, which run on the exterior of the building, were quite cold. Staff wise, this hotel also needs renovation. Service in the more upscale of the two restaurants was almost unbearably slow and the food was cold when it finally arrived after over a hour at our table. Review #19:Decided to stay one night by the airport and used priceline to get a room and ended up with the doubletree at a good rate! The hotel is pretty big but the location next to the airport is great. I asked for a room in the tower and the room was spacious with a nice king bed and a balcony that overlooked the airport. The views of the airplanes taking off was great! There are a few restaurants around the hotel area and you can also easily walk to the airport should you want to. Review #20:this hotel was so comfortable. After commuting back and fort from florida if too tired to drive back to my destination i always stay at this dbl tree. I have never once had a bad nights sleep in these beds. I love the big warm cookies in the evening. They never seem to slap my hand if I grab 2 or 3...recommendation goes to this hotel over others! Review #21:We've stayed at the Doubletree Seatac four or five times in the past few years, and we've always enjoyed our visits. The hotel has a convenient airport shuttle that picks up guests on level 3 of the airport parking garage at stops #1 and 3. The shuttle runs 24 hours per day, and it makes about three trips per hour (no phone call or reservation is needed). If you don't want to wait, a good alternative is the nearby taxi stand; fare to the Doubletree should be less than $10 because of the hotel's proximity to the airport. On a recent trip, we landed at Seatac after midnight and were picked up within five minutes. The check-in process was courteous and smooth, and we were given a nice corner room with a balcony on the 9th floor (accompanied by the delicious chocolate chip cookies). Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed watching airplanes takeoff and land, and this hotel provides an eagle's eye view of the airport (unless you're on the east side of the tower, in which case you're stuck looking at the snowcapped Cascades and/or Mt Rainier). Despite its proximity to the airport, the room was surprisingly quiet. At 1am the lobby bar was still very active with a jovial but well-behaved crowd, although the bartenders were understandably ready to head home to their families. I was able to purchase a reasonably priced bottle of Oregon pinot noir for in-room consumption. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed. My wife really liked the Crabtree & Evelyn \"Citron\" toiletries; I liked the very comfortable bed and blackout curtains. Review #22:Spent 3 nights at conference at the hotel. The staff are wonderful! They are dedicated and helpful to your every need. Bed's in the room were the heavenly beds and I slept very well all 3 nights. Room was highly run down. Wall paper peeling off walls in different places, light bulb not replaced in room and carpet stained. Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted. Food was very expensive in restaurant and just okay. Burger, soda and tip $21.00. Save yourslf some money and eat off site. This is a hotel in the Hilton chain and I was disappointed.....:( Review #23:This hotel disappointed. As a Doubletree, I expected a GOOD three star property for my stay on August 27, 2004. What I found was rather run down and shabby. We were told we had a great view of the \"lake\" from our room. There was no lake visible. The bathroom was dirty and stained. Carpet was old as were the other furnishings. Coffee shop service was horrible. Waited forever to be seated and there were only 3 others in the place. Waitress never brought the items we requested and the order was askew. We had to go searching for our check to pay it. This Doubletree is very tired, and more like a 2 star property than a 3 star. It looks nice on the outside,, but inside it is very shabby and used. Review #24:This hotel was within a stone's throw of Sea-Tac airport and right next to the off-site Thrifty car rental lot, so for location, it was great. Unfortunately, there was nothing memorable about the hotel itself; it was a huge place, reminiscent of a rambling casino hotel (but without the lights or the casino), but just bland. The hotel restaurant was nice enough, but again, bland; the food was nicely presented but had no taste. The first night there I did not hear any airport noise, but the second night, I clearly heard the planes. I also used the business center, but the computers were slow and ran an old version of software; one printer worked but the other didn't. To sum up: Just nothing special, I'd rate this hotel as an average place. Review #25:We opted for the $5 requested upgrade for hhonours members, and the room was superb when we got it. At $65 plus the upgrade this was outstanding value, so much so we used it on our return journey too. Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it. Choice of food was excelent. Review #26:Stayed here after New Year's day and following day since we had tix to Seahawks game 01/02/11. We LIKED the fact that it was close to new rapid transit terminal which we chose to take to stadium. This plus we luv their complimentary cookies that they offer upon check-in. Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room. I had to trek all the way to the front-desk from out tower location (to have key re-coded) only to f ind it did not resolve issue. Frustrated - we called front desk - who called security - who called maintenance. They discovered faulty battery problem and reset. All of this resulted in out take-out food getting cold plus I lost my scarf somewhere along the way. Also, wished to have their shuttle drop us off @ transit terminal but we were told to wait - we decided to walk and it was rather cold. Saw shuttle pass us along the way ;-( Still, LIKE the location and the cookies ;-) Review #27:Across from Sea Tac Airport. Very big, spread out hotel with very reasonable rates and nice rooms, although some are a bit of a convoluted walk from reception. Lots of air crews use this hotel which has a frequent free shuttle to airport. We stay here and go to Seattle for Mariners games. The shuttle will drop you at the airport train station if you are going to Seattle, but on your way back you must walk from the station to the shuttle bus pick up area at the airport(about a 5 to 10 minute walk). Parking and some extras relatively expensive. We have stayed here a few times and keep coming back because it is good value for money. Review #28:Pros - Very close to airport, very quiet rooms (you cant hear the airplanes taking off even though it is right across from the airport), friendly staff, VERY comfortable beds with lots of pillows, large rooms, ice and vending machines close to all rooms, nicely appointed bathrooms, free shuttle (runs every 20 min, no reservation needed), convenience store on site, ATM, warm cookies on check in. Cons - Hotel is spread out so pay attention to how to get to your room as you may get lost, Feather pillows (synthetic available on request), Pay parking ($16 self/day $20 valet/day), warm cookies on check in. We have stayed at this hotel several times, and others in the area. It may cost a little more to stay here, but we feel it is worth it for the quiet rooms and the very comfortable beds. Review #29:OUR overall stay was great, would have been nice to have no feathered pillows , not having a MICROWAVE,REFRIDG not cool, they charge each day for a roll away bed they said they would accomumdate for up to five in one room stayed three days so used blankets on the floor for the two boys I requested four blanket but had to go down to argue after only getting one they charge for wi-fi in room, LOBBY FREE- charge for daily parking no continuial breakfast without charging all these should change I called on phone for the entertainment book checking in nope they dont take it close to many places to eat,bank and even small cascino the airport close yes somewhat noisy but hey what one is not only during day time night time very quiet staff quiet friendly HOUSEKEEPING WONDERFUL yes i would recommend this hotel to others it'sa nice place is great for summer as with pool only on outsde . Review #30:This is a good place to stay for a conference or if you need to stay for a night or two near the airport. The room was large and clean. I heard no noise from the airport, or elsewhere. The bed was VERY comfortable (a Serta mattress). This is a large property with (I believe) five buildings. Out the back of mine (#5) the deck looked out into a forest. The walk from that building to the lobby is about 2-3 minutes. Plenty of eating places nearby, and the bar in the hotel is fine also. You are charged for parking - $8/night for outdoor parking. Review #31:We spent one night here before flying out to Alaska. They have a good stay/fly program that we always use to leave our car there while on vacation. The room was clean and bed comfortable. My only complaint is that they charge for the use of wifi in your room. I can walk down to the lobby and get free wifi or use their computers for no charge. So why would I pay to use it in the room? ? Review #32:Very nice hotel, very close to the airport, walkable in fact to the terminals in less than 10 minutes or one can take a free shuttle bus. Check-in was friendly and quick, and one receives a nice warm chocolate chip cookie along with the room key. Large spacious lobby, clean comfortable rooms. Flat screen TV with many stations available. Internet available in the room for a fee or free wifi in lobby. There are also complimentary computers to use also. There is a stand alone kiosk which one may use to check in for flights. All major airlines are represented. Can not speak to the dining aspect of the hotel as I did not eat there. All in all, a nice place to stay before or after the flight. Review #33:I recently spent 4 nights here. The check-in was wonderful, the staff great, and the hotel itself was nice. The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers). And they add a $3 tip on top of the 18% (and then all the regular taxes are there, too). So a burger and soup were $32, and it was a very. VERY average burger. Total rip-off with the excess charges. I did not use daily housekeeping and was able to get what I needed when I saw them in the halls. And the women I met were very, very friendly and polite. But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected. I did email Rissa, who took a day and a half (and two emails) to respond to me. She said all the blahblahblah and offered to change rooms, but I was halfway through my stay and changing rooms is a pain. This was a business trip so I was not looking for compensation on the room. I thought she may care a bit more with the pics as proof, but I guess they hear complaints all day. I did make sure to include all the positive I had to say as well. The internet fees are a HUGE scam-- $12-$15 for 24 hours. There is no way that they aren't banking money here. Parking is another point of contention but I did not park so not really going worry about this one. Overall, if this were MY money, I would NOT stay here. With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room. They don't even have microwaves or fridges in the rooms. Even most motels give you a microwave. Review #34:The DoubleTree was convenient to the airport, even though we were part of group travel, the DoubleTree had an airport shuttle. This is a multi story well thought out hotel. There were elevators, gift shop, restaurant and lots of other dining choices just across the street. You could safely cross the street at the light and crosswalk and find your self at a diner or several other restaurants. The hotel staff was courteous and very helpful with our questions. Our room was large and very comfortable. Even though we were there for just one night we would recommend this hotel for multiple night say if you are visiting the Seattle, WA area. We cannot comment on the value, as our price was included in our group travel, so Iwe're sure it was a group or discounted rate. Review #35:Stayed at this property for one night with my family ( wife and 4 and 7 yr old) before a morning flight. Used the park and fly package. Valet was quick and received help with bags. Check in was very quick and was assigned a two queen room in the tower. Room was typical for a double tree. Decent size with flat panel TV, and normal size bathroom. Had a room that faced away from the airport so that helped with the noise. Slept ok, but the room was quiet. Service was great and bell person got ice for us and was very helpful. Check out was quick. Shuttle bus goes every 18 minutes and we walked out the front door just as one was leaving. Was hoping it would stop but it kept going (empty at that). At that point we waited the 18 minutes with 10 other people and caught the next bus. Return to the hotel was fine. Bus driver called for our car but it wasn't ready when we arrived. waited a few more minutes for valet to bring car back. Be sure to have your receipt for parking from the front desk (i did thanks to previous posts) or you won't be able to get your car. All in all a good airport property. Just be advised, this is a big conference service type hotel and they have many groups that use it....might not always be a quiet hotel, but for our trip it worked out great. Review #36:We left our car for 5 days and stayed in this Doubletree Hotel on our return,our shuttle arrived promptly and we were given a Tower Room . It was a huge room with great bedding,sheet count & pillows. We were pretty late 9.54pm but managed to get a decent meal in the bar, I will happily come back to this doubletrees. Only one hiccup when we were collecting our car through their valet ,the valet asked pretty abruptly as we $5 tipped him if we had settled our parking fee. Unfortunately I hope front desk could have better communication. Review #37:This is a pretty rundown hotel. We did not choose it. Our travel agent booked the hotel through a cruise company as part of a package deal. It was about fifteen minutes away from town and very close to the airport. We knew we would have to pay for parking overnight but were unaware of a parking tax on top of the regular fee. The service at the hotel coffee shop was really slow and the waiter seemed really bothered by having to come to our table to see what we wanted. The soup was brought to us pretty cold, but he seemed to vanish so we couldn't complain. Even Denny's would probably have been better. Review #38:Received a great deal on this hotel by bidding on Priceline. I didn't have a car so Airport, Light Rail and many restaurants are in walking distance. They do have an airport shuttle. The staff were very accomodating and I loved the chocolate chip cookie at check in. My room was clean and nice but seemed motel like away from the tower. Maybe I got the cheap seats being a priceline customer. Anyway, I requested a non-smoking room but the floor smelled like the stench of smoke. At least my room didn't reak otherwise I would of tried to change rooms. I just wish the smokers had their own wing. Other than that issue, the hotel is nice and staff was great. Review #39:We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied. The stay, park & fly packages are *usually* a good deal, and their airport shuttle service is fantastic - I believe it runs every 20 mins around the clock. Great for those early morning flights, and no worries about traffic jams as Seatac Airport is right across the street. Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out. The rooms are relatively spacious, our kids love the pool, and the breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get. Review #40:Very close to Seatac, we were tempted to walk there from the airport. In fact, the free shuttle probably spends more time driving back to the hotel than it would probably take to just walk back across the street. The hotel is clearly old but Hilton has gone to some lengths to make it feel more up-to-date. It's obviously clean, although the further you get into the maze of halls the more the funky smell of \"old\" permeates the air. We utilized the free airport shuttle, which is handy, but did not use any other hotel service. The room was fairly quiet when other guests weren't talking in the hall. The bed was quite comfortable and free of bed bugs. The neighborhood has mostly fast-food or 'greasy-spoon' joints except for a nice looking Thai restaurant across the street. We would certainly use this hotel again as our layover sleeping arrangement on our way to and from vacations. Review #41:We had the penthouse suite, 2 rooms with a kitchenette. The shuttle getting from the airport to the hotel was very croweded and hot (yes hot for Seattle) and smelled. We had planned to eat at the hotel restaurant but it was not open. So we had to order a pizza. Strange for such a large hotel not to have a restaurant or two. They told us to go across the street. They did have warm cookies at check-in. The room was done up in buttery soft yellows. The bathroom was huge. Larger then some hotel rooms I've stayed in. It had a sunken in tub, huge walk-in shower, robes & full line of Neutrogena beauty products. Two flat screen TV's-sitting room w/ leather sofa, tables and chairs. There was a huge wrap around balcony with a view of the glass elavators and a view of the Cascade Mts. The bed was so comfy I slept like a baby. The room was very sound prrof, as I did not hear anyone in the halls or other rooms. No b-fast was offered. The shuttle only runs on the hour, not every half an hour like you would assume from an airport hotel. So we almost missed our flight. By the time the shuttle was prepared to leave on the hour there were to many people to fit in the shuttle(they could have run there & back in that time ). The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad. If you are not using the airport shuttle this hotel is great. Review #42:We ended up at this hotel as our flight home was cancelled. We stayed near the airport at the beginning of our trip and stayed at the Cedarbrook Lodge as it was rated no 1 on Trip Advisor. This hotel is on a par in terms of service and room quality. Considering over a hundred people turned up at the same time due to the cancelled flight the check in was very quick. The staff went around the lines of people handing out the essentials of shaving foam, razors, toothpaste, toothbrushes and home made cookies as we didn't have our luggage which was checked into the cancelled flight. Room was enormous, with balcony and was spotlessly clean. Restaurant food was excellent and reasonably priced and breakfast was good. Shuttle service was very quick with plenty of buses on hand. The only issue we had was the size of the hotel with various wings that were difficult to navigate. A few more signs halfway down corridors would have helped. We got lost as did lots of people we met along the way! Don't let this put you off though. Review #43:This hotel embraces its role as an airport hotel and fufils its purpose very well. Staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are decent, and it's very close to the airport. The airport shuttle runs round the clock (every twenty minutes) and is very efficient. The hotel's extended parking option provides great value. Review #44:This place is huge - felt like I was in Disneyworld!! This is an older hotel that has gone through a recent renovation. Overall I was quite pleased as we paid only $50 through Priceline. Unfortunately there was no wifi and the parking was $16 per night - expensive for the area. Review #45:We have stayed at this hotel several times in the family suite ( 2 bedrooms/1 king and 2 queen beds). Love the warm chocolate chips cookies and the service has always been outstanding. Excellent morning breakfasts and the airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes but we have made the 10 minute walk numerous times to the airport terminal. Review #46:We live about two hours and a ferry ride from the airport and always stay here when we have an early morning flight. We get the stay and jet package so we park for a week for only $30.00. It is somewhat dated but comfortable enough and the shuttle is very reliable. Review #47:We really liked the Doubletree Sea-Tac. We stayed here the last night of our trip to Seattle (got it on Priceline for $46 - not bad!). The bed was very nice, room was clean, we even had a balcony. It wasn't loud at all from the airport but was loud from the hallway (which didn't bother us since we left by 5 am). They were extremely convenient to the airport. The staff people were really helpful and nice. Plus you get a free cookie at check-in! :) The only complaint is - parking for overnight cost $16, and on top of that, we had $1.40 of tax!!! I can see paying parking for a downtown hotel - but for a hotel at Sea-Tac it seemed absurd to have to pay parking. Overall it was still a reasonable deal though. I would stay again. Review #48:Overall this is a good property. Parts of the hotel are laid-out such that it can be difficult to find your room. My co-workers and I joke about the Doubletree Maze at SEATAC. It takes a few trips to figure it out. The hotel is very close to the airport and sometimes we walk. The van in the morning can be very crowded so get in line early. The coffee bar in the lobby is great and opens at 5. The rooms are comfortable and the cookies are great but getting smaller. Review #49:We decided to stay here for three nights during our trip to Seattle. The checkin clerk was very friendly and said she would ensure we had a good view. We ended up on the 11th floor overlooking the airport and the Cascades. We had a balcony, the beds were super comfortable, room was a good size and clean. There are restaurants all around, plus two in the hotel. Shuttle to airport runs every 20 minutes. Great place and would definately stay again. Review #50:I've stayed at the Doubletree several times when I need to fly in and out of Seattle. It's a solid 3* hotel and good value. Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night. If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate. The cons for me aren't a huge issue since I'm just overnighting it, but would be more significant for a prolonged stay. Review #51:We found the Doubletree to be good for what we needed- a place to stay when our plane arrived late and we didn't want to start driving anywhere until the next day. The airport shuttle was very good- better than other hotels I have stayed in. It seemed to ALWAYS be running, and was very convenient. We took the shuttle from the airport, and then back again to pick up our rental car (save the parking fee). The hotel was fine- a big hotel by the airport. I didn't expect much, but some things were better than average. The view we had was of some large trees and some people's backyards- better than the parking lot for us (but I wouldn't want to live there!). The cookies are, of course, one of our favorite things about the Doubletree chain. If I had been wanting to stay for more than one night, be close to anything interesting (other than the artificially created world of SEATAC), or wanted to get some business done, this would not have been the best hotel. But it is fine for what it is- a quick, convenient, comfortable stay by the airport. One thing to think about- this hotel is used by a lot of conventions. When we were there, there were a bunch of real estate agents who were getting a bit rowdy. We couldn't hear them in our room (thankfully), but they were pretty loud throughout the hotel. The hotel is big and busy, so it always feels like there is some commotion going on in the common areas. We did book directly on the Hilton chain website and got a rate of about $89. It looks from other reviews here like you may be able to do better on Priceline if you don't want your Hilton points. Review #52:I was put into this property by an airline due to a maintenance issue, although I checked in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, I saw enough that I want to return! The pool area, lobby and view from the balcony were very nice, not what I normally find when traveling and especially not this close to the airport! From reading others reviews I was not in the main towers, and only complaint was only being on the second floor someone was above me and from the sound they made walking must have weighed 400 pounds as it was very loud. Other than that, I was greeted very nicely and professionally at the desk by a staff member that had a very irate customer on the phone, in spite of him trying his best from the portion of the conversation I heard, he continued to handle himself in a professional manner, then when he place the caller on hold to assist me, was very courteous and professional. As others have mentioned as well, who's night is not made better when checking in and receiving a warm cookie? The room was nice, comfortable beds, good selection of pillows, nice TV channel selections (was no guide so I had to search for channels). The two sinks were nice (one in the bath portion and one by the closet) that would be a nice feature if traveling with your spouse or children. Also nice view of some trees out the balcony. While the wing I was in appeared to be older, you could tell they try to take care of it and it was very clean. Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor. I have also found that requesting rooms at the end of the hall are quieter. I look forward to returning to this property with my wife and being able to spend more time in the city as well as what the doubletree has to offer! Review #53:Arrived late, they had given our room away. Diamond members get a small gift...it was three pieces of fruit on a stick and two pieces of cheese...can you say cheesy!! Cookies were good, as always. Went to breakfast and got some french toast. Then there was this set-up for the syrup which was under a sterno can and full flame, the syrup was boiling. It was so liquified that it spilled all over my hand and burned me terribly. If it wasn't for Pam the waitress quick actions and bringing me ice, I am sure it would have blistered terribly. I am grateful she was quick. Keep your children away from these set ups, they are going to injure someone terribly! Review #54:We arrived to the hotel July 23rd. late at night. I had called earlier in the day and was assured a roll-a-way was available for us. When we arrived we were told by the front desk the roll-a-way would be sent up immediately and would probably be there before we got up to the room. 90 minutes later we still did not have the bed. We had been told the bed would be sent at 12:00 midnight. At 1:00AM we were again told the bed would be sent right up. At 1:30 the manager on duty (Named Robert) introduced himself to my husband at the front desk. Robert immediately stepped in front of my husband and folded his arms and gave my husband many excuses why it was our fault we didn't have the bed yet. One excuse was that the hotel was full and they didn't have time to serve us as customers. I talked to the manager on the phone at 1:30AM and he was still full of excuses why we didn't have the bed. We were tired and against Trip Advisor's advice we went to the restaurant at the hotel for a late night snack. We ordered food and received ice cold food one hour later. The final straw was the morning we left. I noticed the statement was not under the door on the day we were leaving. When we did leave, there on the floor OUTSIDE our door was our statement with our name on it. Thank God our credit card number wasn't there. Review #55:Great location within view or shuttle ride from the airport. Princess has the contract for cruise passengers so you'll meet a lot of people coming and going on trips in the lobby or restaurant. Breakfast was delicious in the coffee shop, hot scones with jam and coffee. Other restaurants were withing walking distance of the hotel. There's a concierge desk which I found to be very helpful with questions. Free internet usage in the lobby too! I reserved off Priceline and got a great rate. Review #56:Bought our stay here on Priceline. Got a good deal $45 for the night. It is hard to find fault at that price, and I won't. But although the room was huge and lavish with two large queens, it was not a place I enjoyed. Our room was in the farthest section of the hotel, and tedious to get into to, and by the time we got settled it was too much trouble to go out to eat. No frig or microwaves in Doubletree hotels, too many pillows on the bed. The room had a large balcony overlooking a lake and on the 4th floor we were up in the trees. Despite the low rate, the receptionist tried to give us the type of room I wanted (high floor, one bed) and was very pleasant to me. A beautiful hotel for other types of travelers - groups, business people, etc. For those using the hotel to fly there are shuttles, flight info, and a kiosk to print out boarding passes (although it did not work for me). Just too too big for a one night stay, but a lovely hotel after all. Review #57:This hotel is a nice size and is convenient to the airport and restaurants. The fitness room is small but the bedrooms are standard. The staff was very helpful with all my business and pesonal needs. The hotel gave me 3 vouchers for $10 of any meal since I am a Hilton honors platinum members. That worked well for me since the food at the hotel is fairly pricey. Review #58:Don't expect a whole lot here. It is an average airport hotel. Confusing layout. Larger than normal rooms do make things more comfortable. The bathrooms are worn and need updating. The workout rooms are decent - especially the larger one in Building Five. Review #59:I sateyed here with husband and 1 year old son. One night we arrieved to find out patio door left wide open. We were on the first floor. There were also 2 cigarette butts on the small patio. Nothing was missing from our room but we were gone for over 10 hours that day and I do not know how long the door was open. The manager comped our parking ($17/day) but he was supposed to let us know who the last person to open our room door was and they never told us. This hotel is by a small lake and at dusk there are misquitos and misc. other bugs every where. I would not recommend this hotel. The only good thing about it was that i booked it on Priceline and got a really good price. Review #60:We stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport for our early morning flight. Although there was a queue at check in the staff offered us warm cookies and appologised for the delay. We were given a free room upgrade (we are Hilton Honors members). The room was a bit basic and dated but it was inexpensive and we could leave our car in their car park while we were on holiday. Shuttle to the airport every 20 mins 24 hours. The restaurant also had good food (we were given a $10 per person coupon to use in the restaurant from the hotel). Friendy waiter/waitress staff. Review #61:If you are staying near the airport, it is a great hotel. Easy to reach, very clean and well-appointed rooms. I was surprised at how nice the rooms were! The bed was amazingly comfortable. It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning. The coffee bar in the lobby was handy, too! Review #62:The good: large room, food at the restaurants (especially the clam chowder), bed, view from the elevators, service, shuttle every 20 minutes to and from the airport (5 minutes away) The bad: the insulation for the windows is awful, so the hotel is extremely noisy at night (at least if you are facing the airport): airplanes, busy airport boulevard, rooftop with furnaces/chillers etc. No wireless in the rooms. Cheap toiletries, few towels. Review #63:We really won the gamble with this hotel. We booked through a discount website and were completely satisfied with our stay. (For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet. It even had a balcony! The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. On check in, the warm chocolate chip cookies were a lovely touch. All the staff we interacted with were great. I noticed many airline crews stayed at this hotel also. Our room was in the main tower, and was reached by an external elevator with glass walls. Getting to the room was a fun adventure in itself. We explored the other areas of this large hotel complex and noticed some rooms were actually are on a small lake, and others overlook the attractive outdoor pool. There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended. I can not say I slept well, but I think that was due to nerves and excitement about our pending vacation. I did find the beds comfortable, but very jiggly. Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water. I was also woken by the cries of a baby in a nearby room. The most disturbing noises came not from the jet planes across the street, but from the hallway. They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin. There is a Jack in the Box and Denny's across the street as well as a Subway, Thai restaurant and a BBQ restaurant nearby. The shuttle service to the airport ran frequently and was very convenient. If traveling with children, there is oodles of space to set up a portable crib. The hotel felt nice enough for a romantic getaway and was a nice treat as a stop-over. The room also had Wi-Fi access - we even had Wi-Fi on the pool deck! Overall, a great stay. Review #64:We have stayed at the DoubleTree Seatac more than 15 times, love it. I suggest getting a room in the tower. Upgrade to King Corner Room or Penthouse to really treat yourself, balcony are amazing in these rooms. Service is outstanding, there nightclub is always fun and classy. Don't have to worry about drinking and driving, just a elevator ride to your room! Review #65:I arrived late at night and was flustered by the confusing and poorly lit parking options. I was staying at the hotel for under 8 hours and yet the clerk who checked me in was still encouraging me to pay for the valet parking. At my prompting he suggested the self-park behind the hotel but it was almost as expensive as the valet! The hotel room was fine, but I am not sure that this was worth it. I am a loyal Hilton customer and am glad to get the points but this hotel seems better-suited to guests staying for several days, not for someone who just wants a place to crash before an early flight. Review #66:I had a quick stay here last week for one night. The good news - the hotel is very close to the airport with a 24hr shuttle to the airport. My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting. The not so good news - food at the hotel was OK. I believe there are better options in walking distance from the hotel. Review #67:Our family stayed at the Doubletree for one night before flying out to Miami for a Caribbean cruise. We parked our car there for a week, and were impressed with the service and rates compared with the airport. The rooms are a good size, which is a bonus for me as I was traveling with my husband and two large teenaged sons in one room. We spent a good portion of our early evening at the pool, which has an awesome setting. We had dinner in the attached restaurant, and the food was absolutely delicious. After a good nights sleep, the free shuttle to the airport saved us a lot of stress! We would definitely stay here again when flying out of Seattle! Review #68:I stayed here for a week in June, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous. The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat. A great hotel that I would happily stay again in. Review #69:I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience. Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code. I always ask for a room near the lobby and am always accomodated. The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle. The rooms are always clean, the beds great, bedding and bath linens top notch. They recently have gone to flat sceen televisions throughout the place which was overdue but is greatly appreciated. I've always found staff friendly and every request granted. Airport pickup runs every 15 minutes. The cookies are a nice touch too. I'm always pleased when my Priceline bid results in the Doubletree Review #70:This room was one of the most comfortable rooms I've stayed at in a long time. Cushy bed, flat screen tv, great water pressure. Room was quiet and the shuttle to the airport runs 24 hours. I was there by myself and felt very safe. On the downside, I just recently tried to make a reservation for another night with my husband, and they want to charge $10 for the second person. (Yet they gave me two queens) Review #71:We stayed here for 1 night in August since we had an early flight the next morning. Check in was easy and the cookies were nice. Having the printer in the lobby to print your boarding pass was really convenient. The elevators for the tower are not close. We wanted to carry our own luggage and got tired of the bell hops asking if they could take it for us. They were not too thrilled when we wanted to borrow their cart. t was a very long walk to get to the room. The room itself was nice but not for $200.00 per night. The inner hall was quiet but there was a lot of traffic noise from the outside. The bed was comfortable but between the noise of the traffic ( not the jets) and the room fan, we did not sleep well. There was mildew in the bathroom-cleanliness was fair. The shuttle to the airport was very nice and had bottled water. We would not stay here again because of the noise and mildew. Review #72:We took a Park'n'Fly package which allows us to stay 1 night and park our vehicle for up to 7 days. This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling. The Front staff were friendly and efficient in getting us checked in and taken care of. Even got free cookies - wasn't expecting that. The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms. Use the map the front desk provide and you will have no issues. Our room was nice and clean and on the back side (away from street traffic), plus only heard planes when we has the sliding door opened. We didn't have a chance to use the pool, although enticing. We were able to grab a quick bite and coffee at the convenience Starbucks in the lobby on our way out to our flight. We would gladly stay here again! Review #73:Before departing to New York, we stopped overnight in Seattle and stayed at this hotel after scoring a great deal from Priceline. The hotel is huge and they give you warm cookies once you check-in. The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport. Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!). The only downside is that the lady at the front desk gave us the weirdest directions to get to our hotel room. We ended up going outside, and around and got lost when we found out later that we could have just gone around the corner from the check-in desk. We loved that they were playing the Canucks game in the restaurant/bar, too! The airport shuttle service was great, friendly and on-time. Staff is very courteous and friendly. Review #74:I've stayed here a couple of times. The chocolate chip cookies are always a treat. The rooms are clean and nicely appointed. I used the computer in the lobby to print my boarding pass. The shuttle is convenient and reliable. It is on a busy street and I didn't see a restaurant within walking distance so I ate in the lobby. It was fine. Review #75:Hotel is very close the the airport and room was comfortable. Had a huge mirror in the bathroom that was well light around the edges. Wolfgang Puck coffee was available for the in room coffee maker, My room was in the tower on the 8th floor and had a balcony. Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof it's $12.95 + tax. If you have a AAA membership they will give you 25% off. That's where I parked. Review #76:As prior reviewers state, great place to stay the night before a flight. Stayed with my teenage son. Wonderfully quiet, considering the airport is literally across the street. Rooms large and comfortable. But still charging for the internet!! (and no in room wireless). It may be a profit center, but when Best Western gives free internet, it is time to change the policy. Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste. I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night. Review #77:On a recent US trip we probably stayed in about 10 hotels and this one wouldn't rank in the top 20! This is a very large and confusingly laid out hotel. When we found our room we discovered that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there were dirty towels lying around. We advised reception who promised immediate action. When we returned about 10 hours later nothing had been done. We were offered a change of room and the assistance of a three man team to move. We began loading our luggage ourselves and when no-one arrived I headed to reception to be greeted by one man with our new room key. He made no offer to assist. No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist. We had decided to go with this hotel to save a small amount of money and as a change from the Cedarbrook lodge we had stayed in a couple of weeks before. Big mistake. On the basis of this experience I will never choose a Doubletree hotel again. It is just not worth the money. Review #78:We stayed 3 days at the Doubletree Hotel in July 2006. The front desk staff were grouchy, uninterested and not pleasant to deal with. We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel. We were quite surprised as this was the only hotel during our two week Washington State vacation that did not provide a fantastic experience. Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable and spacious. I would not stay at a Doubletree Hotel again. It must be an unhappy place to work because it sure comes through to the customer. Spend your money at a hotel that does not see guests as interruptions in their day. Review #79:After a miserable day at Sea-Tac, we thought the Doubletree would be heaven. Well, not quite. The hotel is divided into different wings. The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty. The decor and bathroom are straight from the 70's!! ( Liekthe Brady bunch!). Rooms are not particularly posh or large. Ours was kind of dingy, definitely in need of a remodeling. My wife and I stayed only 1 night before flying out of Sea-Tac the next morning. Hotel was fine for our purposes, but I wouldn't have wanted a longer stay there. Beds were very comfortble . Free internet access in the lobby only and open 24 hrs. . Pool and whirlpool were nice, but would prefer 24 hr. access like health club. Room service was typically expensive . We ate at both the lounge and the cafe and food was average at best, but the service VERY GOOD! (Eben the bus boy made sure we were served well) The front desk staff was also very good! The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture. The room room's AC was working fine and it was pretty quite. No airplane or traffic sounds. The free airport shuttle runs every 15 mins or so and really helped us catch our flight the next morning. So overall you get what you pay for. I got a good night sleep. Review #80:We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased. We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels. The rooms were very spacious, modern and clean. The shuttle was an extremely convenient as well. I would highly recommend the Doubletree and plan on staying here again on our next trip. Review #81:Like many before us, we stayed here before heading out to somewhere else the next day. The check-in was a bit slow, but when our turn came, I could understood why because the desk staff was incredibly friendly and determined to answer all of our questions--she was a very nice person. In fact every staff member that we encountered here was friendly. We had a double queen room in the tower, looking out towards the mountains. The room was quiet, very comfy beds and we enjoyed the view from the 10th floor; the room and hallways could use an update, but are perfectly adequate. The tower rooms do have balconies but the space is shared with the room next door and divided by a set of austere looking bars--plus there is no furniture to sit on so the balconies are not really functional. I am told there are good Thai and BBQ restaurants within walking distance across the street. We tried the hotel restaurants and the food was quite good. Hotel pool is outside, heated to a nice temp and there is a hot tub nearby with a nice seating area all around. Self-parking is $19. Internet is free if you have HH Gold and works well. All in all a fine stay. Review #82:I stayed one night at this hotel, as we were flying out early the next morning. The hotel is conveniently located, just across the street from the airport entrance with a free shuttle that runs every 20 minutes. I was disappointed to learn there was a fee for parking ($16+tax), a fee for Internet ($5 for one hour), no simple breakfast included. When we tried to leave, our paid parking pass wouldn't register to let us out of the parking lot, and there were no attendants handy, so we were late returning our rental car :( -- I'm thankful we didn't get dinged on that. The hotel was nice; good clean rooms. Our room was connected to the main lobby by a skyway; we were in building 5 -- it wasn't very close. On the plus side, we got warm cookies upon check-in. The diner next door was good -- I think it's 'Dave's Diner'. Overall, it was a nice hotel, if you are prepared to pay for it. Review #83:My husband and I stayed here for one night before a cruise. This is a huge hotel. Clean rooms, comfortable bed. If you use their free airport shuttle service, make sure you get on the right shuttle from the airport because there is another Double Tree with a separate shuttle. Review #84:Stayed for one night before catching a flight out of Sea-tac Airport. Booked thru hotwire and got such a great price ($69) we were worried what we'd be getting.... We were very pleasantly suprised!! We were greeted by very nice front desk staff and were given the Doubletree warm welcome cookies...what a nice touch! The room was very clean, cozy and very quiet even though it was so close to the airport. The hotel it's self was huge, but yet it still felt very comfortable. It has that \"west-coast\" feel to it with lots of wood and glimpses of green forrest outside. The beds were amazing. The restaurant was quite good considering it's not \"downtown\". The food was decent as was the wine selection. We will definately stay here again. Review #85:We needed a hotel near the airport for just one night, and selected the Doubletree. It was a great decision. Our plane landed at noon, and when I called about an early check-in there was no problem. In spite of the fact that a large convention was concluding and check-out time was not until noon, they had our room ready and waiting. The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and a large selection of various pillows. There was a good TV, and nice bathroom with thick towels and plenty of hot water. Every room seemed to have a balcony. Our balcony looked over the pool enhanced with mature Pacific Northwest landscape. We loved the decor of the hotel. It was very suitable to the geography, and we did not have that feeling that we were just in any big hotel in any big city. We were especially impressed with the staff at the hotel. Our check-in and check-out were accomplished efficiently by pleasant and personable people. You absolutely cannot beat a Doubletree chocolate chip cookie as a welcome treat. My only complaint about this hotel was the charge for parking. I thought it was a little expensive for a hotel not located in the center of the city to charge $15 per day to park a car. Nonetheless, we will certainly stay at this hotel when we return to Seattle again. Review #86:I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The room we stayed in was beautiful! Newer furniture, very comfortable bed with nice linens, two large sink areas and super clean. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the spa/pool area and they have a nice lounge with free internet access terminals. Free shuttle to the airport got us to the terminal in about 3 minutes! If you are looking for a place to stay near the airport - this is a great one! Review #87:Located within a few miles of Sea-Tac this is a very large hotel with a Starbucks, gift shop, meeting rooms, breakfast room, bar and dining room. The food was a little expensive-$13 for a burger and $12 for an omelette alone. However it was good enough. I had a spacious and clean suite with fridge, microwave, nice sized table and a comfortable bed. I loved that the heating system was quiet. I had plently of outlets, but my suite on the 12th floor had recently been remodeled. The walk out balcony was a nice surprise. It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings. From the wings it was a bit of a hike to the restaurants and front desk. Nice pool and fitness areas. Parking is expensive at $25 for valet and $21.50 for self-park per night. Free shuttle to and from airport helps. Verify internet price-not free. Good jumping off spot for wherever you want to go. Review #88:We stayed at this hotel one night before an Alaska cruise. We arrived very late, were greeted at the desk by a friendly employee who handed us a warm chocolate chip cookie to munch on while we were waiting for our room key. The breakfast in the restaurant was amazing, and the staff was very attentive and friendly. The room was very clean and comfortable. The gift shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced. We would highly recommend this hotel for before and after cruising because it is minutes from the airport and is lovely. Review #89:Well appointed, clean, convenient to airport and travels south of Seattle However, we were not informed by Priceline when we made resesrvations that hotel guests are charged $16/day +tax of $1.52 to park in the HUGE hotel parking lot. To add insult to injury, for people who use the parking lot to \"park and fly\", the charge is $7.95/day, almost half of what the hotel guests are charged!! What a rip-off! ! Review #90:Stayed one night here after coming in late, before leaving the next morning. Used points, so I don't know the regular room rate. Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport. but had some issues too. Details... GOOD: --Rooms, in the tower where we stayed, are pretty decent. Plenty big, nicely kept bathrooms, bed was fairly comfy. --Rooms have a small deck, but the view is of the airport - nothing spectacular. --Staff was friendly, both at the desk and in the restaurant. --Location is very convenient to the airport, and pretty quick access to I-5. --Cookies at check in were good. ;) BAD: --YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE. This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking. This place had a gigantic parking lot. I think parking cost $12 or so. Ripoff. --Restaurant staff seemed to be overwhelmed during breakfast, so they fell behind a bit. Food was good, but a bit overpriced. --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property. --Common areas could be kept up better and cleaner. --The doors to the rooms have a huge gap at the bottom - allows a lot of light and sound in from the hallway. If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice. But you may want to consider other places as well, shop around a bit. Review #91:Love that the hotel provided a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, every 15-20mins. The Hotel was clean, great staff, was greeted with hot fresh cookies at the check-in counter. My daughter, 5yrs old, loved it! My husband was hoping there was an indoor pool, but the pool was warm, and the hot tub was awesome. Pool hours was morning until 11pm. If you don't want to eat breakfast at the hotel, there is a Denny's across the street and an IHOP 2mile down the street. Buses are available for $2.00 and the Rail is $5.00 round trip to WestLake, Seattle, and back to the SeaTac. Love riding the Rail from SeaTac to downtown and the Monorial is $2.00 to the Space Needle. ($4.00 roundtrip). I didn't rent a car, so didn't have the worries of paying a parking fee at the hotel. No need for a car, I got around just fine on the busses and the Rail. My room was very easy to find, but I know others had some difficulties finding their rooms. Maxi's, is a club to the top of the hotel. Heard it was great, but didn't check it out, as we had our daughter with us. Enjoyed they had computers available, and a printer so you can print out your boarding pass. Even though the hotel was close to the airport, you couldn't haer the planes taking off, it was quiet and very relaxing. Slept like a baby...very comfortable beds. Will stay there again in the future. Review #92:We have stayed at several Seatac airport hotels, all acceptable. This trip we needed a quick access to the airport with wheelchair accessibility and this was it. After this stay we will only stay here in the future when at Seatac. They not only are wheelchair accessible, but have an ADA van and very courteous staff that doesn't act put-out at having to help disabled guests. The hotel itself is very nice, we were given a very recently updated room in the tower. The restaurant and bar restaurant are better than average and again great staff. My husband was quite happy with the clam chowder he ordered at the bar after a late night arrival, and that's saying something! The beds were very comfortable, room large enough for wheelchair, and bathroom clean. All good! Review #93:This property is a mess. It is laid out in wings that make carrying your bags a nightmare, up elevators and down again. When you finally reach your room the heaters all make tremendous noise, rattle, rumble. I changed rooms six times before deciding that all the wings were the same with traffic noise, heater noise, and all the hiking and dragging bags from room to room. I asked for a room in their Tower, but was told that Priceline customers had to pay a ten dollar a night premium, which I GLADLY paid. But the nightmare wasn't over, then it took three more tries to get a room with a non-rattling heater and sliding doors that sealed and did not let the traffic noise in. It's NO three star hotel at all. Priceline should be ASHAMED of rating it up with the Hilton SEATAC, where I was placed on the first night. The Hilton is a great hotel, but the Doubletree is purely a nightmare. Review #94:We stayed one night here before our flight home and I wish we had stayed here longer! What a great place. Warm cookies when you arrive. The parking situation was a bit weird - we had a rental we needed to return and we were given 20 free minutes to unload and get the car out, but the rental return was next door, whcih was nice. The rooms were gorgeous and spacious and comfortable. For $5 we got an upgrade to a family suite - which has 2 connecting rooms, 2 sinks AND a full bath. You cannot beat this for families. The pool was huge and gorgeous. This was cheaper than the hotel we stayed at downtown and I think in the future I would look for places like this outside the city and get a rental car to drive into the city. Review #95:This was a great hotel. Close to the airport. They provided a shuttle if you do not have a car. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very nice. The swimming pool looked nice but we didn't get the chance to swim. We had dinner in the bar area. It was good and the staff was attentive. Check in and check out was easy and fast. It was a long ackward walk to our room. You go up stairs, down the elevator and thorugh doors. Odd but we made it. Surprisingly since this was close to the airport, we weren't woken up by any airplanes. Review #96:Expecting the Doubletree name to be better quality. The room was okay, but not as clean as one would expect. And then the real zinger was the unexpected additional parking charge! Our room was reserved well in advance, with no mention of a parking fee for their guests! Shame on you Doubletree for charging your own guests to pay to park on your site during their stay. I will not stay in a Doubletree again. Review #97:We stayed here for a couple of nights at the start of our US vacation. We had a large room very clean and well furnished. Breakfast was good and the staff were very helpful. Hotel shuttle picked us up at the airport and took us to the light rail station to go into Seattle the next day. It wasn't noisy at all as you might expect being so close to the runways. Review #98:Stayed in the high-rise portion. Room was spacious and clean. Nice size bath. Ate at on-site bar/restaurant which was good. Staff asked family with small child to move to restaurant portion which was the right thing to do. Lobby has PC with printer to check in to airline and print boarding pass. Printer didn't work but able to check in for flight. Complimentary shuttle nice although couldn't fit everyone on a Sunday mid-AM! Review #99:I stayed in this hotel for 1 day, as a side trip from Vancouver. Yes it is a bit far from downtown, but very close to the airport. The hotel interior itself is a bit outdated, but the room we stayed in (in the tower) was very pleasant, relaxing and modern. I absolutely loved the warm cookies we were given at check in and the beds in our room were so incredibly soft. I actually miss the beds! The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating. I will definitely stay here again when I visit Seattle.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "human"}

This hotel lured me to book with it with its relatively lower price, nice photos, and good reviews. It turns out that the hotel IS pretty great. The front-desk staff was pleasant and helpful (we had to store our luggage with them for a day after checking out and there were no problems), the lobby was gorgeous, the breakfast was top notch (and free! ), and our room was perfect, with silky smooth bedsheets, a clean bathroom, and ample space. The only problem is when you step outside to use the pool and hottub - the swim-up bar is cute and the hamburger fare offered there is good (albeit a bit too salty), but every ten minutes it sounded like an airplane was about to crash-land on your head. I could not believe how noisy it was, and I've lived near LGA airport all my life. It was literally like the planes were landing next door (and I guess they sort of were). Fortunately, the hotel itself is well insulated, so the noise doesn't affect you at all when you're inside. If it weren't for the noisy pool, the hotel would be an easy A+ (and probably cost a lot more). As it is, I give it an A-. Review #1:My husband and I flew down to San Juan for our friends' wedding this past weekend. Since we knew we couldn't make this trip any sort of vacation, and to call it a getaway was pushing it, we wanted to stay somewhere clean, comfortable and efficient. We got that and so much more! The location was perfect. It's right across the street from the El San Juan hotel (site of the wedding), a Walgreens and Lupi's, a Mexican restaurant recommended to us (it did not disappoint). Plus, the value is the best I've seen in a long time. There's the free breakfast (not gourmet or cooked to order, but there were plenty of options and everything tasted good), the lovely pool area with swim-up bar and grill with burgers so juicy they rival those at In-N-Out and Five Guys, the comfy bed, the flatscreen TV with all the channels of home as well as a plethora of Spanish-speaking ones, the business center and the efficiency of check-in and check-out that could not be beat. Obviously it's not the best choice if you want a luxurious, long-term vacation. This is because it's not on the beach (but it's a block away), and if you want a poolside cocktail, you need to get up and get it yourself rather than have a waiter bring it to you. But I'd recommend this hotel to folks who either are in town briefly for an event or who need a place to stay before or after a cruise. Although, I must say we're tempted to stay here even for a full-on vacation after reading the horrible reviews about the cleanliness and service at the El San Juan hotel. The El San Juan is THE place to be for dancing and partying (and weddings -- the wedding we attending was fabulous), no doubt, but even we noticed dirty couches and an overall indifference of the staff when it came to actually doing their jobs. Review #2:I stayed with my bf. The bedroom is big & clean, the bed is super comfortable & king size, have a very good size TV, the bathroom was ok, but the bathtub was a bit small. The beach is 5 minute walk & you can find various fast foods near the place so you dont have to waste money. Overall, I had a lovely, fun & romantic experience. Can't wait to go back. HIGHLY RECOMENDED! Review #3:We just needed a place to stay for one night between getting back from Vieques and flying out of San Juan. This was a great place for that. The room was lovely and was air conditioned and had a TV with cable, which was nice after being in various locations around PR for 10 days. It was more of a suite than a room, with a living room area with a wet bar and then a separate room that was a bedroom. Both rooms had tvs. It was very close to the airport and the breakfast was nice and included with the room. We would definitely stay here again to be close to the airport, though if this is the only place you stay in PR, you are missing the best part. Review #4:This hotel was very nice and clean and the staff was very nice. However, the Isla Verde area is quite dumpy and I felt nervous walking around it. Also, the airplanes are way too loud and ruin the atmosphere. I was with my sister and our children and we were hit on more than once by some shady looking guys which made me really uncomfortable with our young children around. The beach in Isla Verde was dirty and stinky. We didn't even get wet. We stayed at this hotel because we had an early morning flight. I would only recommend staying there if you need to be close to the airport. We also stayed 4 days at the Carbie Hilton, which was very nice. If they could move the hotel to a nice part of town, I'd stay there again. Review #5:One of our better choices without breaking our budget . Clean and modern facility which even included breakfasts. We would have a quick breakfast and be gone all day seeing the island. Often didn't return to our room till late at night and were never disapponted with the hotel. Great facilty for familes - kids always were in the pool having fun. Review #6:This is a very nice hotel, We love ti, is very private, Front Desk all the agents there are very nice and friendly specially Dianna, she's always wealling to help. Housekeeping is excellent! Maintenance is great! this hotel is very clean, smells good, the pool is very confortable, the rooms are very nice, very clean and the beds are awesome! This hotel is very nice, confortable and customer service is great! Review #7:We stayed at Hampton Inn for one night pre-cruise. It was a quick 10 minute ride from the airport and about 20 minute drive to the Pan Am cruise pier. The morning of checkout we found an employee outside who was helping guests get cabs and we had no trouble finding one immediately. The rooms were quiet, in spite of the proximity to the airport. There are many restaurants within walking distance. We walked across the street and were on a beautiful beach within just a few minutes, where we enjoyed pleasant walk, then into the casino of the El San Juan Hotel for a little gambling in their casino. Then into the pool and hot tub for more evening relaxation. The Hampton staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! When we asked a question, they would respond and always add \"...is there anything else I can do for you?\" The breakfast buffet was excellent and plentiful, with lots of seating area and tables for everyone. Hampton exceeded my expectations and I would definitely stay there in the future. Review #8:Have stayed at this hotel twice pre cruise and loved it. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms a clean and comfortable. Location is very good 5 minutes from airport and a short walk to the beach. We find this hotel to be the best value for your dollar and have it booked again this year pre and post cruise, which we are very much looking forward to. Review #9:We were here for one night post cruise just to relax and we were delighted with the service and amenities. Wireless internet is a plus after being without for a week. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The location was decent just a two block walk to the beach and the main street. The beach was very nice. Would stay here again especially for the price booked with hotwire. Review #10:This is a fine location for a quick stopover in San Juan. The clean, nicely furnished hotel is in the Isla Verde tourist district immediately adjacent to the airport, close to several casinos and numerous eateries. People sensitive to noise should try to avoid rooms in Tower A, which is closest to the airport runways and immediately next to a cock fighting arena whose combatants greet the dawn collectively. Review #11:This is a great place to stay. Although there is airplane noise out at the pool, it was rarely heard inside. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The breakfast is great. The pool is wonderful and well kept. There are lots of good restaurants at the big hotels nearby but be prepared..they are pricey! all in all, we really enjoyed our stay here!! ! Review #12:Prior to going to this hotel I did read a negative review about bedbugs; and the first thing I did when I got into the room was check for them--nothing! But what I will say is this, the hotel was very clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful; and the breakfast was excellent. Each morning we were up at 6 am, and at breakfast by 7:30 am. ; it was empty, quiet, and a pleasure. I grew up with parents who always left the hotel maid a tip, and I am no different, but I was really surprised that my maid, (her name is Blanca) did not take my tip; and I was curious why? Unfortunately, she didn't work on the weekends! Walgreens is right across the street, and also on that side of the street you can keep straight, veer off to your left, and you are on the beach. Its a beautiful beach, and is great for early morning risers and rising sun seekers. Loved it, and its really less than a 5 minute walk, at best. We also rented a car with Alamo, and the hotel charged only $5 a day for parking. Overall, it was a good hotel to stay at. Review #13:I took my two college age kids for a Chrismtas vacation and this hotel was very adequate and priced great. The beach is a few blocks away and there area ton of shops and restaurants close as well as a supermarket a few blocks away. It was a very safe area and i would recommend if you have a tight budget to stay here. Review #14:I think this is the nicest Hampton Inn we have stayed at. We paid in the mid 250s because everything was booked Presidents's Day weekend, but we were totally pleased with the hotel. I had previously stayed at the Hilton Caribe and really liked that - its a better location for getting to Old Town - but the Hampton is opposite the street from the Ritz and other hotels, allowing more access to restaurants, casinos, etc. The hotel is very clean (far more so than the four star El Conquistador Resort, for example!) and the beds are as good as the best Westin beds. The breakfast is an actual hot breakfast, plus so many other choices of cereals, juices, breads, and bagels, fruit, yogurt, granola, etc. - better than most Hampton Inns. The rooms were quite, the pool looked nice (we did not use) and the staff were helpful. I highly recommend this hotel over many four star establishments in Puerto Rico! Review #15:We just came back from beautiful San Juan and I have to tell you guys the hotel was almost perfect...buffet breakfast,reasonable price,kind and charming staff,pleasant pull (little bit dirty though ) good location...but....bed bugs!!!! I can't stop scratching my self!! So now you know, and I believe not every bed is infected ,but mine was...:( and yes internet was impossible to use cause it was too slow. Review #16:We stayed at the Hamtpon Inn & Suites for spring break and had a wonderful experience! It's a great hotel for the price, not to mention in a good location. The staff was very nice and offered lots of suggestions for places to eat and have fun; they also had answers to all our questions. The Business Center with free internet and printing was a nice surprise, and there was also wireless in the room. The hotel overall is well-kept and clean and the beds are small but comfortable. When I go back to Puerto Rico, I will definitely book at the Hampton Inn! Review #17:We got stuck in San Juan after being bumped off our flights all day long. We fly stand by, so we're not eligible to have our hotel paid for by the airline. We had just spent 4 days at the Embassy Suites Dorado del Mar, and had been at the airport since 5 AM. The last flight left at 7:45 PM without us on it and so we called around to find a hotel. We got to the Hampton Inn & Suites around 9 PM. We were exhausted. Since we are a family of 5, a room with 2 beds doesn't accomodate us. After explaning our situation with being stranded and having sat with 3 kids at the airport all day, I asked for a roll away and was told it was going to be another $20 or we could switch the room type and have a pull out couch for an additonal $40. The room rate was already pretty steep. Our rate for a suite at the Embassy Suites in Dorado which included 2 beds and a pull out couch on a beautiful resort property was less before these additonal charges even! We declined both and took the standard (overpriced) room. Our teenager slept on the floor. The room was nice, but a little worn. The walls had scuff marks on them everywhere and the furniture is pretty banged up. Also, the room is pretty cramped. The pool and the pool bar were right out side of our window, so it was a little noisy. We went back downstairs and asked if there was anywhere to eat. The front desk employees were friendly and helpful and gave us a lot of options of places we could walk to for dinner. We returned and went to sleep and checked out the next morning at 5 AM. This hotel is nice, but definitely overpriced. Review #18:We stayed at this hotel for one night. We booked through travelocity. We were delayed one night and travelocity said the hotel would not refund us our money for the night, so oh well, live and learn. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The room itself was pretty clean except for some black marks on the walls. I didn't complain because I was so exhausted from sleeping at the (ATL)airport the night before. I would stay here again for one night but if I was planning a longer stay in San Juan, I would pay the extra money for a four or five star resort. Review #19:This hotel has to be a sleeper. We have stayed in San Juan on 4 previous occasions over the past 10 years prior to cruising and this is by far and away the best hotel we have experienced. Not only is it less expensive than where we stayed in the past, the rooms (suites?) are larger - about 500 sq ft if you choose a poolview room - the entire hotel is spotless, it's within walking distance from many restaurants, other hotels, car rental agencies, and the beach which incidentally we don't think is that good. The modest comp breakfast satisfies, the burgers at the pool bar are super and the airport noise is a non issue in the rooms due to excellent double paned windows. Forget the over pricing at the hotels with casinos on the beach, you can walk to 3 of them from the Hampton and it's more comfortable. Review #20:We stayed at this place for 2 days...really a nice place to stay and is very near to airport aswell Old san Juan...checked in real quick..and the receptionist was very helpful in giving the maps and directions to Old San Juan...there was WIFI in the room...room service was good ..the only issue was the noise from the AC was not sure was this the problem with all the rooms or only with that of ours..:( and served the continental breakfast.The area nearby was gud for wandering..all together a nice place to stay... Review #21:We stayed here last Sunday for one overnight after disembarking from a 7 day cruise. This was our second stay here and it met our needs perfectly. We arrived at the hotel at about 8:30am and no surprise, there was no room ready for us. That was okay because we then took a ride (we rented a car from Avis after getting off the ship) to El Yunque rain forest and explored for a couple of hours. When we returned, the room was ready and we hung out at the pool for a while. We did plan to take advantage of the poolside grill for dinner, but when I walked up and ordered two burgers I was told that it would be at least an hour wait. Hmmm...we went to plan \"B\" and walked down to the beach/pier and went to a nice little restaurant instead - \"La Playita.\" Our flight home was at 10:30am Monday so we had a leisurely morning to finish packing and have breakfast before the 5 minute ride to the airport. We had none of the problems listed in some of the prior reviews. I did not give it 5 stars because it is not a 5 star hotel. It's clean with a friendly staff and typical Hampton Inn amenities. We paid $190 US for this night. Staying that one extra night saved us about $400 on airfare, and twist my arm, I had to stay in Puerto Rico for one more night. It was a great addition to a wonderful vacation week. Review #22:Although this hotel costs more than I usually pay for Hampton, it is worth it. It is modern and clean as a pin. The location is excellent. It is a few steps from the beach and near many restaurants. The rooms have large flat screen tvs with adequate cable. There is free wifi and wired internet. They have a good breakfast with some hot items changing daily. What really makes this place special is the people running it. Although there is no conscierge, the front desk fills in admirably. They are anxious to make your stay pleasant and productive. Review #23:Perfect stop pre-approved by the flight crews! Stayed one night, Oct 6. Arrived early enough to enjoy the clean pool and tasty poolside grilled lunch of cheeseburgers and fries prepared to perfection, a bargain at $8. No South Beach diet, but we were on vacation. True, during the day the jets landing on the adjacent runway will momentarily shake your bones, but they don't fly at night. Took a cab to the fabulous (by any standard) Plaza las Americas Mall for the highest quality shops we've seen anywhere in the continental U.S., with better prices, too. The Hampton Inn rooms are spacious, safe and clean with very comfortable beds and all bedclothes are washed daily. Windows are double-paned to reduce noise, but I would request a room on the left wing as you face Reception farther from the runways if you want to nap during the day. Really, at night the noise is not a problem. The airlines would not put their crews there unless it was clean, safe and quiet and a good price close to the airport. Also, 2 blocks away is a fabulous, free, white powder sand beach with gentle waves, possibly the best beach we've ever enjoyed. This place could be a destination unto itself. Lots of good restaurants within safe walking distance. Prefer this to Old San Juan any day. Review #24:I have had several extended trips to San Juan this year, and I will only stay at the Hampton Inn & Suites on busy Isla Verde Avenue. It is close to the airport, where I was working, but also close to the beach and several restaurants, all within walking distance. There are also several other shops nearby for the everyday conveniences. Most nights I didn't even leave the hotel since there is a poolside bar and grill outside. Even though I was there on business, my evenings felt like a vacation. This hotel has all the Hampton Inn conveniences while maintaining the lad back Caribbean vibe. Review #25:Nice and clean, friendly staff, beautiful decor with a tropical theme through out the place. Pool was abit small and loud from the planes, but we wanted to be near the airport. The poolside bar and grill was fantastic thier burgers were nice and juicy with lots of flavor- only 6.50$( came with a side dish) No problems getting a reasonable cab to the airport. A short walk away you can go to the beach. Review #26:We had decided that we wanted to stay an extra night in Puerto Rico to visit more of the island after we completed our Carribean cruise. We found this hotel through hotels.com and carefully read the reviews before we left. Since the overall rating was good, we decided to book. And we were happy to see that we had made the right pick. Check in was fairly quick even though there was a long line-up upon arrival. Parking cost less than $6 tax in for guests.The room was beautifully furnished with top notch furniture and comfortable bedding. The business center had three computers with complimentary internet access (very slow though at times). Complimentary breakfast offered waffles, eggs, sausage, all types of breads, coffee cakes, cereals, fresh fruit, orange juice, and good coffee. Everything was delicious except for the sausage which looked really dry and not too apetizing. Great location, 5 minutes walk from beach and about 15 minutes from airport. Hotel has a beautiful jacuzzi and outdoor pool with pool bar. Pool towels are provided even when we went to the beach. The pool bar also prepared barbecued food and we absolutely LOVED their baby-back ribs made by Jay. Remember that name, cause he is the guy you want behind the grill and who will make the difference in your appreciation of this meal. He is such a pro at this and trust me you won't eat any other ones like these! Chicken burger was also very tasty and juicy as well as their hamburgers. Salad side dish was not very generous, so we ommitted the chips and asked for more greens, which they happily did. Drinks are very cheap. We stayed at a different hotel when we arrived in Puerto Rico the day before our cruise and we were very disappointed, even though the cost was very comparable. So this one is definitely a keeper! Review #27:Clean rooms, wonderful front desk staff, great breakfast buffets. I had one small problem with my phone and one of the maintenance personnel overhead my comment. Next thing I know, he's upstairs fixing the phone! What service! Very personable staff - always friendly and polite. I can't say enough about them. The Tuesday night buffets are okay - get there early because the food does run out! The food by the pool area is good. As with everything in Puerto Rico, make sure you allow plenty of time - it's definitely NOT fast food! Close to the airport, but you can't hear the noise unless you're by the pool. You really can't go wrong here! Review #28:My wife and I went on a cruise and stayed at the Hampton Inn for a few days beforehand so we could see San Juan. The inside of the hotel, especially the rooms, are beautiful. It is a nice looking place and service was good. The breakfast was so-so, not bad, but definitely not great either. My primary reservation with the hotel was the price: 1) Nothing says class like a cock fighting arena outside your window. 2) Going to the beach is a 10 minute walk and once you get there, it is not automatic that you will find a beach chair. 3) A taxi to Old San Juan is $20 each way. We took the public bus for $0.75 each, but it took roughly 50 minutes each way. 4) When at the pool, you could almost feel the wind from the jet engines. None of these are deal-breakers, but I thought the price of $200 a night was a little high (it felt like a $120 hotel). I talked with someone in a nearby restaurant who was at the Courtyard about 5 minutes away, and he paid $20 less a night and was on the beach. If I did this again, I think I would definitely try this next. Review #29:I stayed here for three nights, April 20th to 23rd, 2010. I stayed in room # 333. I paid $ 135 USD per night. This hotel belongs to the Hilton family of hotels. I really enjoyed my stay. My room was a one King bed room. Great bed, clean linen. The room was very clean. I had free WiFi internet in the room. Free breakfast was included in the price. I have read that other guest's paid $ 5 USD for parking. I had a rental car, and, the front desk always validated my parking ticket, everytime I wanted to depart the hotel. I don't think the front desk makes this function known, and, those other guest's probably never asked. The palapa bar out by the swimming pool, is a great place to un-wind every night. They do grill up some nice meals there for you, along with refreshing drinks. The only planes I ever heard taking off or landing, was when I was out at the palapa bar. When in my room, I never heard any jet noises at all. I definately recommend this hotel to everybody. On my future visits to Puerto Rico, I will be booking this hotel again. Review #30:Room is good. (King suite facing pool). Average condition, few amenities (no bar, restaurant, etc...except pool bar w/food outside). Quiet...except for some airport noise and loud voices from adjoining room through closed doors. Typical free Hampton breakfast buffet. However, lousy neighborhood. Run down, dirty streets and buildings. Nearby beach is dirty with piles of sea weed. Next time I would pay the extra for Condado area resort hotel or stay in Old San Juan. It's $50 round trip cab, incl tip to Old San Juan, where all the city's character is. Spend a day touring Old San Juan, impressive castles/forts, neat streets and shops. $19 plus tip to Pan American cruise ship dock from this hotel. Review #31:My wife and I spent a long weekend in Puerto Rico to visit with our son who had been working here for the last several months and to get a break from the cold. We chose the Hampton Inn after reading the reviews here. I have to say that this hotel exceeded my expectations. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast in the lobby each morning was just right, it saved time and money. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I don't know if I would recommend this someone who was looking for more of a resort stay. I think if you came to Puerto Rico and only stayed in the vicinity of the hotel, you would miss a lot of the charm and beauty of the island. We used this as a base to operate from and traveled all over the island. There is a lot at the hotel though; Walgreen's across the street and several restaurants in walking distance. A two block walk to the beach was not a problem. When we went to that beach I noticed a resort with umbrellas and lounge chairs approximately 100 yards from where we set up our towels. I walked over to get a better look and discovered that it was the Ritz-Carlton. I'm certain that none of the people there paid $179 a night to get to that beach. The pool, hot tub and swim up bar at the hotel were great. You could spend your vacation there and have a great time. On Monday we took the 75 cent bus trip to Old San Juan and explored. The desk clerk gave us excellent advise on which bus to take and also told us to take the free trolley to the farthest point out once we arrived at the bus station. That way we could work our way back through the city going downhill. That worked out great. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Review #32:We stayed here for just one night after a late arrival into San Juan. The cab ride from the airport to the hotel was $12-$15. The room was a little small for a Hampton Inn, but still very comfy. We had enough room with our baby's travel crib to use the desk and lounge chair all at the same time. Very comfy bed, great water pressure, & nice continental breakfast. The pool area with bar looked really nice, but we didn't stay long enough to try it. The price was reasonable compared to the other options in the area. Review #33:Stayed here mid Nov and loved it. The outside pool bar has great. The food is outstanding and the drinks were reasonably priced. Room was clean and quiet. Great location walk to beach, walgreens, restaurants. Safe neighborhood. Hotel parking $10 a night Review #34:We have stayed at the Hampton Inn a few times before, and it was always only for a night or two before a cruise. The hotel is nice, but I wouldn't want to stay for longer than a few nights, seeing as there's not a ton to do. The location is pretty good, there are some nice restaurants and a beach nearby. The pool is good. You can get food, like burgers and grilled cheese, from the bar near the pool. There's a hot tub too and lots of chairs to sit on. The rooms are pretty good. They have a good amount of space, we could fit our whole family of five in one room, which had two queen beds and we had a rollaway as well. The first time we stayed here we had a nice view of the pool, the second time we had an ugly view of the parking lot, but we didn't mind much. Breakfast is great. It's free and a buffet is set up so you can get your breakfast in the lobby. They have coffee, cereal and fruit as well as some hot food like sausage and eggs, as well as toast. For other meals you have to eat at the bar by the pool or go to a nearby restaurant. The location was good here, because it was just a short walk to the beach and many restaurants, however it was very close to the airport as well, which is both good and bad. Good because it doesn't take long to get to the hotel, but bad because there are always planes passing by so it's quite noisy. I would recommend this hotel if you need somewhere to stay for a short amount of time before a cruise, or if you don't plan to do much on your vacation. Review #35:Stayed here in March, 2006 The Good: Overall it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice hotel, although its far from a new property. The breakfast ins included and they do a nice job- choice of coffees and tea, fruit, a hot item, cereals, yogurt etc. The business center is a nice plus and offers free printing. The pool is on the small side- but never looked crowded. The people are friendly The not so good: The hotel has suites and standard rooms- I was in a standard room. The furniture is newer, but the rooms themselves are kind of beat up ( some mildew on the over calked bath tub, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd material coming from the piper in the tub, etc.). The hotel is very close to the airport and if you have the windows open you feel like you are sleeping on a run way. As with most Hamptons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this location offers no room service or restaurant- there is however a snack area at the pool- but it closes fairly early. Summary- stay there if the price is right but compare the Marriott Price and Availability first Review #36:I've stayed at dozens of properties throughout the Hilton family, ranging from high-end Waldorf Astoria properties in New York or the Conrad in the Maldives, to not-so-stellar places such as airport Hampton Inns. Because this property was so close to San Juan airport, I was assuming it'd be like your typical airport budget hotel...but was surprised and delighted to see it was not. This property is great --good location, great staff, and nice interiors/rooms --definitely the best Hampton Inn I've stayed at.... and generally nicer than more than 70% of Hilton Hotels I've stayed at. The lobby featured new/modern decor...as did the room. The bed/furnishings were high quality....and the materials in the bathroom (granites and beautiful tile) were too. The room was quiet and very clean --I remarked at how \"fresh\" the room smelled when I first walked in. They provided the typical Hampton Inn breakfast, which included fruits, cereals, carbs, and some hot options which included cheese omelets, bacon, and make-your-own waffles. There was plenty of self-dispensed juice to drink too in addition to coffee. You can eat at table seating, bartop seating, or outdoors by the pool. The pool was nice --large and clean, and featured a swim-up bar to a bar/grill in the rear of the property. The food at the pool bar/grill was top-notch; I was shocked I was eating in a Hampton Inn and shocked I was eating at a pool bar/grill with the type of quality I was enjoying. Bar/grill staff were very friendly. Front desk staff was cheery and helpful. There was an error on my folio at check-out that they promptly fixed. The location is good; a short 2-3 minute walk across the street brings you to the Ritz Carlton, other nearby casinos, or the beach. I felt safe in and around the hotel. Overall, a great stay in a great property with great service. So much so the hotel should bear a more upscale brand than \"Hampton Inn.\" Review #37:I travel to PR several times a year and always stay at the Hampton Inn in Isla Verde. I always have a wonderful experience - the staff are very friendly and helpful (will always point you to a great restaurant or book a local tour), the rooms are large and clean, and the location is excellent. You have a short walk to the beach, a ton of restaurants, and bars. There are several other large hotels nearby (on the beach) that are extremely overpriced and stuffy. I have stayed in a variety of these hotels as well and always have a poor experience. I highly recommend the Hampton Inn! Review #38:The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The whole hotel is clean and pleasant to be in. Parking is an extra $5 a day but that us fair compared to other locations in the area. Breakfast is included but if your kids like cereal ask for it. For those who keep kosher, Chabad is a five minute walk from the hotel. Review #39:Just returned from a quick trip to PR with mom to celebrate her 60th. Love the place and the people. We took a jr. suite facing the pool. We had 2 double cloud 9 beds and a large tv in the bedroom. A nice kitchen area with sink, coffee maker, microwave, and mini frig. We also had a living room with couch, chair, desk/table with 2 side chairs and a large tv. All was clean and very nice. Continental breakfasts w/ 2 hot items (eggs/sausage) were provided until 10 am and coffee/tea provided 24 hours. The breakfast made it easy to get our day started without figuring anything out. Pool and jacuzzi are nice with fluffy towels provided. Staff is friendly - recommending buses, restaurants and even having a few menus on hand. Location is very convenient to the airport and you can walk to the beach in a few minutes (ask staff where best beach is since access is limited due to private bldgs and homes). If you take public bus route A5 into Old San Jan as we did expect at least a 1/2 hour ride with a close up experience to PR and its wonderful and warm people. Great restaurant deli across the street - I know it looks like a diner but it is good. Metropol on the other side of the cockfighting arena next door had wonderful cuban fare and drums located in the Isle Verdre mall (2 o'clock from the Hampton front door) had a wonderful red snapper special as well as PR appetizers. Review #40:This hotel - I think - is supposed to be a business hotel. As a business hotel, it's got some very nice features: 2 minutes from the airport, decent internet bandwidth, a nice business center with 4 HP towers and a laser printer, quick dry-cleaning, in-house coin laundry, quick in-and-out parking, and very close to restaurants. However, the hotel is 2 blocks from the beach. As a result, the clientele is a bit skeevy. Small children in wet bathing suits running wild in the hallways, screaming to all hours. Teen baseball teams creating long lines, noise, and chaos at breakfast. To me, businessmen and vacationers do not make a good mix. But the hotel staff were perfectly bi-lingual (surprisingly rare in Puerto Rico), very cordial and helpful, and I would have to say overall my experience at this hotel was a good one. I think next time I will stay at the Doubletree, which is not near the beach and seems a bit more business-oriented. Review #41:I recently spent 30 days at this hotel. The staff was very accomodating to every need a long term client can have. Great rooms with essentials to survive away from home. Did not use most of the facilities but they all looked clean and inviting. Highly recommended and it is now part of the Hilton family for those of us that like to get points for our stays. Review #42:We had never been to the Isla Verde area but decided to stay there overnight so we would be close to the airport for an early morning flight. We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel's location which was within walking distance to upscale restaurants and casinos. The area felt very safe also. The hotel was very clean, staff very helpful and we chose a King suite overlooking the pool which was fantastic. We did not get a chance to use the pool but it looked very nice. They had a manager's reception in the early evening with drinks and opportunities to talk to the other guests and staff - very nice touch. The breakfast was good and as an added bonus we were at the airport within 15 minutes. Review #43:The staff is great. The rooms are clean and well kept. The breakfast is excellent. The swim up bar and grill is pretty awesome too! If you don't want to pay Old San Juan prices, but want to be close to all the activities this is a great option. The Isla Verde area is great! You are only a 5 minute walk to the beach, a 10 minute drive to the airport, and a 15 minute drive to Old San Juan, plus there are tons or shops and restaurants just a few steps from the hotel. We will certainly be back! Review #44:My wife and I stayed here for one night prior to boarding a cruise. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms spacious and well appointed, and there was plenty to keep us busy on site/nearby (pool, fitness center, beach nearby, plenty of restaurants within walking distance, casinos, shopping, etc). Pool and hot tub were both well maintained and there was a swim-up bar that served drinks and food. The free hot breakfast in the morning was stocked with everything you could imagine for breakfast. Free WiFi too. Only two negatives and both were minor. First, it was right next to the airport and so the noise of planes taking off during the day was a bit distracting. Also, we had no HOT water (lukewarm only) in the morning for showers. Review #45:I am a Hilton HHonors Diamond Member with more than 100 stays per year at the Hilton Hotels, this hotel was the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at, the place seemed like it was from the 1960's, the beds were horrible, the staff's attitude was very conflictive, this hotel should be priced at around $59 per night and not at $189. What a disgrace to Conrad Hilton; the pool, the carpet, the paint, the beds; were all dilapidated. My family and I decided that after a few days, it was time to move on, at which point we advised the hotel and they were insulting by saying \"Well, guess its time to go home, because Puerto Rico is expensive,\" and I responded with \"NO, we are moving to a real hotel, like the Embassy Suites; once we arrived at the Embassy Suites, the hotel manager personally took care of us and gave us the Diamond Member treatment. For a difference of only $20, our family was able to recuperate from the dreadful mistake of staying at the \"Worst Hampton in All of the America's.\" This hotel is probably ok for the flying crew; as they are only in for a night, but not for families. My kids had a wonderful time at the Embassy Suites with a Cascading Waterfall and water toys to pass several hours; also the breakfast and food was far superior to anything served at the Hampton. At the Hampton, the cafeteria or area serving food, closed at around 9p.m., what a disappointment. No more stays at Hampton Inns, neither in Puerto Rico nor anywhere else. Review #46:I chose this hotel because of the location - close to the airport and the beach area. We stayed after our cruise and really lucked out with this place. It was very clean, had friendly and helpful staff, and a great hot breakfast! The pool patio was very clean and inviting, with a hot tub and bar in the same area. Our room was large with two comfortable queen size beds, and the bathroom was also very large and clean. They also provide free internet from either your room or the computer room off the foyer. They are close to a number of restaurants and bars for either local cuisine or your standard North American chains. We two women felt quite safe walking around outside (however, I wouldn't venture down to the beach at night), with many police patrols visible. It's only a $20 taxi ride to downtown Old San Juan. Highly recommended! ! Review #47:We stayed here after our first hotel overbooked and sent us to a dump we refused to stay in- I called this hotel and asked if they had any availability. They had one room to offer and we snatched it up to get out of where we were. We only stayed one night but would stay again. Nice area, comfortable to walk around in at night- rooms were nice, breakfast was good. We didn't spend a lot of time here (late arrival and left San Juan the next morning for Luquillo) but it was a nice hotel. Review #48:We visited this hotel on May 9, 2009. We stayed there because we were taking the Royal Carribean cruise which left the next day. This hotel was beautiful!! It is very clean and the complimentary breakfast was excellent. The staff was very professional and helpful to us. We were very pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Review #49:I've stayed at the Hampton several times over the years on business, as well as some of the fancy hotels nearby on Isla Verde. For a clean and nice place to sleep, as well as a friendly staff, cheap parking and free internet this is the only place in the San Juan metro area that I can recommend. Sure other places are right on the beach, have a fancy pool with $7 cokes and bottles of water, so leave that to the tourists. Lots of flight crews stay here, as well as people coming in early or staying an extra day after a cruise or caribbean vacation while waiting on a flight at the airport (literally right behind the hotel). The staff is extremely friendly and the entire property is very clean, which is a luxury in and of itself in PR. If you are looking for the fancy hotel lobbys, restaurants and expensive restaurants they are all within a 5 minute (or less) walk from the front door. The beach is also 2 blocks away. Just take the side street next to the Walgreens and it drops you right on the same strech of sand used by the Ritz Carlton. This is one of the best Hampton Inns in North America. I'll be back. Review #50:My coworker/friend met me at this hotel to finish the last leg of my solo vacation so I was anxious to have some company. My coworker is a younger person who has limited finances so I was hoping that everything was up to par so that she can enjoy her vacation. We were not disappointed with this hotel. The location was very close to the airport, taxi to the hotel was $12. The hotel staff are very nice and helpful. The hotel, room and grounds are very clean and comfortable. Not on the beach but close enough. Free breakfast was acceptable and satisfying to start the day. Plenty of food places close by. I arrived at 9am and was immediately checked in - no waiting till 3pm. I sure didn't want to haul my luggage around until 3pm. The beds are comfortable and the pillows the best. Free wi-fi either in the hotel or your room Review #51:I was in San Juan for a week for business so I wasn't going to be spending a lot of time at the hotel. I just wanted a clean, comfortable room in a convenient location. The Hampton Inn was perfect. There's plenty of parking which was a big plus and for only $5 a day. The room has a nice big flat screen tv and a refrigerator which is nice as I like to keep cold water and some beer in the room. The desk staff was very helpful in recommending places to eat. The pool area is very nice and very clean. There is a swim-up bar and grill which has very good food. If I go back to Puerto Rico for busniness I'll definitely stay here again. Review #52:It's no 5 star resort if that's what you are looking for. It's intended purpose is that of a typical airport inn and you will find several pilots, flight attendants, and business people staying there. However, it was quite inpressive for the money. The prices are low and for that price the rooms are comfortable, clean and updated, the lobby is nice, nice pool, great location, and friendly staff. My 2 friends and I stayed there for a vacation trip and were very happy. It's a short walk to the beach, restaurants, bars, clubs and casino's. I would stay there again if returning to San Juan. Review #53:Would highly recommend this hotel. We stayed the last night our vacation to be near the airport. The rooms are wonderful, beds are very comfortable, pool area is great. The price was reasonable and the complimentary breakfast is very good. There are restaurants across the street. We only heard the airplanes when we were outside. Review #54:I stayed at the Hampton with my wife, my son and his wife the night before our cruise left port. Other than the double beds being a bit cozy, we had a good stay here. The breakfast in the morning was good and the front desk personel were very friendly and helpful. Review #55:We came in a couple days before a cruise and stayed here. Someone in our group had been there before and recommended it. The rooms were nice and our stay there was pleasant. There was free breakfast in the morning that was very sufficient. One night a neighboring room was having a fight in the middle of the night. We called security and it was taken care of very quickly. There is a Walgreen's within walking distance if you need to buy a few last minute items before cruising. Review #56:I recently stayed here with friends for a bachelorette party. THE GOOD: Rooms are clean, the hotel staff was nice (talk to Omar at the front desk). THE BAD: It is not a beachfront property, so you have to walk 2 blocks to the beach (not bad). The beach within walking distance is dirty (cigerette butts everywhere). I recommend researching where the cleaner beaches are on the island. Additionally, go early for breakfast (they stop replenshing the hot breakfast after 9). THE UGLY: The pool is absolutely disgusting. You cannot even see the bottom on the 3 foot side. There are things floating in there, that make you want to vomit. OTHER TIPS: Cabs are very expensive, so rent a car. You can rent one at the Ritz down the street. Go to El San Juan Hotel & Casino to party / drinks. Their lobby is very lively. Lupi's is the only 24/7 eatery around, its not good, but if you gotta eat, you gotta eat! Definitely go to Old San Juan - the restaurant \"Mira Buena\" is delicious! And also, for authentic local PR food, go check out the food Kiosks on the east tip of the island (30 min drive). I recommend Kiosk #38. Review #57:We stayed the last night of our vacation here. It was very clean and comfortable. A breakfast is included in your rate (cheese omelet ,sausage,bagels,cereal,yogurt,etc.). There was some airport noise due to how close the hotel is to it. Only a 5 min taxi ride away . Also, a 5 min walk to the Isla Verde beach. I would recommend this hotel. Review #58:Second time in 12 months at this hotel and another outstanding stay. Obviously many people want an \"on the beach\" resort, but if you are willing to walk across the street, your savings and satisfaction will be met here! Inexpensive parking, the most friendly front desk staff available, a fantastic poolside grill, clean rooms, linens and comfy beds. This is a fantastic hotel. Breakfast is unbeatable and they change it up daily. The pool grill has fantastic food at a very affordable price for families. Your walk across the street can take you to the Pine Grove area of Isla Verde....go right toward the Ritz resort or the western side near the El San Juan - you must try both sides.......so fun! We can't say enough positive about the Hampton and it's staff. Review #59:This hotel was perfect for what we needed for a pre-cruise stay of one night. After a very long day including 2 flights and lost luggage we were beat. The hotel is close to the airport, there is a pharmacy across the street and a great pool area. It was clean and safe and staff was friendly. The little grill by the pool was awesome and the burgers were delicious. We expected very limited choices but their menu was a lot broader than we expected, including chicken and even, I think, steak. Breakfast was larger than your usual continental type and more than what we needed. We would stay here again. Review #60:The best feature of this hotel is the pool and the breakfast. The pool has a swim up bar but was rarely seen being used during our 10 day stay. The pool area is clean but the lounge chair cushons could be taken better care. The hot breakfast was nice but could offer a few options. The fresh waffles that were offered daily were a nice addition. The fruit was quite sour and the eggs were a bit dry but can't complain too much as there is a larger variety than what Ive had at other hotels. The rooms were clean and housekeeping was there first thing in the morning. The staff was very courteous and professional. I would stay here again. Review #61:Very nice hotel, breakfast buffet included and only $5/day parking. Close to Pueblo supermarket, airport and various restaurants. Good service by the front desk: when I had a problem with the wifi internet, they brought me a regular wired modem. Can be busy at weekends: there was a very long queue at the front desk to check out when we were checking in early. Review #62:Before we were ready to take off on first cruise, we stayed at the Hampton Inn & Suites in Isla Verde. It is well located, being about 15 minutes from the airport and in walking distance to key places in Isla Verde. The front desk staff was very friendly from the first point we arrived. I liked how they had free drinks all day. The interior of the property was nice, but the room was worn around the edges. It was obvious that the lobby and other areas of the hotel were refurbished while the rooms were a bit neglected. However, the room was spacious, and the beds were comfortable. We had a nice view of pool. The free breakfast was a plus and helped to save time since we had a tour of El Yunque rainforest the next morning. On our first day, I really wanted to try the infamous El Churry sandwich, which has three types of meats served from a food truck on Isla Verde street where we where staying. It was a long walk from the hotel through rain and way at the other end. Sadly, when we got there around 4 p.m., the truck was closed. However, that night we walked across the street to another Hilton property, El San Juan Resort & Casino, and caught a free concert featuring the Gypsy Kings. Overall, it was a nice stay at the Hampton Inn and in Puerto Rico. Review #63:Stayed here for a night while connecting flights. Friendly, nice pool where we hung out with the kids, breakfast was good, good pool food at the grill, took the family suite which was perfect for us (we're four). Convenient to get to the airport. Supermarket nearby (walking distance). Old San Juan is lovely to visit. Recommend Review #64:Went to the Heineken Jazz Fest and choose to stay here for the good price. Hotel is in a excellent location with Denny's and a CVS across the street. The food from the pool bar was grilled and great. The only complaint I have was that the maid came early in the morning twice and opened the door with a fast knock while we were sleeping. The 2nd time she came back I told her to come back in a half hour. When I left the room all of the clean ladies where in the hallway still working and said hi to us. When we came back to the room 4 hours later the room wasn't cleaned. We had to call the front desk for soap and clean towels. The next day was our check out day and the maid still came knocking on the door early in the morning. Other than that the staff was very friendly! The room we had (453) had water stains on the wall by the door from an apparent leak from the ceiling, but it didn't effect our stay at all. Review #65:We stayed at Hampton Inn for one night pre-cruise. After arriving on a \"red eye\" from the west coast, we were fairly tired and ready to relax a bit. Even though it was only 11AM, the hotel staff was kind enough to allow us to check in early and gave us our keys right away. The hotel was clean and while this is no \"resort\", it has everything you could need for a short stay of 1 or 2 nights. The pool is small but nice and even has a swim up bar at one end. The bar cooks burgers, hot dogs and few other local items. It's a great little area just just relax and enjoy the tropics after a long flight. The rooms are fairly well kept and the bedding was clean. Even though it's located pretty close to the airport, noise was not a factor while inside. While at the pool, the planes could still be heard, but it's a momentary distraction at best. The hotel has a couple of other nice features like a business center that had 5 computers (great for emailing friends/family and gloating that you have arrived in the Caribbean) and also a self-serve breakfast in the morning. Breakfast alone probably saved the three of us $40. While the hotel is not located very close to Old San Juan (about 15 minutes away), taxi service was easily available. Also, since Hampton is close to the airport, the taxi from the airport was not overly expensive. There are plenty of restaurants and casinos nearby. Our only wish would be that the hotel had an airport shuttle. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and it's perfect for pre or post cruise nights. Hampton Inn is a good choice for keeping your budget in check, but still getting a few perks. Review #66:Having stayed at this hotel a few years back and having a positive experience, we booked a pre-cruise overnight for this trip. Again, we were not disappointed. The hotel is clean, has a nice pool with a swim-up bar, free wi-fi, and a great complimentary breakfast. It is within walking distance of the beach, casinos, restaraunts, and various stores. It is about 5 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from the cruise port. Review #67:This is a very good hotel and an incredible value. Traveling with hungry teens, the breakfast bar was great for stretching our meal budget. We stayed in a two room suite which was great for a week long stay, so we would not tripping over one another. The beds were incredible... crisp and clean with two choices of pillows (soft & firm). The overall hotel (both interior and exterior)was nicely decorated and the pool area was lovely (especially at night). The hamburgers at the poolside grill were delicious ( a big hit with my teens) and convenient. The hotel is within walking distance of the beach, a Walgreens, a city bus stop, and literally dozens of resturants. We ate at several of the local ones, and never had a bad meal. Only a few details kept this hotel from getting a perfect mark...First, we had water leak from the room above us (in the shower) but someone came up right away to address it and clean up, but it was still a small annoyance and the plumbing needs to be addressed before it becomes a regular occurance....they could stand to vaccum the hallways/rooms and pool a little more often, and they should paint the interior room doors (they were off-white) and refinish the bathtubs. As these areas need some attention, overall though this is a solid establishment. Review #68:My husband and I just arrived home after a wonderful week at the Hampton Inn & Suites in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This hotel is absolutely the best we have stayed at. Its very cozy and has a home feeling. The customer service staff is the greatest! We miss it already and if you're looking for a nice place to stay, please try the Hampton Inn. Thank you to all the ladies in customer service. They are the best! Review #69:We stayed for one night pre-cruise and used points to pay for the room so the price was right. Otherwise it would have run us about $250 for the night. The front desk staff was very helpful, the room was nice and clean and there were many places to walk out for dinner. The pool area is attractive - decent sized pool, small hot tub, comfy loungers and a good bar/grill (I also agree the hamburger is excellent). You do hear noise from the airport when the planes take off (rendering conversation impossible for 30 seconds at a time), but it's no big deal. Review #70:This was our third stay at the Hampton Inn this year and my second review. I had to take one star off of the previous review due to a backslide in the housekeeping department. Upon first checking in for this stay we were assigned a room upstairs. The room looked like it had been cleaned and made up properly but upon inspection, I noticed that one of the beds had small black hairs all over it. I went downstairs and they immediately assigned me another room, this one being on the first floor. All was well the first night but again the housekeeping showed signs of weakness. Two of the four nights we were there we did not receive any washcloths. One of the nights our clean bath towels were draped over the toilet tank instead of on the rack...disgusting. It was also obvious that our sheets were never changed for our four night stay. I find that unacceptable as well. We leave tips every day and are very tidy in our room because we do not like to be a burden on the staff but this was obviously not appreciated. Other than those issues, the hotel is still a good bet. They are under renovation right now but travelers are not inconvenienced by it at all. I believe the renovation is supposed to be completed by the end of November. The free breakfast has been moved from the lobby to a conference room down the hall. Parking is still a bargain at $5 a day. (Other hotels charge between $15 - $20.) The Wifi signal also seemed stronger than on my previous visit in June. I did not have any trouble connecting with my mobile device. This hotel is frequented by many business travelers and airline staff as well. It is not a resort but a solid hotel in the Isla Verde area. I hope they address the housekeeping issues. Review #71:I would like to inform you of our recent stay at the Hampton Inn Suites Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I reserved 3 suites. We had one suite reserved for 5-28-10 the suite was ready and my sister could immediately check in. We had a connecting suite for 5-29-10. When my wife and I arrived we learned that one of our suites were accidentally booked the prior day. We spoke with the Manager, who apologized for the mishap and advised that she would do her best to accommodate us. Not only did she do her best she went above and beyond and we just wanted to let everyone know that we had a wonderful time at the hotel, we were very satisfied with the rooms, the staff was great, the free breakfast was an added treat, the food at pool side was fantastic. We look forward to our vacation there next year. I am so glad my wife booked reservations at this hotel. A few of our family and friends stayed at some of the pricier hotels and they informed us that the service was not that great. Again, I would like to thank the staff at the Hampton Inn & Suites for their exceptional hospitality. Review #72:We came into Peurto Rico late and had previously booked another hotel. The hotel we had chosen was not going to work so we called a travel agent and she booked us at the Hampton. The first three nights our air was not working and we had someone come and fix it however it did not work. The phone in our room was also out of order. They had attempted to fix it but that did not work. We had a wedding to attend and we called again about the air and someone from the front desk came up to see that it was very warm and went ahead and switched us to a new room. We were late to our wedding due to switching rooms 2 hours prior to the wedding. The pool was a beautiful place to be. The airplanes were loud but tollerable. However people were constantly having to ask for towels. The bar by the pool had wonderful burgers available all day. On our third day the bar ran out of Corona, Nanchos, limes, and Medalla. This to me was frusturating. Some people go on vacation to sight see and others go to lay pool side and soak up the sun and just be free of a schedule and with these luxuries missing that is not easliy accomplished. The hotel was a very nice place to stay and I would recommend it. I feel that they really need to be more orgainized and on top of things after all you are not spending $1900.00 for two beds and a nice shower. We were compt one night and a rollaway bed. To me that is just not right when they clearly say Hampton Inn 100% Gurantee. Review #73:We stayed here prior to a cruise as we had last year.Following our earlier stay I gave a generally positive review of this hotel (on February 13, 2006) except for the malfunctioning air conditioning unit for which we were given a suitable adjustment (we were compted). No such problem this time as every thing was fine, No airport noise in the room, the pool was great, the area has a lot to offer as far as restaurants etc. This is not a fancy hotel , but a Hampton INN and one of the better ones at that. One criticism I have is the price of ALL of the hotels in San Juan which have been creeping upward in each of the past 5 years I have been visiting San Juan. I believe an AARP rate of $200 is too expensive for this hotel just as the $300-$500 rates are too expensive for the fancier hotels nereby that were in the $200 plus range only a few years ago.. Review #74:Before I even begin to review this hotel, I have to commend the staff at this hotel. Let's be honest, we all well know that Hampton Inns are in the lower spectrum of the Hilton chain. That is no secret, and this hotel does not deviate from the obvious. So, what separates one chain from another is its staff and the little things that people do to make your stay memorable, comfortable and in this case (with hurricane Irene in tow) bearable. With more than a million people in Puerto Rico without electricity and some even without water, the Hampton Inn in San Juan, kept its composure and more importantly, electricity, water, food, entertainment and surprisingly enough, internet service as well. People were fed, attended to and serviced with a smile. Rooms were clean and everything in my room was in perfect order. Remember that the people who work at the hotel are residents of the island and them too, had no power or water. They showed up and displayed their best. The hotel offered a very nice breakfast, had DVD movies showing at the lobby and kept the small but adequate fitness room operating so that people would have a choice and avoid \"cabin fever\". The hotel is relatively a short walk to the beach which normally I would had checked out. I hope this comment gets to everyone at the hotel and most importantly, to the powers to be and recognize these wonderful people that pulled it together in the face of adversity. Review #75:We stayed here for 2 nights after a trip to Culebra before flying back to Florida. We found the hotel to be very helpful, allowing us to check in early and giving various directions when needed. The room was spotlessly clean and we paid $127 a night. We got a ground floor room which had TV with cable(BBC World News was nice for us Brits), huge bed, free WI FI, coffee maker but no fridge or microwave. The breakfast was very good and there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance. There's a bus stop opposite the hotel where 75 cents gets you to old San Juan and the beach is a 5 minute walk away. Overall, very nice with no problems encountered. Review #76:We stayed at the Hampton Inn on Isla Verde for 7 nights. The suite was a little smaller than Hampton Inns we've stayed at in the states, but they provided us with two cribs for our baby and toddler and everyone fit fine. The pool was great, we couldve spent our whole vacation there, and only crossed the street to go to the beach once. There is a lot of shopping in walking distance for the needs of a family- Walgreens, grocery stores. The free breakfast at the hotel was wonderful, the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms clean. The nearby airport was very loud though, and the hotel is located on a very busy street. Review #77:After reading many good reviews, we used Honors points for a free night before a flight back to Texas. This was the best decision we could have made. The front desk staff were all wonderful. When we checked in, we asked for a room with 2 beds rather than one. Not only were we given this change, but we were also upgraded to a suite. The room was immaculate and had every ammenity anyone could want. We used our room towels for the pool & upon heading back to our room, we asked for more towels. The towels arrived immediately after we got to our room. The pool was nice as was the pool swim up bar. We decided to go to Metrapol for dinner (good choice) but we were told by 3 other guests that the hamburgers were the best they had ever had....no exceptions. One guest said that he had been there 3 days and had eaten hamburgers at the pool bar 4 times! We heard a plane when we were in the pool. It did require that we stop our conversation for about 15 to 20 seconds. We did not consider this a major inconvenience. We never heard anything when we were in our room. Review #78:Stayed at the Hampton Inn one night pre-boarding Royal Caribbean. Quick $10 cab ride (+ $1/bag) to hotel. Then $19 cab ride to Pan American pier. Dropped our bags off at ship and took another cab to Old San Juan for $15. Wish we had more time in San Juan to visit more attractions. Cabs are zoned and accessible Review #79:My boyfriend and I booked the Hampton Inn for 2 nights pre-cruise. We were very happy with this hotel. The price was much cheaper than most other hotels in the area. Though the area is expensive as a whole. The hotel was clean, the bed was very comfortable, the breakfast was better than adequate, the pool bar area & grill were very nice also. The burgers are huge and juicy. We walked about a block or 2 to Isla Verde beach which was very nice. We also took the bus into Old San Juan. You catch it out front for .75 cents. I would not suggest it. Pay the extra money and take the cab. The bus was packed wall to wall people and the driver had people flying all over the place because he drove crazy. It also took triple the time as the cab ride home. We waited at least 30-40 minutes for the bus to pick us up also and the locals told us that is the norm because the drivers get paid either way so have no incentive to be on time. We did not have any problems with air conditioning in our room. Ours worked very well. It was freezing in the room. We also had no problems getting pool towels. They had an area at the pool whee u get get towels/dispose of towels. The grill outside does run out of things (certain beer,etc) but we just chose something else then. All in all we had a very good time here and would stay at the Hampton Inn again. Review #80:The location of this hotel is very good (assuming you have a car) and parking is $5.00/night which is very good. However, the rooms are worn down and not very clean. The sheets look old and with stains. It has a free breakfast, but it is clearly food that is tailored to the American tourist (e.g. Bagel with cheese/bacon/pizza souce on top, Muffins, etc... (thought it had fruits, which was good). In general, this hotel it's simply too expensive for what it is. Review #81:I have stayed at many Hilton-owned San Juan Hotels and I was so pleased to find that this Hilton run Hampton Inn has the same high Hilton standards. Wonderful staff, clean rooms, plentiful breakfast and most of all, a really nice crowd of people! I love that this is a non-Casino hotel, but there are many casino's nearby if that's your thing. I found it easy to take the bus to/from Old San Juan from here and it's literally across the street from the beach but their pool was a quiet beautiful spot. I will definitely return!!! Book a room here without hesitation, you'll be pleased! Thank you Front Desk, Bell staff, Housekeeping and Breakfast staff --you are really doing a great job!! ! Review #82:I stayed here several times. It is far the best hotel in the Isla Verde area. The airport is right behind the hotel. The only blemish. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is really good. I will absouletly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the San Juan Review #83:Would definitely stay here again. Great linens and bed! You can eat your complimentary (nice, large selection of items) breakfast outside by the pool if you like. Fairly expensive, but all the hotels are. A selection of restaurants within a few blocks that you can walk to. Good beach also within walking distance. You can walk to a bustop that will take you to Old San Juan (about 45 minutes) for $.75 exact change. Taxi to airport was about $16.00+ - seem to have a standard rate, same each way. Review #84:We were able to get a great rate on a king suite back in November. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The room had two HDTVs and separate sleeping and living/dining areas. Parking was free since the gate was malfunctioning. Breakfast was okay, but was for gringos. Our only real incident was that or toilet got backed up one afternoon, but maintenance and housekeeping dealt with it right away. Review #85:The staff at the hotel was great! Anytime we needed directions or suggestions they were happy to help. The room was clean and updated, more then we expected. The breakfast every morning was definitly a plus. Safe and fun. Will definitly stay agian. Review #86:Our room had a water leak and they moved us down the hall.The breakfast was OK but on the way back to room, a large roach crossed in front of me.The location was good but it rained and the water flooded the exit of parking lot.Pool was very small,no hot tub. Review #87:This is a nice hotel and is currently undergoing some renovation/improvements (as of 10/2011) so it should be even nicer, BUT that won't change the fact that this hotel is in a strange, cramped, and less than \"resort like\" neighborhood. Right next to a cock fighting arena, it is difficult to see unless you know exactly what you are looking for. I had gone to the Hampton website numerous times before our trip, but when driving in the neighborhood of the hotel I missed it twice while driving right past it. The hotel does not offer a shuttle so you will pay $10 for a taxi from the airport. The breakfast was great. The pool is nice but VERY busy. Review #88:Visited San Juan this past weekend and I must say that this hotel is awesome. It was very clean, affordable, attractive and the staff was professional. Room was nicely decorated, always filled with fresh towels and linen. The bed was sooooo comfy!!! The pool bar is the best. The price of food and drinks at the poolside bar is definetely affordable and great. (Try the grilled chicken breast and the prime ribs). The computer lab is clean, nice and free with internet. The staff was always attentive to every need, friendly and professional. It is centrally convienient to restarants, walgreens, a supermarket, casino's and most all 2 blocks away from the beach!!!! The breakfast was not the greatest, but was ok. Consider Dennys for breakfast which is located across the street on the second day of your stay or wait until lunch time and get food at the pool bar... The only thing i would recommend is The walls in the bedrooms just need a lil touch up with painting. Improve the breakfast choices. Review #89:Recently stayed here for a week, and had a very good time. We arrived early in the morning, and they were very accommodating, letting us check in early. We had a suite with a king bed, and it was very comfortable, had very good sleeps. Every time we went down to the front desk to ask about a restaurant or something, they were very helpful and sure to make sure we had everything we needed.The continental breakfast was good too. Overall we had an excellent stay! ! Review #90:We stayed at this Hotel after we came back from our cruise and this place was very nice. When we got there the rooms were not ready (2 rooms) but it wasn't a very long wait for our rooms. While we waited they stored our luggage for us and told us we could use all the facilities, pool etc. It has a beautiful pool area with a swim up pool bar & grill you can eat at. The prices were a bit high but the food was good. The rooms were nice, clean and fresh. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This Hotel is across the street from the beach but you just have to walk across the street to the beach and it is handy to the airport, just a few minutes away. There is a Walgreens across the street and just up the street of course is Chili's. Very good place to eat. The Hampton has a continental breakfast but we didn't get a chance to try it because our flight left early in the morning. All in all this was a nice place and I would definitly stay there again. Wish we had booked here before the cruise instead of the ESJ. Review #91:I stayed at the Hampton inn for 7 nights & I loved it! It was nice, quite, & relaxing. The hotel was VERY clean & the rooms were huge. The hotel is positioned in a good spot on the strip so you can walk to different local places. As for the airport noise, you only hear it by the pool & not in your room..BUT you will hear that same noise at any other hotel on that same strip! Trust me, I went visited other hotels. Bottom line, stay here! The food is good, the staff are nice & accomadating, & it's a lovely place. I will stay there again. Review #92:Stay at the Hampton Inn for 4 days and 3 nights. My husband and I went to PR for his 30th birthday. Arrived at the airport 1 hour before the Hotel staff kindly allowed us to check-in early. The Hotel is modern and I think the the atomosphere is very relaxing. The hallway on the floor that we stayed on was never loud it was quiet. Breakfast was excellent and the staff their made sure your needs were met at breakfast time. The pool and hot tub are clean and fun. Towel were provided in the pool area. The beach is a short walk away. DO NOT get a rental car because everything is nearby. The bus is safe and it cost $0.75 to get to Old San Juan and $0.75 back. Very cheap compared to $20 the taxi cost one way. The Casino was modest size and I got luck while there. The night club with the EL San Juan Hotel and Casino is upscale and very nice $20 to get in. Prefect location everything is withing walking distance. Will only stay at this Hampton Inn Next time I travel. Review #93:On arrival, we were warmly welcomed by Naomi at the Front Desk, who was very attentive and helpful. She quickly browsed the system and offered us two options for accommodation and gave a summary of an excellent special that was currently on for the King room which had a sitting area as well. Excellent upsell because the room was very spacious and clean for just an additional US$10. Naomi knew her stuff - in both English and Spanish! The facilities were very well kept and the Housekeeping was outstanding. The room was ready right away, which is always a plus. The complimentary breakfast was good and other bonuses like newspapers were readily available. It would be an excellent choice for business travellers, but is equally suitable for couples and families. Excellent surroundings, helpful and well-informed team members and good location make this hotel an excellent choice in Puerto Rico. Review #94:Three friends & myself stayed for 1 comfortable night prior to our Princess Cruise. The staff were very friendly & helpful. The location is excellent . Across the road is a pharmacy , grocery shop & a couple of blocks away is the beach although the pool was just fine. We enjoyed a typical Puerto Rican & reasonably priced meal restaurant in a strip mall across from the extremely expensive Intercontinental Hotel . Then we went next door to our restaurant for Ice Cream. The queen beds were definitely comfortable & we slept well . Review #95:Hotel stay was good till a storm came which knocked out the cable and forced me, my wife and 7 month old son to stay in the room and do nothing, not even internet, they say high speed online but your better off not even using it. Was forced to go to the hotel up the street were family was staying (by the way they had no problems during the 3 day storm, cough cough Embassy Suits), so we could actually keep track of the wether (found out a tornado had passed threw). On the 3rd day (today) with no cable or \"internet\" I asked if we could be compensated at all, their answer was they have dvd's. I know no one wants a storm to pass through and mess things up, but come on are you really not going to compensate me paying $130 a night for half a room, take some money off at lease. But thats ok I'll be calling the higher ups in the morning. Review #96:My family stayed overnight before our cruise the next day. This hotel is bigger than the usual Hampton Inns we have here in mainland. The lobby is spacious. And the staff were smiling and willing to help. The room I chose was the suite since there were 3 of us. I was suprised when we entered as the room looked like that of the Embassy Suites. It was just refreshing. The casinos, Walgreens, and restaurants are just across the street. The neighborhood was safe to walk around 9 pm. It is very close to the airport. But there is no shuttle service. I like this hotel and I don't mind coming back. Review #97:I was really surprised. This is not your ordinary Hampton Inn. For instance, there's a big pool, with a pool side bar and grill (open to at least 21:00). They serve real drinks, and grill big burgers, skirt steaks, and prepare other full meals. The place seemed more like a small resort than a \"room only\" hotel. This Hampton is located on a good street, with lots of outside restaurants and bars, all within walking distance. It's close to the airport as well. I would be happy using this hotel for a longer stay. Review #98:We flew from Vieques to San Juan the day before our flight home to the US and stayed in the Hampton Inn while in San Juan. The hotel was great!! The room was clean and comfy, the breakfast and dining area was lovely and the pool was fantastic! Also having the pool bar and grill was a nice relaxing end to our vacation before an early flight home the next day. It is close to SJU airport so you do hear the planes when outside but not from the rooms. I slept great! Also is very close to everything so we walked to dinner and around downtown. Will absolutely stay here again. Review #99:Our family stayed here pre-cruise and post-cruise. It was quite convenient and close to the airport and port. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast had a lot of choices, as are Hampton Inn breakfasts. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and well maintained. The pool area is nice. I used the business center, has updated computers and free use of the printers which I used to print boarding passes. However, I was very disappointed with the rooms, they were not clean, dark and had a musty odor. The bathrooms were not clean as one would expect. We stayed in a suite and the wet bar area was very unclean. The tiles on the bathroom had mold. I felt disgusted while showering. Both times I stayed there, I felt the same way. The airplane noise was not a problem, could not hear it in the rooms. I was very disappointed with this Hampton Inn solely due to the accommodations, after all that is the most important part of the stay. I will not stay there again. If you are looking for a pre-cruise stay I suggest you stay in Old Town San Juan. The beach across the hotel and down a street was nothing to write home about.", "source": "review_summ", "evaluation": "human"}
