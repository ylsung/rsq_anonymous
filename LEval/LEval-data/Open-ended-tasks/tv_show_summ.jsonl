The father is my brother.\nNurse: (not sure what to do with that) Okay...\nRachel: I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!\nJoey: Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?\nPhoebe: Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe.

Your cab left when ours did!\n(There's a pause as they figure out what to say.)\nMonica: Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.\nChandler: That's right.\n(Both Rachel and Ross stare at her for a moment.)\nRachel: You-you're not wearing a jacket.\nMonica: Oh man!

Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?\nPhoebe: No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?\nFrank: Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.\nChandler: Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.\nFrank: Yeah.\n[Scene: The waiting room, Monica and Joey are sitting there.]\nRachel: (entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.\nJoey: Oh my!\nRachel: They're male nurses.\nJoey: Not in my head.\nRachel: Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?\nMonica: Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think so.\nRachel: What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.\nMonica: Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.\nRachel: What?\nMonica: Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?\nRachel: Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.\nJoey: (in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...\nRachel: Joey, how do you make that dirty?\nJoey: Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad...\n[Scene: The delivery room, Chandler, Frank, and Ross are with Phoebe.]\nJoey: (entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA Today and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... (Throws the paper away to reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera in it.)\nPhoebe: Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either--Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.\nRoss: Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?\nJoey: Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.\nChandler: Really? Male nurses?\nJoey: Yeah, I was bummed too.\nChandler: So they're going on dates? When?\nJoey: I think Saturday--(groans in pain again).\nFrank: (To Phoebe) What's with him?\nPhoebe: Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.\nDr. Harad: (entering) Okay!\nPhoebe: Hey.\nDr. Harad: Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.\nChandler: This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?\nDr. Harad: Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.\nChandler: All right.\n(Dr. Harad exits.)\nFrank: It's not that weird, is it?\nPhoebe: It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!\nRoss: To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...\nPhoebe: (interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!\nRoss: Again, it's not that he...\n(Phoebe fakes pain to get Ross looking for another doctor.)\n[Scene: The waiting room, Chandler is looking for Monica.]\nChandler: (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!\nMonica: Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.\nChandler: Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.\nMonica: Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.\nChandler: Fine! Maybe I will too!\nJoey: (entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)\n[Scene: The delivery room, Ross has returned with another doctor. This one, is well, younger.]\nRoss: Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.\nPhoebe: Hi! And you're going into what grade?\nDr. Oberman: Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early...\nPhoebe: (interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.\nDr. Oberman: Oh no, I'm fully qualified to...\nPhoebe: Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!\n(He runs out and Frank watches him go.)\nFrank: Oh cool! You made him cry!\n[Scene: Another hospital room, Joey has now been admitted and his doctor is about to break the bad news to him, Monica, and Chandler.]\nJoey's Doctor: Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.\nJoey: Umm, well, what else could it be?\nJoey's Doctor: It's kidney stones.\nJoey: Or?\nJoey's Doctor: Kidney stones!\n[Scene: The delivery room, Dr. Harad is back and checking on Phoebe.]\nDr. Harad: All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.\nPhoebe: They are. Why?\nDr. Harad: They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.\nPhoebe: Happy birthday!\nDr. Harad: Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. (Phoebe nods in agreement as he leaves.)\nRachel: Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.\nPhoebe: I know, it is.\nRachel: Yeah!\nPhoebe: Can I tell you a little secret?\nRachel: Yeah!\nPhoebe: I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)\nRachel: Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: The delivery room, continued from earlier.]\nRachel: Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!\nPhoebe: Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!\nRachel: Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!\nPhoebe: Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?\nRachel: Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.\nPhoebe: Oh, just ask him!\nRachel: Me?!\nPhoebe: I can't ask him!

I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!\nPhoebe: You're right.\n(There's an awkward silence then suddenly Phoebe gets an idea.)\nPhoebe: Tell him it's for you.\n[Scene: Joey's room, his doctor, Chandler, and Monica are there.]\nMonica: Feeling a little better sweetie?\nJoey: Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.\nMonica: Me too.\nRoss: (entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?\nJoey's Doctor: Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...\nJoey: (interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option--what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are you crazy?!\n[Scene: The delivery room, Rachel and Frank are there.]\nPhoebe: (To Rachel) So did you ask him?\nRachel: No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.\nPhoebe: Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.\nDr. Harad: (laughing) Oh Fonzie.\nRachel: Y'know who I always liked? Mork.\n(Dr. Harad drops what he's doing and stares at her.)\nPhoebe: Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.\nDr. Harad: Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.\nRachel: Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?\nDr. Harad: Yeah, that's right.\nMonica: (entering with Chandler) Hey!\nPhoebe: Hi!\nMonica: (To Phoebe) How are you doing?\nPhoebe: Okay, doctor says any minute now.\nFrank: Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?\nPhoebe: Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.\n(A male nurse enters.)\nMale Nurse: Hey!\nRachel: Hi!\nMale Nurse: Rachel.\nRachel: Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. (Mouths \"He's yours.\" to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.\nDan: Nice to meet you.\nMonica: Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!\nChandler: So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?\nMonica: Chandler!\nDan: Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.\nChandler: Oh.\nDan: And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.\nChandler: Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)\nMonica: So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?\nDan: Sure! I'll get somebody to cover my shift.\nMonica: Oh, great!\nChandler: (to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?\nDelivery Room Nurse: No.\nChandler: All right. Very good.\nPhoebe: Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!\n[Cut to Joey's room, who's going throw his own contractions. Plus, he has Ross in a headlock.]\nJoey: Ohh, get these things out of me!\nRoss: Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.\n(Joey starts breathing hard)\nJoey: I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and forth, taking Ross with him.)\nRoss: I do too! I do too!\nJoey: Argh!\nRoss: Argh!\nJoey: Argh!\nRoss: Argh!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: The waiting room, Frank is on the phone as Rachel approaches.]\nFrank: Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!

She's gonna make it on time.\nFrank: Yeah.\nRachel: Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?\nFrank: (laughs) Not to me.\nRachel: Yeah, fair enough.\n[Scene: The delivery room, later on, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, and Frank are there as Dr. Harad is checking out Phoebe.]\nDr. Harad: Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.\n(They all kiss her and wish her luck.)\nMonica: Bye Dan!\nDan: Uh, bye Monica.\nChandler: Bye, momi-moo.\n(Everyone except Frank leaves.)\nDr. Harad: All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.\nPhoebe: What is that?\n(Dan turns on the TV and the Happy Days theme song comes on.)\nPhoebe: Oh my God!\nDr. Harad: Oh, no-no-no, it's a good one! Fonzie plays the bongos. All right, are you ready? It's time to start pushing.\n[Cut to Joey's room, his doctor and Ross are there.]\nJoey's Doctor: Are you ready? It's time to try peeing. (Joey makes a face like he is trying to pee.) Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! It's almost time to try peeing. (Points at the bottle Joey is to pee into.)\n[Cut to the delivery room.]\nDr. Harad: Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!\nDan: I see the head.\nFrank: Yes, it has a head!\nDr. Harad: All right. Keep pushing! Come on!\nFrank: I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.\nDr. Harad: All right. Here's your first baby.\n[Cut to the waiting room, a triumphant Frank rushes in.]\nFrank: YESSSSS!!!!!

Leave me alone.\nFrank: Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!\n(Phoebe screams in pain, and Frank screams with her.)\n[Cut to the waiting room, a twice triumphant Frank returns.]\nFrank: Yeah!! Little Leslie is here! We got another one! Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children. How scary is that? (He returns to the delivery room.)\n[Cut to the delivery room, Phoebe is at it for the last time.]\nFrank: Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!\nDr. Harad: All right, he's coming. He's coming!\n(They both stare at the newborn.)\nFrank: Hey, where's his thing?\n[Cut to the waiting room, a thrice triumphant Frank returns again.]\nFrank: Chandler's a girl!\nChandler: Oh God, kindergarten flashback.\nFrank: They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!\nChandler: Okay, keep saying it!\nAlice: (running in from the elevator) Am I too late?!\nFrank: No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.\nAlice: We have our babies?\nFrank: Yeah.\nAlice: (Starting to cry) Oh, we have our babies.\n(They hug. And quickly that hug turns into a heated make out session, right there on the waiting room couch. Chandler, Rachel, and Monica quickly make their exits.)\n[Scene: Joey's room, he is recovering from his birth.]\nJoey: Oh my God.\nRoss: You did it, man.\nJoey's Doctor: Would you like to see them?

Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing s*x and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.\nMonica: I think you're better than you think you are.\nChandler: Really? Okay, so...\nMonica: (interrupting) Know when to stop.\nChandler: Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?\nMonica: Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.\nChandler: Right!\n[Scene: The delivery room, everyone except Rachel is there.

It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.\nAll: Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.\n(They hand her the babies and leave them alone.)\nPhoebe: So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)\nEnding Credits\n[Scene: The delivery room, everyone is hanging out with Phoebe. Frank, Alice, and the kids aren't there.]\nMonica: Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!\nPhoebe: I know.\nRachel: So does it really hurt as bad as they say?\nPhoebe: Yeah. You won't be able to take it.\nChandler: So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?\nPhoebe: They're gonna call her Chandler.\nChandler: That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?\nPhoebe: Works on you.", "source": "tv_show_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

She's a shoe-in.\nEmma: Why don't you run?\nToby: Because it would provoke a rupture in our fragile family dynamic. It's family counseling speak for \"my dad would kill me\".\nManny: So? Get someone else to run.\nJT: Yeah, right. Who'd wanna run for student council? The whole thing's a joke.\nToby: Did u say joke?\nJT: No way, Toby. I am not going a joke campaign.\nToby: Come on, JT. It's the perfect way to stick it to Ashley.\nJT: But this is my first day at Degrassi.\nToby: Exactly. You're in the same boat as a large percentage of the student body. Which is why they'll love you. Come on, JT, this is your once of a lifetime opportunity.\nJT: For you to stick it to Ashley.\nToby: No, for you to practice your stand-up material on a large perceptive audience.\nJT: Keep talking.\nToby: You want to be famous, right? This is instant fame. Just think: assembly the whole school hanging on your every word.\nJT: And you'll do all the work?\n(Toby nods.)\nJT: Deal. Here we are right here. What if I win?\nToby: Trust me. You don't stand a chance.\n[Hallway]\nAshley: The poster's a little low on the left. Just bring it.\nLiberty: Ashley Kerwin. We haven't met. I'm Liberty Van Zandt and I'm running for secretary. We're gonna be a great team. Just think. I'd like to discuss a few ideas so our policies will be in sync. First, I think we should tackle a lack of the school newspaper.\nAshley: Why don't we wait until after the election?\nLiberty: Great. Um, your poster's a little high on the left.\n(She leaves. Jimmy comes up to Ashley and puts his arm around her (which means they're boyfriend/girlfriend))\nJimmy: What was that all about?\n(They walk away.)\n[Classroom]\n(Toby is making copies of something- we see it says JT's name on it, which means it must be posters.)\nMr. S: You do know it's 10 cents a copy?\n(Toby tries to make them stop.)\n[Hallway]\n(Toby's putting up JT's posters.)\nAshley: I'm gonna make so many changes at this school, Terri. And not just superficial stuff. I want the students to feel heard.\n(They stop when they JT's posters.)\nTerri: Uh, Ash....\nAshley: What is that?\nToby: Oh, a poster without your picture on it.\nAshley: JT Yorke. That annoying little friend of yours?\nToby: What's wrong Ashley? Afraid of a little competition?\nAshley: You are so wasting your time. School president is always in 8th grade.\nToby: Well, uh, this year that's going to change.\n(Ashley and Terri walk past Toby.)\nToby: 'Bye, Ashley.\n[Hallway]\n(Someone comes to JT with a camera.)\nBoy: Hey, JT. Why do you wanna run for president?\nJT: Why do I wanna run for president? Uh, that's a good question.\nToby: In one word people: democracy. The backbone of our fine nation.\nJT: Hear, hear!\nToby: He is, people, our great alternative. In a world dominated by cruel selfish 8th graders, JT is our last shining hope.\nJT: I couldn't have said it better myself. Thank you, Degrassi.\n[Outside]\nLiberty: A grade 7 running for president? I wouldn't be caught dead voting for him. Besides, I think Ashley and I, Liberty Van Zandt, will make an excellent team.\n[Another part of school]\nJT: If elected, I, JT Yorke, will do what a real politician would do: absolutely nothing. And, like a true politician, I will accept bribes.\n(Ashley and Terri are watching.)\nAshley: People are actually paying attention to him?\nTerri: He's pretty funny. If you like total amateur humor. You're not actually worried are you?\nAshley: No.\nJT: I, JT Yorke: Unknown, unremarkable...\n[Hallway]\n(Someone with a camera is talking to Emma.)\nEmma: Personally, I think it's great. Grade 7's have just as much right to run for school president as anyone. I'm voting for JT.\n[Outside]\nAshley: Greater representation the school boards.\nTerri: (passing out fliers) And up-to-date recycling programs.\nAshley: I'll even get us a night dance. All it costs is a vote.\n[JT's speech to students.]\nJT: What about the staff washrooms? (It shows Ashley watching) I'll bet you any money that they have softer toilet paper. If you elect me, I'll those staff washrooms, our washrooms. So vote for JT. You'll do the right thing. I know you will. (To Toby) It's working.\nToby: (sees Ashley watching) I know.\nJT: Vote for JT. It'll do you good. You'll love me. Nice to meet you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Kerwin House: Kitchen]\nAshley: Toby Issacs, you shrimp, who are you doing this to me?\nToby: I'm not doing anything. JT's running for president and I'm just helping him out.\nAshley: JT doesn't care about the school.\nToby: How do you know? Guess what: Degrassi doesn't revolve around you. Anyone can run.\nAshley: The guy is an idiot! And he doesn't know anything because he just got there\nAshley's mom, Kate, walks in.\nKate: Ashley, What's the problem?\nAshley: Great. Take his side again. Don't even try to figure out what we're talking about. I mean, I put all my effort into this race...\nToby: There was no race. Now there is.\nKate: Toby, are you running against Ashley?\nAshley: No, his friend, JT, is.\nToby: I'm helping my best friend run his campaign. What's wrong with that?\nAshley: What's wrong is he's only doing it to bug me.\nKate: Come on, Ashley, I'm sure he's not.\nAshley: But Mom....\nKate: Toby has every right to help run his best friend's campaign.\n[The Next Day- Kerwin Bathroom]\n(Ashley, in curlers, knocks on the door.)\nToby: Today's the big day. Written your defeat speech yet?\nAshley: JT is not going to win.\nToby: You wish. Just think: you're about to lose to a 7th grader.\n(Ashley goes in the bathroom.)\n[Degrassi Hallway]\n(Someone is taping Paige.)\nPaige: Hi. My name's Paige + of course Ashley's going to win today. Sure, some students may resent her for being perfect, but, Ashley always get what she wants, so why would today be any different? Actually, I'll tell why today is different. See, I just got these brand new glasses and I think they look rather nice with my outfit, don't you? Oh, and my belt. Please get a close-up of the belt. Thanks. And my new purse so everyone can see all that I own. What do I have in here? This, this isn't mine.\n(The cameraman starts to walk away.)\nPaige: (O.S.) Hello! I'm not done here!\n[Computer room]\n(Toby and JT are on it, checking polls for president.)\nToby: Look at this! You've got as much support as Ashley!\nJT: It's just some stupid poll.\nToby: This is before your speech (show a close-up of the poll: Ashley- 48%, JT- 52%). Forget Ashley. You're on the verge of making Degrassi history! Am I the only one excited here?\nJT: I thought the plan was to make her sweat.\nToby: Exactly! The closer you come to beating her, the sweater she gets.\nJT: Yeah, well, I'm getting pretty sweaty too. Because if I win this thing, I'll have to do a lot of work.\n[Another part of school]\n(Someone is taping Liberty.)\nLiberty: It would be tragic if Ashley lost today. But if she did, and if I, Liberty Van Zandt, am elected as secretary, I would work closely with JT to ensure excellent standards of student government.\n[Hall]\n(JT closes his locker and starts to head to class when Spinner and Jimmy grab him.)\nJT: Uh, hi.\nSpinner: You're coming with us.\nJT: What? What did I do? I'm going to be late for class, you're going to be late for class. That's a lot of lateness. Do you want to get a dentition? I know I don't. What did I do?\n[A classroom]\nAshley is in there waiting.\nJT: Is this about the election? If I promise you something you got a problem with, just tell me and I'll change it. Really, I will\n(They drop him on the floor.)\nAshley: Thanks. That's all for now.\n(They leave. JT gets up.)\nJT: What's going on?\nAshley: Here's the deal: you quit the race for school president and I give you 50 bucks.\nJT: 50 bucks?\nAshley: 5-0. Okay, 60.\nJT: You see, I'd jump at that but I've got this older brother. He just lost the race for school president.\nAshley: 65.\nJT: My parents were shattered. They had to go on Prozac. I can't put them through that again.\nAshley: 80 bucks and that's my final offer.\nJT: 80's good.\nAshley: Glad to hear it. But for that amount, I want a show. I want you to quit in front of the whole school.\nJT: At assembly? Cool. I still get to say my speech.\nAshley: Half now, the rest after. (Gives him the money)\nJT: It was a pleasure doing business with you, Ms. President. (Puts out his hand but she doesn't shake it) I'll go now.\n(He grabs his bag and leaves.)\n[Hall]\nManny: Once the election's over, I head straight home.\nEmma: And avoid Spinner.\n(Spinner comes up behind them and hits Manny with a spitball.)\nManny: Ow.\n(Holds her neck and starts to cry.)\nEmma: Oh, great. Now look what you've done.\nSpinner: I was just kidding around.\nTerri: Wow that's so cool, Spinner. Making a grade 7 girl cry.\nSpinner: Look, I didn't mean to make her cry.\nEmma: Well, you did. Congratulations.\n(Spinner walks away.)\nEmma: It's ok, Manny. He's gone.\nManny: I knew it would work. Always does on my brother.\n(They walk away.)\n[Hall]\n(Toby catches up to JT.)\nToby: She bribed you?\nJT: She paid me.\nToby: It's wrong.\nJT: Wrong? What about this campaign?\nToby: What about it?\nJT: We did this just to get back at your step-sister.\nToby: She's not my step-sister!\nP.A.: Would all candidates please report to the stage?\nJT: Look, if it makes you feel any better, we'll split it. 50/50.\nToby: I don't want her blood money. It's just helping Ashley get exactly what she wants...again.\n[Assembly]\n(Liberty is finishing her speech.)\nLiberty: And in conclusion, I promise that if elected, I, Liberty Van Zandt, will fulfill my responsibilities as student council secretary with enthusiasm and even more enthusiasm. Thank you. (Applause as she sits)\n(Mr. Raditch comes to the mike.)\nMr. R: Thank you very much, Liberty, for that enthusiasm. Next up, our two candidates for school president. Each will have 3 minutes to deliver their speeches and we will begin with, JT Yorke. (Applause)\n(JT goes to the mike.)\nJT: Ladies and gentleman, it's a long year. You gotta vote for me. You need something to laugh at. Now if I could just say a few words about my presidential platform, this speech would be a whole lot shorter. But, seriously, if there's one thing I've learned in my zero years of political experience, well, it's nothing.\nToby: Ashley! (She ignores him) Ashley!\n(She gets up and goes out the door.)\nAshley: What?\nToby: You bribed JT.\nAshley: No I didn't.\nToby: Yes you did. I saw the money. It's corruption.\nAshley: Oh, how thrilling. You learned a new word.\nToby: Oh you want thrilling? Wait'll I go up on stage and tell everyone what you did.\nAshley: But, JT took the money.\nToby: No, he excepted it as evidence.\nAshley: You wouldn't.\nToby: Oh, I will. I'm heading up there and telling everyone what a fraud Ashley Kerwin is.\nAshley: Fine. My life's a disaster anyway. It might as well get worse.\nToby: Your life's a disaster?\nAshley: I want my mom to be happy and I've tired to be nice, but the moment you moved in, everything become all about you.\nToby: About me? Do you have any idea what's it like living in your house?\nAshley: Please! My mom dotes on you. She doesn't care what I feel, as long as you're happy.\nToby: What?\nAshley: And now I can't get away from you. You're everywhere: at home, at school, even in my campaign.\nToby: That's not true...\nAshley: I wanted just one thing that you couldn't take away from me. But you found a way. Please. Before you go up there and publicly humiliate me, just listen to my speech. Then decided if you don't think I deserve to be President.\n[Inside Assembly]\nJT: She's got the looks, she's got the brains, she's got the brains, she's got everything. Don't pity her; pity me. Thank you. Oh, and by the way, I quit the race for school prez. Vote Ashley. (Sits down)\nMr. R: Well that's rather interesting. JT, you sure? (He nods) Well, I still think we'd like to hear what Ashley has to say. Ashley? Ashley? (To JT.) We'll talk later.\n[Outside Door]\nAshley: Please.\nMr. R (O.S.): Ashley?\n[Kerwin House - Outside]\nAshley: No way!\nJimmy: Yeah, whatever, I'm not lying.\nAshley: Yeah, right. Well, thanks, uh, and I'll see you tomorrow. (They hug)\nJimmy: Congratulations, Ms. President.\n(Jimmy leaves. Ashley walks over to Toby, who is sitting at a table.)\nAshley: So, is this what defeat looks like or just guilt?\nToby: Congratulations, Ashley.\nAshley: Yeah, whatever.\nToby: I mean it. Congratulations. You deserved to win.\nAshley: Ok, what have you done with the real Toby Isaacs?\nToby: it's not my fault JT's in trouble for riding the joke campaign. I should've never put him up to it.\nAshley: You're right. You shouldn't have.\nToby: Ash, I'm trying to apologize here. I knew it would drive you crazy. I just couldn't stop myself.\nAshley: You hate me that much?\nToby: Sometimes.\nAshley: I gotta admit sometimes I feel the same way about you. The fact is Toby, we have to live with each other in the same house and that sucks, right?\nToby: You can say that again.\nAshley: But does it have to such this much?\nToby: Maybe not.\nAshley: Maybe not. Are we bonding here?\nToby: Bonding? Us?\nAshley: Well, the first time in a month, I don't wanna rip your eyes out.\nToby: Wow, Dr. Fried would be so proud.", "source": "tv_show_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

We need to find out what you are. We need to be certain you're okay.\nOWEN : Yeah, well it almost sounds as if you care, well done.\nJACK : Until I'm confident you're fit for duty, Martha Jones will replace you as Torchwood's new medical officer.\nOWEN : She's doing all right out of this, isn't she ?\nJACK (stands up) : She's worked out a series of tests and examinations.\nOWEN : And what if I refuse ?\nJACK : You'll be confined to the cells, the tests will be done, and if the results show that you're a danger to the team, appropriate steps will be taken.

Owen doesn't look at him.\nIANTO : I'm gonna need your gun. Owen turns and looks at him. He takes his gun out and reluctantly gives it to Ianto.\nIANTO : And your security pass.

He glances at her, then takes his security pass out and gives it to Ianto.\nOWEN : And how long are Dr. Jones' tests going to take ?\nJACK : As long as they need to.\nOWEN : And what the hell am I supposed to do in the meantime ?\nJACK : We always need someone to make coffee.\nOWEN : Oh, no.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nCLOSE-UP : COFFEE MACHINE\nIanto is at his area at the base of the spiral stairs as he fills up the coffee cup.

Thank you, Owen. Ianto takes the cup away from him.\nIANTO : Do you want a go ?\nOWEN : Ooh, please. Owen turns to try his hand at the machine. Owen grabs the handle. The cups rattle as he tries to get it to work, but it doesn't.\nOWEN : Come on. What's wrong with this ?\nIANTO : You, um... Owen grabs both handles and shakes it. The cups and dishes rattle loudly. Some sound as if they break. He turns and sees Jack and Martha on the stairs watching him. He rests his chin on the machine in humiliation.\nIANTO (quietly) : You okay ? OWEN (sighs and turns around) : What do you think ? I bet you're loving this, aren't you ? It's like you've finally won.\nIANTO : I didn't realize we were in competition.\nOWEN : Oh, come on ! Even Tosh had more of a life than you used to. And now you're always out on missions, you're shagging Jack and I'm stuck here making the coffee.\nIANTO : It's not like that. Me and Jack. Ianto goes to the machine and fixes a cup of coffee.\nOWEN : Yeah, yeah... You and Jack. Gwen's getting married. Martha's got her bloke. God, even Tosh had Tommy. This is really sh1t ! Ianto goes about his business.\nIANTO : We've all gone through sh1t. I've seen you dissect alien corpses. I've seen you save so many lives. Are you really going to let this beat you ? He leaves Owen with that.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. THE HUB - AUTOPSY AREA\nOwen is on the treadmill. His image is up on the monitor as Martha tests him. The machine beeps. Owen stops it. He smiles.\nOWEN : So, you're choosing me over the boyfriend ? Owen steps off the treadmill and picks up the barbells. He starts lifting them. Martha goes to the treadmill to check the readings.\nMARTHA : Yeah, that's it. You really don't need to worry, you know, I don't want your job.\nOWEN : Yes, I know. You just find me irresistible.\nMARTHA (rolls her eyes) : Oh, yeah, that's it. Every morning I wake up and think of ways to get you alone like this. (She goes back to the computer). There is no sign of any muscle decay. You're in great shape, as ever.\nOWEN : Hmm, no use coming onto me, Jones. I'm a changed man.\nMARTHA : And... um, no stiffening anywhere ?\nOWEN : Well...\nMARTHA : Just answer the question.\nOWEN : No, no signs of rigor mortis. Owen puts the barbells down.\nOWEN : So, if I keep up the exercise, I won't atrophy ? She appears with the hand-held monitor and scans him.\nMARTHA : Yep. And bonus, definitely looks like you're not going to age either. There's no further sign of cell mutation. You're a hundred percent human. (She turns the monitor off). A hundred percent Owen. Owen nods. The intercom beeps.\nGWEN (from speaker) : Hi, Martha. Meeting in the boardroom. Can you come down ?\nOWEN : You'd better go... Doctor.\nMARTHA : What about you ?\nOWEN : Cappuccino with chocolate sprinkles.\nMARTHA (smiles, confused) : What ?\nOWEN : That's what you drink, isn't it ? Suddenly, it's very awkward. Martha turns and leaves. Owen's smile fades.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. THE HUB - CONFERENCE ROOM\nEveryone except Owen is there.\nJACK : Henry John Parker. He used to be a looker. Now he's 80-odd and even I have my limits. The door opens. Owen walks in with a tray of coffee.\nJACK : Your basic millionaire collector of alien hoo-hah.\nOWEN (quietly) : Didn't we file him in the \"mostly harmless\" category ? He puts a cup down in front of Ianto.\nMARTHA : So, what's the problem ? Owen continues setting coffee cups down on the table.\nTOSHIKO : I detected this at 5:17 this morning. Parker's house. There's an energy spike coming from it. I've never seen anything like it before.\nGWEN : Okay. So, the big question is, what's our Mr. Parker gone and found this time ? Gwen and Ianto quietly switch coffee cups as Owen heads to the back of the room.\nMARTHA : Why ? Do you think he's a threat ?\nGWEN : Well, he hasn't been up until now. (Owen wipes his tray as he listens). He's a bit Howard Hughes. We know he's there, we know he's not a threat. But as the story goes, he hasn't left the house since his wife died. Nobody's seen him since 1986.\nOWEN : We've been monitoring Parker for ages. There's nothing to be scared of is there ? Owen quickly sits down at the table with the others. There's a brief awkwardness with him being there when he's not supposed to.\nIANTO : Unlike, say, Tintin ?\nOWEN : Okay ! I never liked Tintin. What ? He's weird. He's got a funny face and his hair is just, he's horrible.\nIANTO : I always loved Tintin.\nOWEN : Yeah, well you would. And he never had a girlfriend did he, just the dog. Yeah, so I reckon he was actually shagging the dog.\nGWEN (interrupts) : Okay, meanwhile, back at Torchwood. Alien energy pulse. (to Jack) We've got to check this Parker out, okay ? (Jack nods. Gwen gets to her feet). Tosh, can you get me a complete schematic of the house ? Ianto, find out exactly what he's got. Get me an inventory of everything that he's bought over the last ten years. Martha, can you get a hold of his medical history ?\nMARTHA : Sure.\nGWEN : Okay, let's get to it, guys. As everyone gets to their feet, Jack levels a look at Owen. He then gets to his feet to leave as well. Owen is left sitting at the table.\nJACK (o.s.) : Hey, Gwen, any news on Banana Boat ?\nGWEN : Can you believe it ? Best Man, arrested in Lanzarote.\nJACK : What for ?\nGWEN : Ah, dodgy Cds.\nOWEN (PRE-LAP v.o.) : Worldwide, nearly a million people kill themselves each year. The door closes behind them.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT (PRESENT)\nOWEN : That's almost three times the population of Cardiff. Makes you think.\nMAGGIE : What are you ? Some sort of suicide geek ?\nOWEN : No, just a doctor. In fact, I'm not just a doctor. I'm a bloody brilliant doctor.\nMARTHA (PRE-LAP, v.o.) : I know you are.\nINT. THE HUB - AUTOPSY AREA (EARLIER)\nOwen sits on the table while Martha is working on the computer.\nOWEN : So why are you doing my job ? He absently plays with a scalpel, flipping it and catching it. Martha turns to look at him.\nMARTHA : Because Gwen asked me to.\nOWEN : That's not what I mean.\nMARTHA : Because you died. And because you need help. That's not a bad thing. Well, it's a bad thing that you died obviously, but it's not bad that you need help. If you know what I mean.\nOWEN : You're kinda cute when you babble.\nMARTHA : And you're kinda cute when you're not chucking a scalpel about.\nOWEN : But I'm making the sodding coffee ! (He stands up. Martha goes back to typing on the computer). I mean, come on, won't your bloke be missing you ? How about Jack ! Has he seen Jack ? They always get jealous when they meet Jack.\nMARTHA (irritated) : Owen, I don't want your job. I just want to do mine.\nOWEN : Okay, I'm dead, but I am one hundred percent human. I'm fine.\nMARTHA : You've sliced your hand open. Owen drops the scalpel as he opens his hand. It clatters on the floor. He is sufficiently freaked. TIME CUT TO : Owen sits on the table as Martha tends to his hand.\nMARTHA : The wound's not going to heal, so, you're going to have to re-stitch it every week or so. At least you don't need anesthetic.\nOWEN : Yeah, can't feel anything. I can't feel the needle or thread. I can't feel your hands on mine. Yet, I can touch things. I can hold 'em, I know they're there. But I just... can't feel anything. I'm numb.\nMARTHA : Do you see why Jack's worried ? Bruises won't heal. Bones won't mend. You're... fragile. Owen takes a breath.\nOWEN : Yeah, well, I'd better get used to doing things myself. He takes the needle and thread from her to stitch up his own hand.\nMAGGIE (PRE-LAP, v.o.) : So she offers to help you and you push her away ? Charming.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT (PRESENT)\nMaggie takes another cigarette out of the box.\nOWEN : Yeah, hole in the chest. Sorry if I don't follow social niceties any more. Owen climbs up on the wall to take his seat next to her.\nMAGGIE : You mean you did before ? She lights the cigarette.\nOWEN : God, you're a pain in the arse, aren't you ? Is that why your man dumped you ? (She looks at him). Ooh, I hit a nerve ? What, did you get your heart broken ?\nMAGGIE : No, actually. He died.\nOWEN : I'm sorry.\nMAGGIE : No you're not. You couldn't care less about me and I don't care about you. Just because we're both planning on jumping, it doesn't mean we have some sort of special connection.\nOWEN : You don't know the half of it.\nINT. THE HUB - WORKSTATIONS / JACK'S OFFICE (EARLIER)\nGwen is at her workstation going through some papers. Owen walks up to her and puts her cup down. His hand is bandaged up. She glances at him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOwen talks with Jack.\nOWEN : Give me something to do.\nJACK : You know I can't. Rules and regulations. Owen takes Jack's cup and plate.\nOWEN : Fine. I might as well go home then.\nJACK : Okay. Owen turns toward the door. He turns back.\nOWEN : What exactly do I do when I get there ?\nJACK : Watch TV... chill.\nOWEN : Jack, I'm dead. I'm permanently chilled. You know, you get to live forever. I get to die forever. It's funny that. Owen turns and leaves.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. OWEN'S PLACE - DAY\nOwen is back at home, sitting on the sofa with the television set on.\nMAN 1 (from tv) : I'll look into it myself.\nMAN 2 (from tv) : Can I arrange something for later ?\nRANDOM MAN (from tv) : Yep.\nHOST (from tv) : Oh, hello ! And welcome to To Buy Or Not To Buy, the property show that lets you indulge in your... Owen turns the sound off. He sits on the sofa for a moment, puts the remote down and rubs his eyes. He gets up and looks at his place. He picks up a large trash bag, walks over to the refrigerator, turns the iPod on and opens the refrigerator. He clears out the food inside.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIn the bathroom, he throws away the toilet tissue. He opens the medicine cabinet and tosses all the shaving and grooming products on the bottom shelf. CUT BACK TO : Owen clears off the items on the refrigerator door. CUT BACK TO : In the bathroom, Owen tosses all the products on the top shelf in the medicine cabinet.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOwen takes the garbage bag and closes the refrigerator door. He picks up the brand new loaf of bread on the table and looks at it. He tosses it in the garbage bag. He then throws away all the food on the table. He throws away the food on the counter, including a bowl of fresh fruit... and a handful of rotting bananas. He stops.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOwen is back to sitting on the couch.\nVARIOUS CUTS OF OWEN BEING BORED\nHe stands in the bathroom. He looks at his empty refrigerator.) More Owen being bored. His eyes drift shut. Suddenly, his doorbell is ringing. It takes him a moment to realize that his doorbell is ringing. Owen opens the door and finds Toshiko there. She smiles at him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nToshiko bursts in. She's carrying a box of pizza.\nTOSHIKO : Do you mind if I eat, I'm starving ? She heads into the kitchen.\nOWEN : No, help yourself. So, Jack asked you to come round did he ? \"Talk to Owen. Get him to open up, goddamn it\". He sits at the counter.\nTOSHIKO : You haven't changed, have you ? It's all about Owen. (She grabs her bottle of drink and looks around). I've had a hell of a morning, you know. Do you have a... ? She motions opening the bottle.\nOWEN (points) : Top drawer. She turns to get the bottle opener.\nTOSHIKO : So, Jack calls me in at 5:00 this morning. (She opens the bottle). He could've waited until I got in, but no, strange energy spike, and it's \"Let's get Tosh in.\" Oh, and when Gwen got in, first thing she did ? Say sorry for not asking me to be bridesmaid. (voice fades) I mean, me, a bridesmaid ? Toshiko eats and continues talking. Owen drowns her out, not paying attention to her.\nMAGGIE (v.o.) : You sound like an old married couple.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - PRESENT\nOwen and Maggie talk.\nMAGGIE : Brian used to say I talked too much.\nOWEN : Tell me about him.\nMAGGIE : Today's my wedding anniversary.\nQuick flashes of : Maggie exiting the church in her white wedding dress. She and her husband leave.\nMAGGIE (whispers) : My perfect day...\nQuick flashes of : Maggie is walking along the road, her white dress drenched red with blood. She staggers, then sits on the side of the grassy hill.\nMAGGIE : It was an accident.\nQuick flash of : Maggie in her blood-stained wedding dress. She heads toward the overturned car. She sits on the grass and touches her dead husband's hand. She looks around for help.\nMAGGIE : We'd been married less than an hour.\nQuick flash of : Maggie climbs up the grassy hill to the road. Her face is cut. She makes her way along the empty road.\nMAGGIE : I was picking confetti out of my hair when it happens.\nOWEN : sh1t. I'm...\nMAGGIE : Sorry, yeah. I know.\nOWEN : You've waited until your wedding anniversary to kill yourself ? Why ?\nMAGGIE : Does it matter ?\nOWEN : Why have you waited ?\nMAGGIE : Because I believe people. I... I believe them when they said it would get better. So, what do you think, Doctor ? Do you... do you really think it's going to get any better ? They lapse into silence. Maggie inhales from her cigarette, then tosses it off the side of the building.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. OWEN'S PLACE - DAY (EARLIER)\nOwen is in his kitchen, staring at nothing. He closes his eyes. PAN slowly around Owen to REVEAL that Toshiko is still there and talking. We can't hear a word she's saying as Owen has tuned her out. Owen's brows furrow as something occurs to him. We hear Toshiko's voice now, mid-conversation.\nTOSHIKO (fades in) : ... bounced a message from the stars. Guess what... It's Croatian. I ran it through the language translator and it's flipping Croatian.\nOWEN (interrupts) : Why are you here, Tosh ?\nTOSHIKO : I want to help you. He nods.\nOWEN : And how are you going to do that ? How are you going to help me ? I mean, am I going to be a new special project ?\nTOSHIKO : Come on, Owen, I just...\nOWEN : That's not why you're here is it ? For some reason you want me. You know I don't know why, but you always have... always looking at me, watching me screw all those other women, your heart breaking and now it's different. Because I'm safe now, aren't I ? And it's all cozy and it's romantic and isn't it beautiful ?\nTOSHIKO : You can say what you like. I'm not leaving you.\nOWEN : Of course, not. This is it, isn't it ? This is the date that we were talking babout. You've got your beer, you've got pizza, you and me. It's just how you wanted it. All we need now is a sodding pool table.\nTOSHIKO : Stop it ! What's wrong with you ?\nOWEN : I'm broken, Tosh ! I don't work. I've got no heartbeat, no feelings, no tears ! I have got nothing to give you ! I... Do you understand that ? Maybe that's what you want ! Maybe you want somebody who's as screwed up as you ! Who's twisted and screwed up like you are. (He holds up his bandaged right hand). You want to see broken ? (He grabs his pinky finger). Do you want to see broken, Tosh ? He bends it backward till the bones crack.\nTOSHIKO : Owen ! Stop it ! What are you doing ?! He bends it all the way back. Toshiko stares at him. Owen sees the look on her face and can't take it any more. He runs out. The door slams shut behind him.\nEXT. OUTSIDE - DAY\nOwen runs... across the green grass... and past people watching. He runs as fast as he can. Owen turns and runs along the wooden pier. He runs to the end of the pier... and jumps into the water. Owen plunges into the water. He closes his eyes and all the bubbles clear. He opens his eyes and drifts in the water.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nOwen puts a hand on the wooden pier and pulls himself up. He rests there a moment. Jack steps up to him and checks his wristband.\nJACK : Thirty-six minutes. Not bad.\nOWEN : You were watching ?\nJACK : Skinny guy in tight jeans runs into water ? I was taking pictures. Jack starts walking away. Owen quickly gets up. He's dripping. Jack stops and turns around.\nJACK : How long is this going to go on for, Owen ? Jack turns and walks away from him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. THE HUB - CONFERENCE ROOM\nGwen leads the meeting with Jack, Ianto and Martha sitting at the table.\nGWEN : Ianto, what have you found out about Parker ?\nIANTO : I've identified some of the things he's purchased over the past year. We've got a Dogon eye. A pair of Myakian wings, some meteorites. An Arcateenian translation of James Herbert's The Fog. But there are a few things we've never seen before.\nGWEN : So one of these is causing the energy spikes ?\nIANTO : Looks like it. And they're getting bigger, dangerously bigger.\nGWEN : Well, okay we need to get in there. Gwen reaches across the table to hand Ianto a file. Ianto stands and leans over the table to get it.\nGWEN : Parker employs a Mr. Philip Farrington to run security. There's at least six guards, CCTV everywhere, all of which we can bring down by taking out the generator. But then there's these... (they turn to look at the monitor) heat sensors.\nMARTHA : As in body heat ?\nGWEN : Yep. Solar-powered. There's one on every doorway, every window.\nIANTO : So, how do we get past them ?\nOWEN (o.s.) : Sounds like you need a dead man. They turn and find Owen standing in the doorway, a towel draped around his neck, his hair still damp. His pinky finger is bandaged up as well.\nOWEN : Someone with no body heat. He walks into the room.\nOWEN : What have you got to lose ? He looks at Jack. Jack looks at him, measuring him. He motions to Ianto. Ianto offers Owen his gun back. Owen takes it. Jack nods. Footsteps approach. It's Toshiko. Owen turns around.\nOWEN : Tosh ? She offers his keys back to him.\nTOSHIKO : I turned your telly off. She leaves the keys with him and she walks away.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT (PRESENT)\nMaggie and Owen talk. Maggie sits on the roof wall, her back to the edge as she faces Owen.\nMAGGIE : You screamed at her, you said all those things, and that's it ?\nOWEN : That's Tosh. Always the professional. She hops off the roof wall.\nMAGGIE : I don't care. I'm not interested in you, in old men or, or alien meteors. I came here because my husband died. I just want to jump. Owen looks at her and nods. Suddenly, he grabs her and rushes toward the edge of the roof.\nOWEN : Let's get on with it !\nMAGGIE (shouts) : Get off me ! He lets her go.\nOWEN : You, you're too scared.\nMAGGIE : Aren't you ? (Owen doesn't answer her). How did... how did you get from that to here ? The sirens wail below. She looks at him.\nMAGGIE : What happened ?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. OUTSIDE PARKER RESIDENCE - NIGHT (EARLIER)\nMartha talks with Owen. Jack watches behind her with the monitors they've set up. Owen is wearing a jacket with the hood over his head.\nMARTHA : If you hurt yourself, you will not recover. Like I said... any bruises you get, they're not going to heal. Do not engage in physical combat... one punch you're gone. Be careful.\nOWEN : I understand, I'm made of glass. Owen turns to head out.\nMARTHA : Owen ? He stops and looks at her.\nMARTHA : Just take care. He nods, then turns to head out when Jack stops him.\nJACK : Oh, and... uh ... you'll need this. Jack tosses a white cloth to him. Owen looks at Jack. Owen nods, then turns to go. He runs down the path along the bushes.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTOP VIEW DOWN on the estate pool. A security guard walks along the edge of the pool. PULL BACK to show the large wall bordering the estate and Owen making his way on the outside of the wall. Owen stops outside the gate and looks in. He presses his back to the stone wall.\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : Owen ? Owen turns his comm on.\nOWEN (quietly to comm) : Yeah... Hi, Tosh.\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : Okay, the power in the house is supplied from one private electrical generator. There's a backup unit but take the main one down and you've got one minute, twenty of blackout time. The security guard walks past the gate.\nOWEN : Can you get rid of one of the blokes here ?\nIANTO : It might look a bit suspicious if there were two phone calls.\nOWEN : Try and make it the big one, okay ? The two guards circle around the pool in a routine manner. Something shrieks in the night. One of the guards turns and looks. A cell phone rings. The guard turns and looks at the other guard. Owen also turns and quickly glances at the guard nearest the gate whose phone is ringing. The smaller guard answers his phone.\nOWEN (quiet) : Arse. BEN TAYLOR (GUARD) (to phone) : Hello ? INTERCUT WITH :\nINT. THE HUB - WORKSTATIONS\nGwen is on the speakerphone.\nGWEN (to phone) : Mr. Taylor ?\nBEN TAYLOR (to phone) : Yeah, that's right. Who's this ?\nGWEN (to phone) : I'm calling from St. Helen's Hospital. Mrs. Christine Taylor was brought in an hour ago. She's been involved in a car accident. The other guard approaches Ben Taylor.\nBEN TAYLOR (to phone) : Is she hurt ?\nGWEN : She's going to be fine, but she's asking to see you.\nBEN TAYLOR : Of course, I'm on my way. He hangs up.\nGUARD 2 : You all right ?\nBEN TAYLOR : It's Chrissie, she's been in an accident. Look, I've got to go.\nGUARD 2 : Yeah, of course. Ben leaves. Owen quickly moves to the other side of the gate. The remaining guard looksaround.\nGUARD 2 (to radio) : Mr. Farrington ? Ben's had to go. His wife's been in an accident. The guard walks out of the pool area through the gate. He passes Owen without seeing him. Owen runs in through the gate, passes the pool and quickly up the lawn. Owen makes his way cautiously along the wall of the greenhouse building. He reaches the main lawn and stops for a moment, then continues toward the electrical box.\nOWEN (quietly, to comm) : Okay, guys, I'm here. He opens the electrical box. The hinges squeak. A guard walks up to him from behind.\nGUARD : Move away from there. Startled, Owen turns around to find the guard walking up to him.\nGUARD (grabs Owen) : I said ! Owen kicks the guard. The guard falls to the ground. Owen takes out the white cloth Jack gave him. He looks at it and sees it's a t-shirt complete with toon boy and dog : Tintin.\nOWEN (groans) : Yeah, okay, guys. Very funny. Owen wraps the shirt around his hand just as the guard starts to get up.\nGUARD : Argh ! Owen pulls his gun out and the guard stops.\nOWEN : No, no, no. Do you want to see what I can do ?\nGUARD : What ? Owen turns and sticks his shirt-wrapped hand in the electrical box and shorts it out. The lights in the house flash. Owen grins.\nOWEN : Woo ! Owen pulls out the main cable. The power goes out completely.\nOWEN : I'm dead already, mate.\nFARRINGTON (over radio) : Webb ? Dave, are you there ? Before he can answer, Owen kicks him and knocks him out.\nGUARD : Oh !\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : One minute, twenty until the backup generator comes online. Owen turns and runs toward the main house.\nFARRINGTON (from radio) : This is Farrington to all units. The backup generator will be running in 45 seconds. Stay at your posts, please.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - FRONT DOORS / FOYER - NIGHT\nOwen reaches the front doors and kneels in front of the glass.\nFARRINGTON (from radio) : Mr. Parker's personal generator is unaffected.\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : Sorry, Owen, they've obviously had some work done. He pushes the front doors open and steps cautiously into the house. As he walks in, he notices the green sensor lights on the floor.\nOWEN : Heat sensors. He waves his arm direction in its path. Nothing. He looks at his hand.\nOWEN : I am literally too cool for school. He turns his flashlight on and looks around. He makes his way into the house.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nOwen makes his way through the hallway.\nOWEN : Right, I'm in.\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : Okay, the energy reading seems to be coming from the first floor. A room at the back of the house.\nOWEN : Can you give me anything else ?\nTOSHIKO (from comm) : No, the energy source is playing havoc with the system, sorry.\nOWEN : No worries. I'm getting used to being in the dark. Owen reaches a room that looks like the kitchen. The power switches on and the lights power up. Owen runs.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS\nOwen starts up the stairs. A security guard appears at the top of the steps behind Owen.\nSECURITY GUARD : Hold it there. Owen stops. He pushes his hood back and looks at the security guard at the top of the stairs, measuring him.\nOWEN : Evenin'. Nice place you've got here. (Starts up slowly). Love what you've done with the pictures.\nSECURITY GUARD : Who are you ? Why aren't the sensors picking you up ? There are sensors at each corner of the window Owen is walking past. The guard starts getting nervous. Owen continues up the stairs.\nSECURITY GUARD : Okay, stop ! Stop or I'll shoot.\nOWEN : No, you won't. You're a security guard. Come on, that gun's just for show, innit ? Owen continues up the stairs.\nOWEN : Do you know what a bullet does to a living person ? It's not like a knife through butter, no, no, no, no. It rotates, tears into the flesh and the gooey stuff behind... it rips into the organs, and, ooh, it's not nice. Owen is nearly to the top of the stairs.\nOWEN : But anyway, I haven't got any body heat. You must know what that means ? You can't kill a dead man.\nSECURITY GUARD : What are you ?\nOWEN : I'm wrong.\nSECURITY GUARD : What are you ?! Owen shows him his broken left hand.\nOWEN : I'm broken. I'm Dr Owen Harper. Owen grabs the gun away from the security guard.\nOWEN : And I'm having one hell of a day. Owen smashes the gun into the security guard's face, knocking him out. Owen steps over the guard, drops the security guard's gun near him and takes his own gun out. The cartridge clicks as he snaps it in place.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nOwen starts down the hallway, his gun held out in front of him.\nEXT. OUTSIDE PROPERTY\nJack and Martha wait.\nINT. THE HUB - NIGHT\nIanto and Gwen wait.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nOwen continues through the hallway. He checks the first door, then continues. Owen reaches the end of the hallway. He opens the door and enters the room. In the room is a shelf with various items on display. Owen looks at the items. Whatever he's looking for isn't there. He turns and looks at a second shelf with more items on display. Again, not there. Owen lifts his gun and heads for the door at the back of the room.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - PARKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\nOwen opens the door and finds Parker's bedroom, a large mosquito net-covered bed in the middle of the room with various medical equipment and monitors around it. Owen walks in. Henry Parker is on the bed, seemingly asleep. Owen turns to look at some items on display on a shelf.\nHENRY PARKER : Yes ? Owen is startled. He turns and finds Henry Parker awake. A heart monitor beeps steadily.\nOWEN : It's okay, mate. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm a doctor.\nHENRY PARKER : You're a very violent doctor. I've been watching you. Parker lifts his hand and indicates the security monitors set up nearby. Owen pushes the netting aside to look at the old man.\nOWEN : Henry Parker, yeah ?\nHENRY PARKER : You're Torchwood, yes ? INTERCUT WITH : Outside, Jack and Martha listen. HENRY PARKER (from Owen's comm) : Did the American send you ? Martha turns and looks at Jack. Jack looks at Martha.\nOWEN : Yeah, he sent me. How do you know so much about us ?\nHENRY PARKER : They could've sent that Japanese girl, I like her. INTERCUT WITH : In the hub, Toshiko listens and is surprised.\nOWEN : Yeah, well, I'm sorry. You got me.\nHENRY PARKER : Is she... uh... on your phone thing ? That earpiece ?\nOWEN : Yeah.\nHENRY PARKER (to Toshiko) : Hello ! Just to say you've got very lovely legs. (Toshiko smiles). You should show them off more. Parker coughs.\nOWEN : What's wrong with you ?\nHENRY PARKER : Three heart attacks and a failed bypass. But I'm fine, because I have this. Parker takes out the alien device hidden under his covers. It looks like a large shell. It glows, pulses with light and emits a hollow sound.\nHENRY PARKER : It's called \"the Pulse\".\nOWEN : You know what it is ? Owen takes his backpack off and opens it.\nHENRY PARKER : I named it. It's keeping me alive. (Owen takes his hand-held device out to measure the energy readings). No ! You're not taking it. Owen takes his readings.\nOWEN : It could be dangerous. We've been detecting massive energy readings.\nHENRY PARKER : I don't care. All I know is, it works.\nOWEN : Well, I'm sorry, it doesn't.\nHENRY PARKER : What ?\nOWEN : The energy isn't going into you. The power's just building up inside that thing, that's what we've been detecting but... it isn't actually doing anything for you.\nHENRY PARKER : You're wrong. I can feel it. No, no. I'm not going to die.\nOWEN : Listen, please. Listen to me. There are loads of people's lives at risk. If that explodes, then we don't know what the fallout will be.\nHENRY PARKER : You're young. You don't understand what dying feels like.\nOWEN : Believe me, I do. I really do.\nHENRY PARKER : There's nothing there !\nOWEN : Where ?\nHENRY PARKER : On the other side, nothing. I'm dying. Take away my Pulse and I'm gone, my body decomposing.\nOWEN : You can't stop it, Mr. Parker. I'm sorry, but it's going to happen one day. Owen pulls up a chair and sits down next to the bed.\nHENRY PARKER : It'll be dark and I'll be alone.\nOWEN : Where are you now ? It's dark and you're all alone, so what's the difference ?\nHENRY PARKER : I don't understand what's keeping me here. Parker coughs. The monitor alarm beeps. Owen puts the oxygen mask on Parker and lets him breathe in deep. After he's calmed down and the monitor alarm stops, Owen removes the oxygen mask.\nOWEN : It's hope. That thing... it's just hope. Do you really think all this is better than death ?\nHENRY PARKER : It's got to be. It is better !\nOWEN : You're just scared of the darkness. Join the club. Trust me. I know how sh1t everything can be.\nHENRY PARKER : Eh... Don't you sit there pontificating, you're just a boy. What do you know about anything ? I've traveled the world. I fought in the war. Started my own business. I made a fortune. Married. Widowed. My collection, all of it. I've done so much and this is where I ended up. Alone. Lying in my own piss and do you know what I want ?\nOWEN : Clean sheets ?\nHENRY PARKER : I want a steak. Medium rare. Black pepper sauce. Look at me ! Fed through a tube. I might as well be dead already. (The Pulse keens. Softly). I might as well be dead. Why don't you take it ? Parker lifts the Pulse and offers it to Owen.\nHENRY PARKER (softly) : Take it. Owen takes it from him and sets it aside on the bed.\nOWEN : Well ?\nHENRY PARKER : Oh, Christ, it's dark, I'm alone, I'm so alone. Owen reaches for his hand and holds it.\nOWEN : It's all right, I'm here with you.\nHENRY PARKER : Uh. I'm still stuck here, though. In this bed, in the dark.\nOWEN : You know what ? I'm going to come back. You and me. We're going to face all of this together. I'm going to help you.\nHENRY PARKER : Torchwood, if you come back, you can tell me all about it. Tell me what it's like. I want to hear about the aliens and everything ! I need... I need to know that there's more out there. That this isn't all there is. (Off Owen's hesitant look). Oh, come on ! I'm dying, who am I going to tell, the Angel Gabriel ? If you come back, I won't tell the Japanese girl that you're still holding my hand.\nOWEN : Well, maybe. Parker smiles. He starts coughing and the heart monitor flatlines. Owen turns and reaches for the oxygen mask. He puts it on Parker's face.\nOWEN : Deep breath. Owen turns and presses the buttons on the machine.\nOWEN : Mr. Parker ? The heart monitor flatlines. Parker doesn't respond. Owen sets the oxygen mask aside.\nOWEN : Henry ? Still no response. Owen gets to work. He turns and checks the monitors. He checks Parker for a pulse and removes the pillow from behind his head. He starts chest compressions and leans in to give him mouth-to-mouth when he stops. He has no breath to give him. He lifts his hand to his mouth. No breath. Owen hits the bed in frustration.\nOWEN : I'm sorry. I'm so sorry ! Owen puts his head down in frustration and despair.\nOWEN (PRE-LAP, v.o.) : I couldn't save him.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - PRESENT\nOWEN : He needed to give him air but I couldn't. I've got no breath ! Everything I've seen, everything that's out there and it was an old man dying of a heart attack. It was just another person dying because of me. (Owen climbs up on the wall and stands up). Everything that's happened and that was the final straw. Because at that moment I just wanted it all to end.\nTOSHIKO (PRE-LAP, from comm.) : Owen.\nOwen closes his eyes.\nINT. MAIN HOUSE - PARKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\nOwen's head is down on Parker's chest. The Pulse is glowing dangerously bright next to him.\nTOSHIKO (from comm.) : Owen, can you hear me ? Owen doesn't respond. INTERCUT WITH :\nINT. THE HUB\nTOSHIKO (firmly) : Owen, come in !\nOwen stirs.\nOWEN (mumbles) : Yeah, yeah, I'm here.\nTOSHIKO : The device ? Is it doing anything ? (Owen glances at the Pulse). Because the energy levels coming from it are... Owen ? It's going off the screen. INTERCUT WITH : The bright light on Toshiko's monitor grows brighter and brighter with waves of energy emitting from the source.\nTOSHIKO : It's going to explode ! INTERCUT WITH :\nJACK : Tosh ? What can we do ?\nTOSHIKO : Nothing ! There's nothing ! Gwen and Ianto head toward Toshiko. Owen reaches for the Pulse. He's strangely calm about it.\nOWEN : It's okay. I'm going to hold it.\nJACK : Owen, what are you doing ?\nOWEN (from comm) : See if I can absorb it.\nTOSHIKO : Owen, the energy reading's off the scale. You won't survive. Owen tucks the Pulse in the crook of his arm and cradles it close to his body.\nOWEN : It's okay. These things happen.\nMARTHA : There must be something we can do.\nOWEN (from comm) : Martha, Martha.\nMARTHA : Owen ?\nOWEN : If it destroys me, they're going to need a new doctor. You've got all the credentials : medical skills, a cracking arse. Toshiko, Gwen and Ianto listen. Everyone is quiet. He means it.\nOWEN : Jack ? If you even attempt to bring me back again. Gwen, Ianto, it was fun. Honestly, thank you. Tosh ? (Silence) Tosh ? Come on, answer me.\nTOSHIKO : Owen.\nOWEN : I'm sorry. Beat.\nTOSHIKO : I love you. Waves of colored light float out of the Pulse as it grows and ribbons out... reaching. Owen closes his eyes and holds onto the Pulse. The light continues to grow and reach out past Owen.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - PRESENT\nOwen and Maggie are up on the roof.\nMAGGIE : What happened ?\nOWEN : We all assume life's going to be sh1t, don't we ? That it's all just darkness. But you know what ? Sometimes, it's not. Owen gets off the wall. He kneels and opens his backpack on the ground. He takes out the Pulse. Bursts of ribbons of light continue to fluctuate out from the device. He turns and shows it to Maggie. She kneels to look at it, enraptured by it.\nMAGGIE : What is it ?\nOWEN : Do you remember in the '70s, NASA sent messages into space ? A map of our solar system, pictures of what we look like. It had images and voices, music. Even a bit of Chuck Berry. Well, this is a reply, not that we know who from.\nMAGGIE : What does it do ?\nOWEN : It sang to me. He holds it up to her. A ribbon of light reaches out from the device. It floats and waves back and forth between them.\nOWEN : It's a glimmer of light in the darkness. See ? Sometimes it does get better. They take a moment and watch the light.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. CARDIFF CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT\nEXT. THE PLAZA - NIGHT\nJack, Owen and Martha get out of the SUV. Gwen and Ianto join them. Owen turns and helps Martha out of the back seat.\nOWEN : Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Jones. No vacancies in Cardiff just yet.\nMARTHA : That's okay. I reckon you're... I was going to say \"fine\", but you're a hell of a lot more than that.\nOWEN : Thank you. For everything. Owen kisses Martha on the cheek. He gives her a hug.\nJACK (interrupts) : Oi ! Jack smiles.\nMARTHA : That's what I'm here for. Martha goes over to Gwen, who gives her a hug.\nGWEN : You take care.\nMARTHA : Okay. Martha gives Ianto a kiss on the cheek. She turns to Jack.\nMARTHA : Well, it's been... interesting.\nJACK : Oh, it's been fun. (Soft) You know it has. Martha surprises Jack and kisses him. She steps back and he looks at her curiously.\nMARTHA (chuckles) : Well, everyone else has had a go. He cups her cheek and looks at her seriously.\nJACK : You can so come back anytime.\nMARTHA : Well, maybe I will. One day. She taps her fingers to her forehead in a salute. Jack salutes her. Martha walks away with her bag and case.\nINT. THE HUB - NIGHT\nToshiko and Owen sit on the couch and talk.\nTOSHIKO : Promise me something.\nOWEN : What's that ?\nTOSHIKO : No more locking it all away. You tell me when it's bad. Share it with me. Okay ?\nOWEN (nods) : Okay. Tosh, I'm scared. I'm scared that if I close my eyes I'll get trapped, in the darkness. She holds onto his arm.\nTOSHIKO : I'm here. Owen thinks about it for a moment, then puts his hand on hers. She puts her other hand on his.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT\nOwen is walking along the sidewalk. As he walks, something flutters to the ground right in front of him. He picks it up and finds that it's a folded photo of a man and woman. He thinks about it for a moment. Where could it have come from? He looks up and sees a young woman on the edge of the rooftop.\nOWEN (v.o.) : And that's when I saw you.\nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - PRESENT\nMAGGIE : I thought you came here to jump ?\nOWEN : No, I came here to help.\nHe returns her folded photo back to her. She takes it and opens it.\nMAGGIE : What do I do now ?\nOWEN : You've got a choice. If you think that the darkness is too much, then go for it. But if there is a chance, just some hope. It could be having a cigarette, or that first sip of hot tea on a cold morning, or it could be your mates, if there's even a tiny glimmer of light then don't you think that's worth taking a chance ? Maggie's quiet.\nOWEN : What's your name ?\nMAGGIE : Maggie. Maggie Hopley. With his free hand, Owen holds Maggie's hand. In his other hand, he's holding the Pulse which has now blossomed with even more ribbons of light.\nOWEN : Well, Maggie, it's up to you. Your choice. (Owen looks at the Pulse). Do you still want to jump ? They stand there together.\nOWEN (v.o.) : My name is Owen Harper and this is my life. The ribbons of light reach out and grow from the Pulse. It zooms out, twists, curls and reaches out toward the city.", "source": "tv_show_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"instructions": ["Write a summary for the scene."], "outputs": ["When Kenny decides that each show on KACL requires a special theme jingle , Frasier struggles to think of one. Martin composes a catchy tune, but Frasier dismisses it, instead composing an overblown theme which combines a Broadway musical -style chorus with an incongruous film-score background for Niles' monologue), before being forced to provide something short and simple, which Martin again composes."], "input": "ACT I\nScene 1 - KACL Frasier is finishing a segment.\nFrasier: And we'll be right back after this short news break. Gil enters.\nGil: Frasier...I'm here to give you an advance tip.\nFrasier: Really?\nRoz enters from the booth.\nRoz: Hey, Gil.\nGil: Roz! I'm about to review a divine new Italian trattoria I've discovered called \"Bella, Bella.\"\nFrasier: Ah-ha.\nGil: I'm alerting you now because once I review it, reservations will be impossible to come by.\nFrasier: Well, thank you, Gil, it's always gratifying to be a few minutes ahead of a trend.\nGil: They make an osso bucco that's so divine I call it the \"Veal Shank Redemption.\"\nThey give Gil a courtesy laugh. Kenny enters.\nKenny: Hey, guys.\nFrasier: Hello, Kenny.\nKenny: Show's going great, Frasier, uh, only one thing missing, of course...\nFrasier: I know, I know, a new theme song. I'm sorry, I just haven't gotten around to it yet.\nKenny: Well, Mrs. Delafield's been hounding me on this. She really thinks each show having a theme song will help hook the listeners. Gil's got his.\nGil: My first choice was \"Food, Glorious Food\" from the show Oliver!\nFrasier: Ooh, that's a perfect match. Haute cuisine and a chorus of starving orphans.\nGil: But then, a composer friend of mine came up with this little ditty for me [He sings:] Whether choosing a wine Or the best place to dine-- It's all a matter of taste (Yes, sir!) It's all a matter of taste!\nKenny: Great, huh?\nFrasier politely nods. The tune is as lame as the lyrics.\nGil: And the nicest thing is, he didn't take a penny for it!\nFrasier: Well, at least he has a conscience.\nHe chuckles. Gil leaves, somewhat miffed.\nFrasier: You know, Kenny, I'm sorry for procrastinating this thing. I-I tell you, I'll get one as soon as I possibly can.\nKenny: Well, you better come up with something here. I'm sorry to be a hard-ass. It's the part of my job I hate the most, but I need this thing on my desk by Monday...ish.\nKenny smiles and leaves.\nFrasier: You know, Roz - hearing Gil's little ditty puts me in mind that maybe we should just do - ah, an original song.\nRoz: Well, my new boyfriend Leon is in a band. He could write one for you.\nFrasier: Well, actually, I was thinking of composing it myself. I am not without musical ability, you know.\nRoz: Could you at least hire Leon to accompany you?\nFrasier: I take it he's desperate for work?\nRoz: Hasn't had a gig in months. Music is all he knows. He's not good at anything else - except in bed. It's what he does best.\nFrasier: Yeah. How long did it take you to find that out?\nRoz: [about the show] Ten seconds, Frasier.\nFrasier: Oh, longer than usual.\nShe returns to her booth and he replaces his headphones.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene 2 - Frasier's apartment He opens the door to Niles.\nNiles: Frasier.\nFrasier: Oh, Niles. Oh, dear. We had dinner plans tonight, didn't we?\nNiles: Yes. Don't tell me you're canceling.\nFrasier: Well, I have to. I have a little project this evening.\nNiles: Oh. Would this have anything to do with this new theme song you promised your listeners?\nFrasier: As a matter of fact, it does. I've got to have something by Monday, and I thought I'd take advantage of a nice quiet evening at home.\nThe loud sound of a vacuum is heard.\nFrasier: Oh. Daphne - Daphne! Would you please turn off that vacuum cleaner?\nDaphne enters with a fancy steam cleaner.\nDaphne: It's not a vacuum cleaner. It's the \"Dirt Scourge 2000.\" A total cleansing system.\nMartin: [from his chair] Is it new?\nDaphne: Yeah. I got it this afternoon. You see, this water traps all of the dirt particles instead of recycling them back into the air. I got all that [indicating] from Dr. Crane's pillow.\nNiles examines the dirt.\nMartin: Ew.\nNiles: I've been begging you to switch to a more abrasive loofah.\nDaphne: Well, it would be the same for anyone. Dead skin, dust mites... that's what we're all sleeping on, only we don't know it.\nMartin: We do now. Geez.\nMartin rises and exits toward the kitchen.\nDaphne: This is the chance I've been waiting for.\nShe turns on the machine and begins to apply it to Martin's chair. The machine begins to audibly struggle, and the water in the tank immediately turns black and brackish. Niles and Frasier watch with concern. She has barely started when it suddenly shorts out, sparks flying in an electrical explosion. When the smoke clears, Daphne walks back to the main part of the cleaner.\nFrasier: Well. Apparently the \"Dirt Scourge 2000\" is no match for the \"Dirt Pile 1957.\"\nDaphne: Well, this is going back. On the commercial they clean all the mud off a hippopotamus.\n[She exits.]\nFrasier: Well, at least now I can get down to work. You know, Niles, I'm sorry again about dinner, but can I buy you a sherry?\nNiles: Oh... thank you. About this theme song of yours... why don't you just use a standard?\nFrasier: Actually, I want to compose one myself. I've always had an affinity for music, and I've often wondered what I might achieve if I just rolled up my sleeves and gave it a try.\nMartin: [re-entering] Didn't you write some kind of musical back in prep school?\nFrasier: Yes, I did, Dad. Niles was in it. You know, the whole school came out humming my opening anthem.\nNiles: They went in humming it. It was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony note for note.\nFrasier: [over Niles] It was not.\nNiles: It absolutely was.\nFrasier: It was not at all.\nNiles: [singing to the tune of the \"Ode to Joy\" theme from the finale of Beethoven's Ninth:] We are valiant men of honor Wenching, brawling sons of...\nFrasier: All right, all right, well, I suppose I may have borrowed a Note or two as a launching pad.\nNiles: [moving to the third, contrasting phrase of the Beethoven theme] Prancing, leaping, laughing...\nFrasier: All right, point taken.\nNiles: Over hill and...\nFrasier: Stop it!\nNiles: I'm just teasing. Actually, it was a wonderful show. I was very proud to be acting in it.\nFrasier: You know, Niles, you were wonderful in it as well.\nNiles: Well, thank you, I thought so.\nFrasier: Mm-hmm.\nNiles: I often thought if I'd kept at it, I could have been a professional actor.\nFrasier: Ah, you see, we all have a road not taken, some unfinished business worth exploring.\nMartin: Yeah, I always wanted to be a toe dancer, but a bullet ended my dream.\nFrasier and Niles shake off the sarcasm.\nNiles: Well, Frasier, if you need any help with this, I'm right here.\nFrasier: Thank you, Niles. You know, I'd rather handle the composing chores myself, but I could use a sounding board.\nNiles: Fair enough, let's put our heads together.\nFrasier: All right.\nNiles: Figuratively speaking, of course. I saw what came out of your pillow.\nThey head back toward the piano.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nA BRIDGE TOO FAR\nScene 3 - Later that night Niles plunks out some notes on the piano. Frasier is standing.\nNiles: You know, I think this new bridge is the best thing you've written.\nFrasier: Really?\nNiles: Oh, absolutely.\nHe sings to a jaunty tune, beginning with the notes he had plunked and accompanying himself:\nNiles: Claustrophobia Nymphomania He will probe ya He'll explain t'ya It's brilliant.\nFrasier: You know, it does have a Cole Porter-y, Stephen Sondheim-y flavor, doesn't it?\nNiles: Oh, absolutely. Sondheim-y would have killed to have written this.\nFrasier: You know what? I'm a little nervous. It just may be a bit too conventional. Perhaps instead of a regular bridge, I could substitute it with a dramatic monologue spoken against a musical background.\nNiles: [after a beat] I like it.\nFrasier: Of course, I would have to hire an actor.\nNiles: Yes, I suppose you could squander a lot of money on some so- Called professional... someone who doesn't know a thing about psychiatry. [reaching] Who doesn't understand the whole Gestalt.\nFrasier: Or maybe you could do it.\nNiles: I think so.\nFrasier laughs and taps him on the shoulder.\nFrasier: I will write you a speech that will challenge your entire histrionic range! This is so exciting! Let's play the chorus again.\nMartin enters from his bedroom.\nMartin: Hey, hey, Fras! I just got an idea for your little jingle. It came to me while I was brushing my teeth. [He sings:] What's new? I'm listenin' Feelin' blue? I'm listenin'... Cause, you know, that's what you say on your show. Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' glad, feelin' bad I'm listenin'!\nDaphne: [who has been seated at the dining table] Bravo! That's wonderful.\nMartin: Thanks, you know, it's catchy. That's what counts in a jingle.\n[N.B. Of interest: John Mahoney appeared on the Cheers episode \"Do Not Forsake Me, O My Postman\" as Sy Flembeck, a hapless jingle composer.]\nFrasier: [politely] Uh-huh, well, that's very, very nice, Dad, it's just that, well, you know, I did promise my listeners that I'd compose this myself. It's no fair cheating.\nMartin: Oh, well, it's not cheating, technically...\nFrasier: [cutting him off] Very good, Dad, very good, but thank you, and off you go.\nMartin: Okay, all right.\nHe exits.\nNiles: Hey, um, Frasier, are you sure you want to modulate here? That may just complicate things.\nFrasier: Perhaps. You know, I'm just trying to make it interesting. To my ear, there's still something lacking, some tiny ingredient that's missing. I'm not sure what.\nScene 4 - DISSOLVE to a rehearsal hall, where a full orchestra is tuning their instruments. Frasier stands on the conductor's podium.\nFrasier: [tapping his baton] All right, everyone. Let's try this again. We still have a few minutes before the choir gets here.\nHe raises his baton and prepares to cue the opening.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEND OF ACT I\nACT II\nScene 5 - The rehearsal hall The choir has arrived.\nFrasier: Well, finally, the choir has deigned to join us.\nDirector: Sorry, our bus broke down. We had to walk two miles to get here.\nFrasier: Ah, then I suppose we can dispense with the breathing exercises I was going to recommend. Please, if you would. [indicating the choir's risers behind the orchestra] Off you go.\nNiles, who has been sitting in front of the orchestra, rises.\nNiles: Uh, Frasier... did you mean to cut paragraph five of my monologue?\nFrasier: Gosh, I might have, Niles. I've just been so busy. What was the gist?\nNiles: A lighthearted lampoon of mental health care abuse.\nFrasier: Ah, yes, I did. I was afraid that some fussbudget might take offense at my jape about lobotomies.\nNiles: Well, I suppose it's best to play it safe, although I did Like the way you indicated manic depression with a slide whistle.\nFrasier laughs. Niles looks back at the orchestra.\nNiles: Do we really have to use so many musicians?\nFrasier: For the sound I want, yes.\nNiles: Whatever happened to the concept of \"less is more\"?\nFrasier: Ah, but if less is more, just think of how much more \"more\" will be.\nNiles stares at him quizically.\nFrasier: You may be seated. Niles takes his seat.\nFrasier: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention, please, I'd like to take a few minutes to explain my artistic vision.\nTimpanist: Take as long as you want, we're all on the clock.\nFrasier: Point well taken, moving right along...\nRoz enters quickly with her boyfriend Leon.\nRoz: Frasier...I'm sorry we're late. We got stuck in traffic. Some stupid bus broke down. This is Leon.\nLeon looks like a starving folk-type musician, with long hair and a scruffy beard.\nFrasier: Ah, hello, Leon.\nLeon: Hey, Dr. Crane.\nFrasier: [shaking his hand] Lovely to meet you. Listen, why don't you help yourself to the refreshment table there. I need to have a few words with Roz.\nLeon moves away.\nFrasier: Roz, we've got a problem! In scoring this, I had to eliminate the guitar part.\nRoz: Well, put it back.\nFrasier: Well, I can't. I'm afraid another instrument might make Things sound cluttered... unless, of course, Leon can play the bagpipe.\nRoz: The bagpipe?\nFrasier: Yes! Our show deals with a whole range of human emotion from euphoria to despair, and nothing says despair so quickly as the skirl of a bagpipe.\nRoz: Nothing says \"Turn off the radio\" so quickly either. Isn't there something else he can play?\nFrasier: Well, uh... yes, yes! Actually, our triangle player called in with a touch of tinnitus. Here we are.\nLeon returns.\nFrasier: Leon, I have some good news for you. I had to eliminate the Guitar part, but I'm promoting you to first triangle.\nHe hands him the triangle and its beater.\nLeon: Uh, I've never played one of these. It looks tricky. Frasier stares agape at Roz.\nRoz: I'll work with him.\nFrasier: Yes, off you go.\nThey move to the percussion section.\nFrasier: Well, then, now people, before we start, are there any questions?\nThe principal violist raises her hand.\nFrasier: Yes, viola.\nTiffany: My name is Tiffany.\nFrasier: No, no no. I'm calling you by your instrument name, so as to avoid confusion.\nTiffany: Oh, well I have a question about measure 34...\nFrasier: Ah... I thought you might. Yes, you see, I've accelerated the tempo there in order to depict the yearning of the superego. Very perceptive of you to spot that.\nTiffany: No, I meant, are these eighth notes or what?\nFrasier: [miffed] Yes... eighth notes. Anyone else?\nThe timpanist raises his hand.\nFrasier: Yes, timpani?\nTiffany: You just answered my question.\nFrasier: Not Tiffany, timpani.\nTimpanist: What are we rehearsing this for? Are we going to record it?\nFrasier: Yes, actually, we are waiting for the final go-ahead from my station manager, and then we will be recording it, yes. Anyone else?\nNiles raises his hand.\nFrasier: Yes... actor.\nNiles: I'm just wondering how my monologue is going to be audible over all these instruments.\nFrasier: Oh, that's a good point, Niles. [beat] You may be seated. [after Niles sits] It is imperative that everyone play [pianissimo] during the spoken portions - very, very softly. That applies particularly to brass and timpani.\nTiffany: Why me?\nFrasier: [incredulous at her dimness] To the drums, Tiffany.\nMartin and Daphne enter.\nFrasier: Oh, Dad, Daphne, I'm so glad you came! He embraces them.\nDaphne: Oh, well, after all, it is the world premiere of your theme song.\nFrasier: Now, I don't have to search you two for any hidden recording devices, do I? The last thing I need is some bootleg CD's flooding the marketplace.\nMartin: Boy, you really got everything here!\nFrasier: Oh, it's not a time for stinting, Dad. I've got everything from the African rain stick to the Javanese tam-tam.\nMartin: [at the refreshment table] Are the tam-tams the long ones with the cream in the middle?\nKenny enters.\nFrasier: Oh, Kenny, Kenny! I'm so glad you made it. Listen, I think you're in for a bit of a surprise.\nKenny: Well, I gotta tell you, I don't surprise easily. [seeing the orchestra] Whoa!\nFrasier: Our little ensemble. Heh-heh.\nKenny: So many musicians... all working on a weekend.\nKenny checks his watch.\nFrasier: Now, listen, I realize that we are a bit over budget, and I promise, I will pick up the difference myself.\nKenny sits.\nFrasier: All right. The time has come to unveil my magnum opus. Just Let me do a little fine-tuning on the opening fanfare.\nHe moves to the podium.\nFrasier: Uh, brass, if you will please, in four, the first measure?\nFrasier beats out a preparatory measure in 4/4. The trumpets play a very conventional fanfare flawlessly.\nFrasier: Well, you see, that's fine as far as it goes, but this time I want you to do it with a bit more... grandeur. With some majesty and a soupcon of awe.\nThe trumpets play the fanfare exactly as before. Frasier turns to Kenny, Martin, Daphne, and Roz, who are seated behind him.\nFrasier: There, you see. That's what good conducting can do. Kenny gets a puzzled, concerned, incredulous look on his face.\nFrasier: All right, everyone. The time we have been waiting for is at hand. And with a simple bow of thanks to the muse Calliope, let us begin. And...\nThe four audience members exchange a look of incredulity, not knowing what to expect. The maestro raises his baton, and we hear his magnum opus.\nHe conducts a preparatory measure again, and the trumpets play the fanfare. This is followed by the strings, who settle into a conventional broadway-style vamp that doesn't seem to \"fit\" the preceding fanfare. After a harp glissando, the first chorus is then presented by three soloists and the choir.\nCHORUS 1\nSoloist 1: (tenor) Who can you turn to for prompt diagnosis?\nSoloist 2: (soprano) A fetish or fantasy\nSoloist 3: (bass) s*x or psychosis\nSoloist 1: No problem at all, let us handle your call\nChoir: (unison) On our show! On our show!\nProminent drum beats accompany \"On our show!\" Martin exchanges a glance with Daphne and Roz.\nCHORUS 2\nSoloist 2: Bring us your traumas, your latent neurosis\nSoloist 1: Erectile disfunction (the \"r\" prominently rolled)\nSoloist 3: Bed-wetting narcosis\nSoloist 1: There's no need for shame, you can use a false name\nChoir: (unison) On our show! On our show!\nFrasier is delighted with the performance thus far. The orchestra now settles down to a suspenseful and quietly sustained chord. The musical material of the choruses is very clich\u00e9d Broadway/Disney-style fare, so the suspenseful film-score background chords and the overly dramatic delivery of Niles's following monologue is extremely incongruous:\nNiles: [rising] Who dares enter the dark labyrinth of the human mind?\nA percussion player draws a string bow across a metal object, producing an unpleasant whining sound. The orchestra changes harmonies to a higher chord. Frasier marks time with dramatic baton gestures as he prepares to cue the harmonic changes.\nNiles: What festering secrets are buried in the recesses of the subconscious?\nAnother percussionist drags something across a gong, producing another unpleasant sound.\nNiles: Lurid images!\nAnother harmonic shift upward comes with Niles's words, which are followed by the shaking of a circus-style rattle/whistle.\nNiles: Lewd desires!\nYet another chord shift with Niles's line, followed by a slide whistle, which presumably illustrates the \"lewd desires.\"\nNiles: Guilty pleasures!\nA chord shift with Niles again, and a \"grunting\" sound from the orchestra.\nNiles: Strange compulsions!\nOne more harmonic shift with Niles, followed by a dissonant trombone splat. Niles, startled, stares at the trombone player. The strings then play a quick rising transitional passage, leading to a suspenseful high note.\nNiles: The whole catalogue of human behavior from the aberrant to the monstrous lurks behind a locked door to which one man holds the key!\nA huge beat of the gong (tam-tam), which startles the others, Particularly Martin... and then a harp glissando leads us back seamlessly to the broadway-style chorus music. Niles sits, grinning broadly.\nCHORUS 3\nSoloist 1: (tenor) So if you are stymied to find a prognosis\nSoloist 2: (soprano)And ask yourself, just like Freud:\nSoloist 3: (bass) \"Himmel, was los ist?\"\nFrasier is particularly delighted with the German line.\nSoloist 1: Stop scratching your head, let us cure it instead Daphne and Roz chuckle.\nChoir: (unison) On our show! On our show!\nThe little instrumental riff before \"On our show!\" is different in the three choruses. The following coda sounds as if it has been directly lifted from \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" from \"Mary Poppins.\"\nCODA\nChoir: (single note)Now here is the man to explain The tortured terrain of your brain The man who feels everyone's pain... Dr. Crane! Dr. Crane! Frasier Crane!!\nThe choir finally harmonizes on the last \"Crane.\" Leon's triangle has been featured prominently in the last shouts of \"Dr. Crane.\" The final chord is drawn out in another broadway clich\u00e9, and after the cutoff, Leon provides a final triangle beat. Frasier lowers his baton, extremely proud of his opus.\n[N.B. The piece can be heard on the \"Frasier\" soundtrack CD.]\nRoz: [the only person applauding] Way to go, Leon!\nDaphne begins to applaud with hesitation. Martin is mystified. Kenny has an indescribable look of amazement and sits motionless.\nFrasier: Well, Kenny. What's your reaction?\nKenny's facial expression remains frozen and he is motionless. Finally:\nKenny: [hushed] Wow.\nFrasier: Takes your breath away, doesn't it?\nKenny: [again] Wow.\nFrasier: I thought as much, and in anticipation of your approval, I had the forethought to order in a little bubbly. Niles, if you would help me, please?\nNiles joins Frasier and they run toward a backstage room, delighted.\nFrasier: [to Niles] Oh, you were wonderful!\nNiles: Thank you, the trombone frightened me.\nThey exit.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nKenny: [again, the same] Wow.\nMartin: Well that was sure something, wasn't it?\nDaphne: I'll say. Sort of like Gilbert and Sullivan - only frightening.\nKenny: A little jingle, that's all we wanted. Yeah, ten seconds to start the show.\nRoz: [trying to mediate] Well, maybe Frasier can cut this down...\nKenny: [cutting her off] He gives me harps and drums and... people speaking German. All we wanted was a simple little jingle.\nMartin rises and gets some refreshments.\nDaphne: Probably more like the one you came up with. Tell him yours, Mr. Crane.\nMartin: No, no, no, it was nothing. I can't even remember how it goes.\nDaphne: Well, I do. [singing:] How are you? I'm listen...\nMartin: No, it doesn't go like that.\nKenny: Well, then you sing it, Mr. Crane.\nMartin: Well, all right... but it's really nothing.\nHe moves in front of them and sings his jingle:\nMartin: What's new? I'm listenin' Feelin' blue? I'm listenin'... Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' bad, feelin' glad I'm listenin'!\nKenny: That's exactly the kind of thing we're looking for!\nFrasier and Niles re-enter over Kenny's speech.\nKenny: You know, it sets the mood, it - it says it all. Did that just pop into your head?\nFrasier: [coming up behind him and handing him a glass] Hardly. It was gut-wrenching, but you know, it's nice to know that I made it look easy.\nHe continues to hand out glasses of champagne.\nKenny: No, no, no. I'm talking about your dad's little jingle. Martin beams.\nFrasier: [taken aback] Dad's?\nKenny: Yeah, he just sang it. It's exactly the type of thing we need. You know, simple, catchy...you know, we ought to just use that one.\nMartin seems okay with this.\nFrasier: No, no, Kenny, no. I mean, if simple is what you wanted, you should have just said so.\nKenny: I thought I did.\nFrasier: Well, obviously not. Now that I know what you want, well, there's nothing easier. Of course I can write simple. I promise you, it'll be something far more memorable than what my dad came up with.\nKenny: Well, I don't know, I remember it...sings What's new? I'm listenin'\nSome of the choir members, including the soloists and director, take up the jingle.\nChoir: Feelin' blue? I'm listenin'... Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' bad, feelin' glad I'm listenin'!\nFrasier: [indignant and humiliated] You're off the clock!\nHe exits in a huff.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nIT'S WHY GERSHWIN'S TEETH WERE IMMACULATE\nScene 6 - Frasier's apartment He is seated at the piano playing some ornate classical-style improvisation. He breaks it off and plunks out the last two lines of \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat.\" He places his head in his hand in frustration. Martin enters in his robe.\nMartin: Hey, Fras. How's it goin'?\nFrasier: \"Merrily, merrily.\"\nMartin: Well, you know, it's getting kind of late. Maybe you should call it a night, huh?\nFrasier: Dad, you heard Kenny. I have to come up with something as simple as yours by Monday. By the way, thanks once again for completely upstaging me today.\nMartin: Oh, come on, I'm sorry I stole your thunder, but it's not like I did it on purpose.\nFrasier: I know. I know. I'm sorry. It's just... I don't know why I'm having such a hard time with this.\nMartin: Well... maybe you're just thinking too much. I mean, look at me. I go to the bathroom, I'm flossing my teeth, and that song pops into my head.\nMartin sits at the dining table.\nFrasier: Are you suggesting that I bring out a spool of floss?\nMartin: Well, it might not be a bad idea, for a couple of reasons.\nFrasier joins him at the table.\nMartin: Frasier, why don't you just decide what you want to say and Say it? Not a lot of big words and showing off. You know, and the tune should be something simple - something you can whistle. I tried whistling that thing you wrote today, and I got lightheaded. Of course, it might have been that last doughnut. I went back for one of those African rainsticks. Ooh...\nHe gestures with mild disgust.\nFrasier: The truth is, Dad, I've... I'm not sure I can do simple.\nMartin: Well, I don't know if you can't or if you just don't want to. And you know, some of the best things in the world are simple, Fras. Just like that art gallery you took me to a couple of months ago. Do you remember? You were oohing and ahhing at this painting of a big red dot.\nFrasier: Yeah, Dad, but there is a difference between simple and deceptively simple.\nMartin: Well, all I'm saying is that it's fine to be smart, but you shouldn't have to be proving it all the time, that's all. You know, just as an experiment, tell me what it is you're trying to say stripped down to nuts and bolts.\nFrasier: All right, um... in my first stanza, I want to represent myself as the... ombudsman between the conscious and subconscious minds of my listeners.\nMartin: Ah. Well, there you are, that's the song right there. All we need is a rhyme for \"ombudsman\" and we can go to bed.\nFrasier: Well, I was playing around with \"north woodsman.\"\nMartin laughs gently.\nMartin: Oh, Frasier. Look, I'm going to tell you what your show's\nabout: People have a problem, they're feeling low, they call you, you make them feel better.\nFrasier: Oh, for God's sake, Dad.\nMartin: Well, that's it! That's it. Why don't you just write about that?\nFrasier: How would that sound exactly? [He recites:] If you've got a problem If you're feelin' low Lookin' for some answers... Oh, gosh, now I'm stuck. How will I ever find a rhyme for \"low\"?\nMartin: Okay, smart-aleck. I was just trying to help.\nFrasier: Well, thanks, Dad. I'm sorry, you know, it's just not my thing.\nMartin: Okay, well, I'm going to bed. So, if you need any help tomorrow, all you got to do is ask.\nFrasier: Thanks, Dad.\nMartin exits toward his bedroom. Frasier returns to the piano, waits until he is gone, and sits. He begins to plunk out a catchy melody and sings to it:\nFrasier: If you've got a problem... If you're feelin' low Lookin' for some answers...\nMartin: [completing the verse rhyme and tune from offstage:] Things you need to know\nFrasier looks up, mildly indignant. FADE immediately to...\nScene 7 - KACL We hear a catchy introduction, and then then Frasier's tune, sung in Andrews Sisters-style harmony by a group of female vocalists. Kenny, Roz, and Frasier are leaning over the desk listening to the recorded song.\nVocalists: If you've got a problem If you're feelin' low Lookin' for some answers Things you need to know, All you've got to do is ask (tempo slows) All you've got to do is ask.\nA triangle dings to end the song. Frasier, Kenny, and Roz have been bouncing to the catchy jingle, and Frasier is proud of it, simple as it is.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEND OF ACT II\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nFrasier turns on his stereo and takes out his baton. He begins to conduct. Eddie enters and sits on Martin's chair. Eddie begins to \"sing\" and Frasier continues to conduct. Eddie seems to respond to the baton.

You're notstill upset about the Zucchini Man, are you? I don't evenremember it or him. It was nothing.\nJustin: I know. It's just you being you. I know who youare. I don't expect you to change, in fact, I don't evenwant you to.\nBrian: Then what?\nJustin: Why am I here?\nBrian: One night you're mommy and daddy want to make ababy...\nJustin: You know what I'm mean. It's just you feel guiltyabout what happened? [Pause] Answer me. Answer me! If Ihadn't get bash in the hat would I even be here?\n[Brian doesn't have a quick enough answer to that, andJustin picks up his stuff and stalks off.]\n[Mike's closing the store. Bencomes up.]\nBen: Hey Michael. I was trying to catch you.\nMichael: Well, you caught me.\nBen: Yeah, the class waitin' for you. You never showed.\nMichael: Yeah, the thing is I was really busy. I had youjust called. I'm sorry.\nBen: But I'd like to reschedule. How's Thursday?\nMichael: Well, I'm starting a new business. I don't thinkI have the time.\nBen: Yeah, uh, I think I understand. It was an impositionin the first place.\nMichael: Wait, wait. Look. The truth is I'm not Brainiac.\nBen: Well wait, one of Superman's arch-villains, am Iright? See, I'm learning.\nMichael: I'm impressed. Standing in front of a bunch ofcollege students pretending that I know something isbullshit!\nBen: Why is it bullshit, Michael?\nMichael: Because the Justice League of America isn'texactly Proust or Foucault, or whoever the f*ck they are.\nBen: You could tell them something. What you know is justas valuable. You have this incredible knowledge of gaysemiotics that you don't even realize.\nMichael: Gay what?\nBen: Never mind, it is no matter. The point is you havethis...\nMichael: Passion?\nBen: Irradiate it. It's like the Flynn.\nMichael: Well, that must be why...I'm a little hot.\n[The dungeon.]\nTed: No, no, they're bailing fast.\nEm: Well, what did you expect? Signing up to see ZackO'Tool and instead they get me. They screaming for therunning back.\nTed: And I'm gonna give it to them unless you start doin'something!\n[Emmett lamely waves at the camera.]\nTed: Take something off!\n[Emmett gingerly unbuttons his shirt.]\nTed: Better. Take off you're goddamn pants!\nEm: Alright!\n[Emmett turns his back to the camera, cautiously takesoff his pants and strips down to his black bikiniunderwear.]\nTed: And now you're undies. Good, right. 180 and holding.I think we've stopped the bleeding.\nEm: What do I do now?\nTed: What do you mean? You grab your pud and you pull!\n[Emmett slowly turns around to face the camera.]\nTed: It's starting to grow up.\nEm: So am I.\nTed: Holy sh1t!\nEm: What? What?\nTed: You're bigger than O'Tool! Our subscriber are to,250. OK, keep stroking!\nEm: I always told you I was a grower, not a show-er. Whatwaiting for me to shoot?\nTed: Not yet.\nEm: How much longer?\nTed: 530! Now, now, now! Go, go, go. Shoot, shoot, shoot!\n[He shoots all over himself.]\nTed: Emmett, that's amazing. That is amazing! No one'sever going to know that you used the jizzball.\nTed: What jizzball?\n[Ben's classroom. Mike finallygets to give his lecture.]\nMichael: The male figure has been worshipped fromMichelangelo's David all the way to Captain Astro.\n[There's even a slide show behind him, showing variouscomic book heroes.]\nMichael: The strength and musculare... [he stopps] ofthe... of the...\n[Ben nods at him reassuringly. Mike gives his head ashake and sighs.]\nMichael: I'm sorry, you know what? I haven't a clue whathomoeroticism in literature means, I just know that TheFlash looks good in tights. I start reading Flash andSuperman and Captain America when I was just a kid. Atfirst, because it was fun. I liked the stories, and Iliked the pictures. It was a great escape from all theshit -- uh, sorry, the stuff that was bugging me. And mymom didn't want me to read them. But later at I'mrealised that... later as I'm realised that I was gay Iread them for a different reason. Because, in ways thatmaybe were not intended, these superheroes were a lotlike me. You know, at work they were meek andunderappreciated. They were the guys that never getlaid... [students laughs] And when they're around otherpeople, they can't let anybody get too close for fearthat their true identities would be discovered. Withinall the villians and the monsters and the evil forcesthat are trying to destroy them somehow they're survived.Even the one thing that can kill Superman, one thingwhich he has no immunity, cryptonit, altermately you knowthat he'll survive that and he'll go on and safe theworld. I believe the same about us. That's what thecomics have shown me -- that despite everything, we'llsurvive. And we'll win. But back to the guy in thetights. [class laughs and so Ben.]\n[It's raining in Pittsburgh, andJustin shows up on Debbie's doorstep, drenched to thebone.]\nDebbie: Sunshine! What are you doin' here?\nJustin: You haven't rent my old room, yet?\nDebbie: No, come in here.\n[Cut to Brian at Woody's.]\nDebbie: Hasn't the kid went through enough that you causehim more pain?\nBrian: Stay out of it!\nDebbie: The f*ck I will! I care about him, all you careabout is you're...\nBrian: ...getting my dick sucked. I think that form isestablished. Now Debbie move on from there.\nDebbie: Look, all I want is...\nBrian: ...to interfere?\nDebbie: You can call whatever the f*ck you want. I don'twant Justin hurt.\nBrian: Well, that's life, isn't it? Surprise!\nDebbie: You think you have everybody fooled, don't ya?But not me, honey. I've known you too long. Andregrettably, too well. And no matter how hard you triedto deny it I can tell you care as much about him as hecares about you. Only you haven't the big hairy ball tosay it.\nBrian: Oh, maybe I can borrow your's?\nDebbie: Whatever it takes. To admit that you love him.And I know you do. Despite all your efforts to never letanother heart touch yours, that assume you have one. Thatlittle persistent kid has somehow gotten under the wire.And that's what happen, huh? Admit the truth. You lovehim, don't ya? [Pause] I though so. Then tell him. Tellhim what you could never say to Michael.\n[Babylon!]\nTed: Hey, how about a drink after this hard day work?\n[Ted hands out flyers for the website to all the Hotties,one of whom is checking Emmett out.]\nEm: What that incredible cute guy crusing me?\nTed: Not just cruising. He's in maximum overdrive.\nMan#1: Excuse me, what that you today on the website?\nTed: Oh yeah, it was. And come back and see him onJerkAtWork.net soon.\nMan#1: You're performance was really inspiring. You mindsigning this for me?\nEm: Oh, ok. To Christopher. Thanks for being such...a bigfan..I hope I can live up to it. All my best...love andluck...Emmett. Honeycutt.\nMan#1: Wow, thanks.\n[The man leaves them.]\nTed: My little star. We've get you a p0rn name.\nEm: What's wrong with Emmett Honeycutt?\nTed: No, p0rn lore has it that you're supposed to takethe name of your childhood pet, and add the street thatyou grew up on.\nEm: My favourite mutch war Fetch.\nTed: And the street?\nEm: We live at the corner of Nathan and Dixon.\nTed: Fetch Dixon. A star is...p0rn.\n[The Happy Fun Bedroom. Lindsayflips through another bridal magazine. She decides tocheck out that issue of Oui instead, and flips straightto Melanie's pictures. Melanie eventually catches Lindsaymasturbating to them.]\nMel: I though you didn't like p0rn.\nLindsay: And I like even less thinking about all thosestrange men, and even a few women, looking at you.\nMel: It was a long time ago before I knew you.\nLindsay: Why you didn't have ever told me?\nMel: It's not something really boost about. I practicallyforget about it.\nLindsay: I doesn't like having any secrets. There aren'tmore, are there?\n[Mel shakes her head and pulls off her tank top.]\nMel: I swear. What about you?\nLindsay: Well, there was that time I was a hooker inAlaska. But that was only a summer job.\nMel: I used to have a pretty hot bod.\nLindsay: You still do.\nMel: Why settle for a magazine when you can have the realthing?\n[Babylon! In grainy black andwhite, no less. From the balcony, Brian watches Justinmake out with an Hottie on the dance floor.]\nBrian: Hey.\nJustin: Hey.\nBrian: [to the hottie] Hey, f*ck off!\nJustin: What do you want?\nBrian: You were right. The reason I took you in was thatyou took a bat to the head. But that's not the reasonthat I want you to stay. But don't get the idea we'resome married couple. Cause we're not. We're not, like,f*cking straight people. We're not like you're parents.And we're not a parent dykes marching on the fareways.We're queers, and if we're together, it's because we wantto be, not because there's matching locks on our doors.So if I'm out just assume I'm doin' exactly what I wantto doin'. I'm f*cking. And when I come home, I'm alsodoing what I want to be doing. Coming home to you.\nJustin: OK, I want some things too. You can f*ck whoeveryou want, as long as it is not twice. Same for me. And nonames or numbers exchanged. And no matter where you are,no matter what you're doin' you always come home. Say 2.\nBrian: 4.\nJustin: 3 AM. One more thing. You don't kiss anyone elseon the mouth but me.\n[In response, Brian gives him a big old heartstopper of akiss.]\n[At Ben's home. Ben brings Mike abeer, and a book.]\nMichael: Thanks.\nBen: Oh, I've got something else for ya.\nMichael: R-U-1-2? R-U-1-2, I get it! You're wrote this?You wrote a book?\nBen: Yes, yes, it's me first and last novel. Which thereviewer called \"a noble effort from a fresh newvoice.\" There was on the remainder table soonafterward.\nMichael: I didn't nobody who wrote a book before.\nBen: Open it.\nMichael: \"To Michael. Beneath his mild-manneredappearance beats the heart of a superhero. Ben.\" Idon't know what to say.\n[He gives Ben a hug.]\nBen: So, where were we?\nMichael: About this.\n[They start making out. Kissing. Unbuttoning each other'sshirts. Pants. But Ben suddenly pulls away! Mike'sconfused.]\nBen: Hey, hey, Michael. Wait a minute.\nMichael: What for?\nBen: I just want you to know that...

Meanwhile, Leo receives his punishment from the Elders for his betrayal, and Inspector Sheridan is back on the job and with no memory of what transpired between the sisters and Agent Brody."], "input": "[Scene: Manor. Kitchen. Piper is there talking on the phone while holding a crying Chris. Wyatt is sitting in a highchair.]\nPiper: Yeah, I get that, Rex, but I need you at the club. You're supposed to be there. Valentine's Day is gonna be a very busy night. Can't you ask her to marry you another night?\n(Phoebe walks in.)\nPhoebe: Get off that phone.\nPiper: You know what, I'll handle it. Good luck. (Piper hangs up.) I hope she says no.\nPhoebe: Take a look at this. This is the new face of evil. (She shows Piper a newspaper.) His name is John Normand. He owns the phone company, and he's been stealing from us for months. Doesn't that just make you angry?\nPiper: Not really.\nPhoebe: Wait, he's been stealing from us, and he's probably gonna get away with it due to some loophole or something.\n(Piper puts Chris down on the change table.)\nPiper: Phoebe, I'm a little more worried about the actual demons in the world, you know, the ones we almost got rid of.\nPhoebe: Yeah, there's nothing we can do about them. We tried to save the world, it didn't work. The demons are gonna attack when they're gonna attack.\nPiper: And when they do, we're just gonna be right back to the same old... (Piper takes off Chris' diaper.) Wow!\nPhoebe: Whoa! You're not kidding. Wow!\nPiper: Okeydokey. (Piper puts a new diaper on Chris.) Speaking of which, could you do me a favour and watch the boys tonight? I need Leo to help me set up at P3, and apparently my manager is busy proposing.\nPhoebe: Yeah, sure, of course. It's not like anyone's proposing to me, or like anyone's sending me flowers or reciting me poetry. So much for the little girl I saw in my vision.\nPiper: Well, Phoebe, just because the Avatars are gone doesn't mean that you won't still find love.\nPhoebe: Easy for you to say. You have Leo.\nPiper: Yeah, but do I really? It's only a matter of time before the Elders punish him for becoming an Avatar, which they practically drove him to anyway with Gideon and everything.\nPhoebe: They made Kyle a Whitelighter, and that's good, right?\nPiper: Yeah, but it took him away from Paige. And believe me, they got their cosmic jollies off that one.\nPhoebe: Where is Paige?\nPiper: At Magic School, where else? Why?\nPhoebe: Just worried about her, that's all.\n[Scene: Magic School. Paige and Miss Donovan are there.]\nPaige: It really is another great application.\nMiss Donovan: A muse? No, no, no, no. You can't hire her as the next literature professor. She'll inspire them to write novels instead of reading them.\nPaige: Oh, that's a good point. I hadn't thought of that.\nMiss Donovan: Well, I did. And that's why you should hire me.\nPaige: What? You want to be a teacher?\nMiss Donovan: Well, isn't it time I moved up? Besides, I had a great rapport with the last literature professor.\nPaige: You hated that little gnome, arguing with him five minutes before he was killed.\nMiss Donovan: Well, that was our way. Besides, if the truth were told, he'd want me to have the job. I'm very well-read.\nPaige: It takes more than that, though. It takes being able to really connect with the students.\nMiss Donovan: I can do that. In fact, I've got some tricks you don't even know about.\n(Miss Donovan suddenly disappears and she sits up on the couch near by.)\nPaige: Did you astral project?\nMiss Donovan: Mrs. Winterbourne taught me before she went on sabbatical. Don't worry, I'll get used to it. Trust me. I am the best candidate for this job.\n(The hear a motorbike.)\nPaige: What the hell...\n(A guy on a motorbike suddenly appears and he skids across the floor and slams into a table.)\nDrake: That's gonna leave a mark. Sorry about the table.\nPaige: Are you okay?\n(He turns off the motorbike.)\nMiss Donovan: Who are you?\nDrake: I'm the new teacher.\nOpening Credits\n[Scene: Magic School. Continued from before.]\nMiss Donovan: You ride in here and nearly kill us, and now you want to teach here?\nDrake: If I wanted to teach parallel parking, you might have a point, but I'm here for literature.\nMiss Donovan: And what do you know about literature?\nDrake: Plenty. (He clicks his fingers and a sheet of paper appears in his hand.) My resume.\n(He hands it to Paige.)\nPaige: Drake. Huh. Well, maybe you should have sent this in so you didn't waste your time.\nDrake: Oh, I never waste my time. For life is but a walking shadow, the poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale...\nMiss Donovan: Tale told...\nDrake: Take it, sister.\nMiss Donovan: By an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying...\nDrake: Nothing.\nPaige: You two are not gonna make this easy for me.\nDrake: Come on, what are you talking about? No contest. It's right there on the resume. I studied at Juilliard, performed on Broadway, and I was penning a memoir that I intend to finish on my deathbed.\nMiss Donovan: Oh, I look forward to reading that.\nDrake: Well, thank you very much.\nPaige: Why aren't any of these credits more than a year long?\nDrake: Simple really. Before that I was a demon.\nMiss Donovan: What? A demon?\nDrake: Was a demon. Now human.\nPaige: Okay, and how exactly did that happen?\nDrake: Personally, I hate exposition, but if... All right. Fifty weeks ago I made a deal, the Sorcerer made me human.\nPaige: Just like that?\nDrake: There were a few minor stipulations. First of all, I get to keep my powers, and if I use them in any offensive manner, he gets them, and I burn for all eternity.\nMiss Donovan: What are you waiting for? Vanquish him!\nDrake: Vanq... Lady. Vanquish. I just want a chance to make up for my demon days. If you don't believe me, research me, look into my history. I've got almost nothing to hide.\nMiss Donovan: We'll see about that.\nPaige: Miss Donovan, where are you going?\nMiss Donovan: To prove that he's dangerous.\n(Miss Donovan leaves the room.)\nDrake: If that is safety, then I am dangerous. Boy, is she gonna be sorry when I get the job.\nPaige: Not so fast, Mr. Pompadour Motorcycle Guy. I don't know what to make of you.\nDrake: Why don't we consult the Book of Shadows? Want a ride?\n[Scene: P3. Piper and Leo are there. Piper slaps a cardboard heart onto the wall.]\nPiper: Okay, next.\nLeo: That one's ripped.\nPiper: So? The crowd will be too. Actually, this is taking far too long. Where's my staple gun?\nLeo: Staple gun? Since when do you staple decorations? Don't you want everything to be perfect?\nPiper: What's the point? It's all gonna be torn down tomorrow anyway.\nLeo: The point is not to worry about what's gonna happen tomorrow. The point is to stop and enjoy Valentine's Day.\nPiper: Well, some people can't forget. Some people would rather see the rips and the flaws so that they're not totally devastated when they're all torn down suddenly tomorrow.\nLeo: We're not talking about decorations anymore, are we?\nPiper: Look, Leo, I'm sorry, but I can't just stand here and pretend like everything is not falling apart again. We both know the Elders are not gonna be easy on you.\nLeo: When you change the world, you gotta expect consequences.\nPiper: Says who? The Elders brought this on themselves. It's just as much their fault as it is ours, maybe even more so.\nLeo: Well, I'm the one that chose to become an Avatar. I betrayed them.\nPiper: Because they drove you to it, with Gideon, what he did to Chris and what he tried to do to Wyatt.\nLeo: I don't think they'll see it that way.\nPiper: You need to make them see it that way, or else this may be the last Valentine's Day we spend together.\n[Scene: Underworld. Cave. A Sorcerer and a bounty hunter are there.]\nSorcerer: Your leads are worthless, bounty hunter!\nBounty Hunter: I'm not the one who lost Drake in the first place. That was you, Sorcerer.\nSorcerer: Well, I never dreamt I'd need to keep tabs on him. By now, I thought he would have used his powers for sure.\nBounty Hunter: And yet he hasn't.\nSorcerer: He's stronger than I thought, which is why you must find him so I can force him to give in to temptation.\nBounty Hunter: But we are running out of time.\nSorcerer: In more ways than one, Mr. Rathbone. Zankou is moving in to take over the Underworld. If I expect to stop him and to seize the throne for myself, I must have Drake's powers! I'll double the bounty, but find him.\n(Three demons walk in. Two of the demons are holding onto Miss Donovan and she is struggling to get away.)\nDemon: Sir, excuse me, sir. We have a new lead.\nBounty Hunter: A woman? You call that a lead?\nDemon: We caught her in the Underworld asking about Drake. She may know where he is.\nSorcerer: Ah, is that so?\nMiss Donovan: I don't know anything. Let me go!\n(The Sorcerer holds up a knife.)\nSorcerer: Think harder, my dear.\n[Scene: Manor. Conservatory. Phoebe, Wyatt and Chris are there. Phoebe is on the phone.]\nPhoebe: No, you can not put me on hold again. When are you gonna send me a refund for my phone bill? What do you mean, never? Look, this is... You know what? Forget it. I have call waiting anyway, which you're probably overcharging me for, right? (She presses a button.) Hello?\nDarryl: Hey, Phoebe, it's Darryl.\nPhoebe: Darryl, shouldn't you be out arresting that thief John Normand? Did you read the paper today? It says that...\nDarryl: We got bigger things to worry about. Sheridan's back.\nPhoebe: What? Oh, no. Any more good news?\nDarryl: Your friend Brody came to visit me last night and told me that he brought her out of the coma. Didn't you say he died?\nPhoebe: Yeah, well, I never said it stuck. He became a Whitelighter.\nDarryl: The point is he did some mumbo jumbo on her where she doesn't remember anything that happened.\nPhoebe: Well, does she remember us?\nDarryl: I don't know yet. He told me to tell her that they went on some undercover mission and that he died and she wound up in a coma. Just how long do you expect her to buy that?\nPhoebe: I don't know. But as long as we don't trigger her memory, we should be fine.\nDarryl: What do you mean, trigger?\nPhoebe: Her memory could come back is she's reminded of us. You have to keep her away from us.\nPaige's Voice: Phoebe, I need you upstairs.\nPhoebe: Okay. Coming! Darryl, I'm sorry, I gotta go. You'll have to deal with this like the rest of us.\n(Phoebe hangs up.)\n[Cut to the Police Station.]\nDarryl: Phoebe...\n(Darryl turns around and Sheridan is standing there.)\nSheridan: Phoebe. Do I know her?\nDarryl: I don't know. Do you?\n[Cut to the Manor. Attic. Paige is there with Drake. She is flipping through the Book of Shadows.]\nDrake: See? Right there. You have nothing to fear.\nPaige: What are you talking about? It says that you have the power to fire a thermal blast that can knock out ten demons at a time.\nDrake: Yeah, but I told you. If I use them, then the Sorcerer gets them, and that would be bad. It also says that I can be vanquished by the Power of Three. Hello. See? Right there. (He touches the Book.) What?\nPaige: You touched it.\nDrake: What?\nPaige: You touched the Book.\nDrake: Oh my god, so I did. I guess that means I'm good.\n(He touches the Book again.)\nPaige: Stop it. Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn't. The Book has been tricked before. So have we. Just recently, as a matter of fact.\nDrake: All right, then, that explains it. So what did this mistake cost you? A colleague? A friend? A lover?\nPaige: Actually, all of the above.\nDrake: No wonder you're so indecisive.\nPaige: I'm not indecisive. You think I'm indecisive?\nDrake: Paige, making mistakes is what makes us human.\n(Phoebe walks in.)\nPhoebe: Hey, sorry. I put the boys down for a nap. Who are you?\nDrake: Hi.\nPhoebe: Hi.\nPaige: Drake, Phoebe. Phoebe, Drake. Yeah. He's an ex-demon.\nPhoebe: What? Excuse me?\nDrake: I thought you guys had lots of experience with demons who were human. You married one, didn't you?\nPhoebe: Yes, and divorced. How did you know that?\nDrake: Gossip around the office cauldron. Anyway, the point is, girls, you don't know what it's like to be judged simply by the way you were born. (He clicks his fingers and suddenly he's wearing a French costume.) (in French accent) Look well at me and tell me with what hope this vile protuberance can inspire my heart?\n(Phoebe laughs.)\nPaige: He's very dramatic.\nPhoebe: I see that. I don't know why Cyrano's here but he should probably leave because we have our own problems.\nDrake: But, my dear Roxanne, feel'st thou my soul, here?\nPhoebe: You know, then again, I don't have a date for Valentine's Day. He's kinda hot.\nPaige: He's hot until you figure out how many people he's killed.\nDrake: Wait a minute. I never killed anyone. (He clicks his fingers and returns to his normal clothes.) Except demons. Killed plenty of them.\nPhoebe: Join the club. It sucks, doesn't it?\nPaige: You're telling me in your whole demonic career, you have not killed one innocent?\nDrake: That's because since the day I was hatched, I've been reading books, and they taught me about feelings, human feelings, love, sadness, death. Since then I could never harm an innocent. I always found a way around doing that.\nPaige: (to Phoebe) What do you think?\nPhoebe: I kind of believe him. You?\nPaige: I don't know. I'm gonna ask Piper.\nDrake: Come on, Paige, tell her I'm the right man for the job.\nPhoebe: Job? What job?\nPaige: Fill her in. I'll be back.\n(Paige orbs out.)\nDrake: So you like Gene Kelly movies?\nPhoebe: Love 'em. Why?\n[Scene: On top of Golden Gate Bridge. Leo is waiting there. Two Elders orb in.]\nLeo: Thanks for coming.\nSandra: Of course. After all that's happened, it's the least we could do.\nKheel: Oh, please, don't apologise. If anything, we've been far too lenient with him.\nLeo: Lenient? You tried to kill me.\nKheel: You left us no choice.\nLeo: Funny, I feel the same way.\nSandra: Gentlemen, neither side is without blame. Perhaps we could put the past behind us.\nKheel: And we will... once he's done the penance for his betrayal.\nLeo: That's why I brought you here. I should be able to defend myself before you issue judgment.\nKheel: Really? And what would you say?\nLeo: That what I did was for my family. I was trying to create a better world for them, for all of us.\nKheel: Too bad you failed.\nSandra: Perhaps it would be best if Leo and I spoke alone, if you don't mind. (Kheel orbs out.) It hasn't been easy arguing on your behalf.\nLeo: Thanks for trying.\nSandra: One word of advice, Leo. Stay out of magical affairs. Or you just might make things even worse for yourself.\n[Scene: Manor. Parlor. Drake is there dancing. Phoebe walks down the stairs.]\nPhoebe: Wow, let me get this straight. You do musical theatre as well?\nDrake: Oh, I'm full of surprises.\n(He clicks his fingers and Phoebe is suddenly dressed in a white dress and black vest.)\nPhoebe: What's this?\nDrake: Another surprise. (He takes her hands and they start dancing.) Happy Valentines Day.\nPhoebe: And to you.\n(They lean in to kiss but Piper and Paige walk in and interrupts them.)\nPiper: Get your paws off of her!\nDrake: So much for romance.\nPhoebe: Piper. (Phoebe giggles.) We were just having fun. You know, fun.\nPiper: With the demon? Phoebe, how many times have I told you not to play dress up with the demons.\nPaige: I'm sure it's harmless.\nDrake: Incidentally, Piper, I am an ex-demon.\nPiper: Look, buddy, we're not gonna let a demon or an ex-demon teach at Magic School. It's ridiculous.\nPaige: Maybe you're right. Drake, I'm really sorry. It's just not a real feasible thing for you to do. It could cause too many problems.\nDrake: Oh, no, you're making a terrible mistake. As an ex-demon, I can get through to these kids, I can keep them from going down the path of evil. Phoebe, talk to them, make them see reason.\nPhoebe: I can't. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it just... it's not really practical. I'm sorry.\nDrake: This is all wrong. The problem here isn't me. It's you three. You're shaken by the core by what's happened with the Avatars. (to Paige) You, you just lost faith in yourself, (to Phoebe) and you, you've been disheartened by the fight. (to Piper) And you, sweetheart, are just plain mean.\n(Piper laughs.)\nPiper: Watch it.\n(Paige giggles.)\nDrake: You're mean because you closed down your heart. You're petrified it's gonna get broken again, aren't you? You know, there's only one man I know who can solve all of these problems. (He clicks his fingers and Piper and Paige are suddenly dressed in leather, Phoebe is dressed in a white gown with long red hair, and Drake is dressed as Robin Hood.) Well, come on, Robin Hood.\nPaige: You, I'm gonna hire you just so I can fire you.\nPiper: Do we look merry to you?\nDrake: Well, perhaps you should see the world as Robin Hood would have. He believed in himself, also loved the thrill of the fight. And despite the threat of imminent death, he found love with his dear Maid Marian.\n(He kisses Phoebe's hand.)\nPhoebe: That's very sweet. Isn't that... You should probably change us back.\nDrake: Very well.\n(Drake clicks his fingers and they change back to their normal clothes.)\nPiper: Kitchen, now, let's go.\n(The girls head for the kitchen.)\nPhoebe: (to Drake) You just give me one second.\n(The Sorcerer shimmers in behind Drake.)\nDrake: I thought they'd never leave.\n[Cut to the kitchen.]\nPhoebe: Vanquish him? Are you sure?\nPiper: Well, if he doesn't leave, we don't have a choice.\nPhoebe: But his heart is in the right place.\n[Cut back to the parlor.]\nSorcerer: Now, let's see those powers, demon.\n[Cut to the kitchen.]\nPaige: On the other hand, he still has his demonic powers.\nPiper: Hi, waffle much?\n(They hear a crash from the other room.)\n[Cut to the parlor. Drake falls to the floor. The Sorcerer is standing over him with his arms outstretched. Drake is glowing red.]\nSorcerer: \"Darkness within cannot be undone. Embrace your true self.\"\n(Piper, Phoebe and Paige run in.)\nPiper: Here we go again.\n(Piper tries to blow him up and he flies across the room and hits the wall.)\nSorcerer: Damn it!\n(He shimmers out.)\nPhoebe: Drake. Are you okay?\n(She runs over to him.)\nDrake: Drake? Who's Drake? I'm Robin... of Locksley.\nPaige: Of course you are.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Manor. Dining Room. Drake jumps around the corner wielding a bow and arrow.]\nDrake: Stand and deliver! (He aims for an apple but the arrow misses and hits a pillow.) Excellent. (He reaches for another arrow. Piper walks in.) John will be no match for me.\nPiper: Robin, you missed. And if you put a hole in my wall, you'll have me to answer to, not some prince.\nDrake: My apologies, my good woman, but my aim must be true if I am to right John's wrongs.\nPiper: Right. Just be careful. (Piper walks into the conservatory where Phoebe and Paige are sitting at a table. Phoebe is flipping through the Book of Shadows.) Please tell me you found a way to fix Robin in there.\nPhoebe: Not yet. Can't you just freeze him?\nPiper: Nope. Not freezing.\nPaige: I'm sorry, you guys. Another big mistake bringing him here.\nPhoebe: No, it's just our lives. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.\nPaige: Yeah, but I don't understand why it went wrong. Why does the Sorcerer want to turn Drake into Robin Hood, of all things?\nPiper: I don't think he meant to. I think he meant to bring out Drake's inner demon so he could use his powers. But then I blasted him mid-spell, so instead we got his inner Robin Hood.\nDrake: Royal hound! (He shoots another arrow and it smashes a vase of flowers.) Sorry, my fault.\nPaige: Another mistake for the Charmed Ones.\nPiper: It was an accident.\nPaige: Either way, we messed up.\nPhoebe: Okay. I found a vanquishing potion for the Sorcerer, but of course, there's no way to find him.\nPaige: How is finding the Sorcerer even gonna fix Drake anyway?\nPiper: Actually, I think it will because, if we vanquish the Sorcerer, then it should reverse his magic.\nDrake: Saxon dog!\nPaige: Okay, well, I'll go to the Magic School, and I'll ask Miss Donovan to look through things and see if she can find something that helps us find the Sorcerer.\nPhoebe: Or you could just do it yourself.\nPaige: Yeah, well, I don't know the archives that well. And, knowing me, I'd probably mess up.\n(Paige orbs out.)\nPhoebe: What are we gonna do with her?\nPiper: We'll fix her later. Right now, we need to deal with him.\n(They hear a crash and Drake slides along the dining room table. He picks up a sheet of paper.)\nPhoebe: What is he doing with my phone bill?\n(They rush over to him.)\nDrake: Marian, these taxes are outrageous. Prince John has gone too far.\nPhoebe: Okay, I'm not Marian, I'm Phoebe, remember? And give me that!\n(She snatches the phone bill off him.)\nPiper: Prince John has been dead for centuries. He's not taxing anyone anymore.\nPhoebe: Yeah. The phone company is owned by a different John, and he's, well, a really swell guy.\nDrake: Nonsense. The evidence of his misdeeds is right there on the parchment.\n(He points to the newspaper.)\nPiper: You left that out?\nPhoebe: Who knew?\nDrake: I think it's high time I paid John a visit. My steed! (He clicks his fingers and a motorbike appears.) Horsepower.\nPiper: What kind of Robin Hood rides a motorcycle?\nPhoebe: Forget that. What are we gonna do? We can't just let him go out there. Especially not with Sheridan back.\nPiper: Sheridan's back?\nPhoebe: Did I forget to mention that?\nPiper: Go with him.\nPhoebe: What?\nPiper: You're the Marian person. Go with him.\nPhoebe: Robin, wait. (Phoebe sits on the bike behind Drake.) Here we go. (He hands her his bow.) Oh, okay.\nPiper: Helmets please, people.\n(Helmets suddenly appear on their heads.)\nDrake: Hold on, milady.\n(The front doors fly open and they ride out of the manor.)\n[Cut to outside a building. Drake and Phoebe pull up on the motorbike.]\nPhoebe: Okay, well, no Prince John here. We should probably go home, huh?\nDrake: And give up without a fight? I think not. Those riches belong to the people of Sherwood Forest. We must see they're returned.\nPhoebe: I know. But we can't just steal from the rich and give to the poor. There's laws against that.\nDrake: Marian, have you forgotten what it is to do good?\n(They walk inside the building. There is a long line of people waiting inside. Drake walks past the line of people.)\nMan: Hey, that guy's cutting.\n(A man stops Drake.)\nMan #2: Hey, hey, Pocahontas. There's a line.\nDrake: Little John. You came to join our merry band. Excellent.\nMan #2: Who are you calling little?\nOffice Manager: Excuse me.\nMan #2: You want to fight me? Is that it?\n(Phoebe rushes up to them.)\nPhoebe: No, no, no, no. No, Robin.\nDrake: You've put on a bit of girth.\nOffice Manager: Excuse me. I'm the office manager here. Is there a problem?\nMan #2: This nutjob's trying to butt in line.\nPhoebe: He doesn't know any better.\n(Drake walks up to the office manager and grabs him by his tie.)\nDrake: You will tell me where Prince John is.\nOffice Manager: Who?\nDrake: Prince John.\nPhoebe: Okay, we don't want to kill the peasants. That's not what we do.\nDrake: He is no peasant. He's an accomplice to the prince's thievery.\nOffice Manager: What? I didn't steal anything.\nMan #2: The hell you didn't. I read the paper. I know you've been screwing us. Thanks to you, I can't afford to take my wife out for Valentine's Day.\nWoman: That's nothing. They cut off my phone service for no reason. And now they want to charge me to re-connect it.\nMan #3: What about their lousy technicians? I wasted a day of work waiting on them.\nMan #2: See, you're making all our lives miserable. Kick his ass, Robin!\nPhoebe: No, just tell him where John Normand is. That's all he wants to know.\nOffice Manager: Headquarters, financial district.\nPhoebe: Great, we'll find it. Come on.\nOffice Manager: Just don't tell him I sent you.\n(Phoebe leaves.)\nDrake: Good people of Sherwood, the prince has abused his power for far too long. He lives in riches while you live in squalor.\nMan #2: Yeah!\nDrake: It is high time we take back that which was stolen from you. All of those who wish to join my fight, you follow me!\nEveryone: Yeah!\n[Cut to outside. A security guard is standing near a Armored Services truck holding up a gun. Suddenly an arrow flies through the air and knocks the gun out of his hand. Drake walks out of the building pointing the bow and arrow.]\nDrake: Stand down if you know what's good for you.\n(Drake goes over to the Armored Services truck. Phoebe walks out of the building.)\nPhoebe: Hey! What are you doing?\nDrake: Marian, you're just in time. To the end of Prince John's tyranny!\n(He grabs some money out of the truck and throws it into the air. Everyone runs to try catch it.)\nPhoebe: You can't do this!\nDrake: Look what the prince has done to these people. How can you turn a blind eye to that? Or has your heart really grown that cold? Fill your hearts and fill your bellies!\n(Sirens are heard.)\nPhoebe: The police are coming. We gotta go. Let's go. (She pushes through the crowd.) Excuse me.\n(The Sorcerer is watching near by.)\n[Scene: Underworld. Cave. Miss Donovan is shackled to the wall. Her astral projected self is trying to unlock the shackles. The Sorcerer stands behind her, watching.]\nMiss Donovan: Oh, please. Please...\nSorcerer: So you can astral project. That could come in very handy later. (He pokes her and she astral projects back into her body.) Morning, sunshine.\nMiss Donovan: What do you want with me?\nSorcerer: I'm afraid I couldn't bring the demon out of Drake as I'd planned. I was interrupted by the Charmed Ones.\nMiss Donovan: Then they'll probably come for you.\nSorcerer: Which is why I need you to serve as a distraction when the time is right.\nMiss Donovan: Oh, why did I ever come down here? I should have stayed in the library.\nSorcerer: The library? Well, then you are indeed a prize.\nMiss Donovan: Why? What do you mean?\nSorcerer: The witches' interference made my spell go awry. Drake is unstable now, and I need to use this to my advantage. So tell me... what do you know about Robin Hood?\n[Scene: Manor. Kitchen. Piper is making a potion and on the phone.]\nPiper: No, Phoebe, you can't take him to John Normand's office. That is a very bad idea. You have to bring him back here. I said you have to bring him back here! Phoebe. Phoebe! Damn it. (She hangs up. Leo walks in.) Do I really need this today? Or ever?\nLeo: Relax. You can handle it.\nPiper: This coming from the man who refuses to help.\nLeo: I told you, I'm afraid that I'm gonna piss off the Elders, and they can recycle me, Piper. You don't want that, do you?\nPiper: No, of course not. But it's just, we were this close to a life without Elders, without demons, without freaking Robin Hood running through the streets, threatening to expose us.\nLeo: I know, but this is the life that we have now, and have to make the best out of it, okay? So relax, you can handle it, just like you've done before.\nPiper: Thank you, and don't remind me.\n(Paige orbs in.)\nPaige: Have you guys seen the news?\nPiper: No. Weren't you at Magic School?\nPaige: Yeah! We have satellite.\n(Paige turns on the TV in the kitchen.)\nNews Reporter: He apparently threw the stolen cash into the crowd, inciting a near riot. Police have launched a search for the man who bystanders described as a modern-day Robin Hood.\n(Paige turns off the TV.)\nPiper: Still think I can handle this one?\nLeo: Just like the good old days.\nPiper: Bite your tongue.\nPaige: Okay, you know what? I should go warn Darryl. Because the cops have no idea what they're up against.\nPiper: No, no, no. Wait. I need you to write a vanquishing spell.\nPaige: Why? You have the potion.\nPiper: Not for the Sorcerer, for Drake.\nPaige: For Drake? Really?\nPiper: We need to be able to stop him. And this may be the only way. Leo, can you warn Darryl?\nLeo: What about the Elders?\nPiper: Oh, for God's sake. I don't think they'll strike you down for making a phone call.\nLeo: Right.\nPaige: You know what? I found a spell at Magic School and it should be able to summon the Sorcerer. That way we don't have to vanquish Drake.\nPiper: You mean Miss Donovan found it?\nPaige: No. I found it. Come to think of it, I haven't actually seen Miss Donovan in a little while. Look, anyway, the point is, with my spell, we can summon the Sorcerer. With your potion we can vanquish him and that kind of fixes the whole Drake thing, yeah?\nPiper: Maybe, but if that doesn't work, we need a plan B. We've gotta stop Drake somehow.\nPaige: Well, I guess it can't hurt.\nPiper: Exactly. The last thing we need is another news report like that one.\n[Scene: Police Station. Darryl is on the phone.]\nDarryl: He's a what?\nLeo: An ex-demon. But he still has powers, so be careful. You don't want the cops to provoke him too much. He could take out half the force.\nDarryl: If Sheridan finds out, that could be a trigger.\nLeo: Sorry?\nDarryl: For her memory. If she remembers she was after them, then she'll be all over us again.\nLeo: Oh, then, you can't let her find out.\nDarryl: Thanks for the tip, Leo.\n(Darryl hangs up. He grabs his coat. Sheridan walks up to him.)\nSheridan: Good news, lieutenant. The captain wants us to work together. So where are we going, partner?\n[Scene: Street. Phoebe and Drake are there. They cross the road in front of a cab. He slams on his breaks.]\nCab Driver: Hey, what's the matter with you, moron!\nPhoebe: So we're just gonna talk to the guy, right? We're not actually gonna kill him.\nDrake: No, of course not. As long as he promises to give back every last penny.\nPhoebe: What do you mean, every last penny? Look, I don't think this is a good idea.\nDrake: Marian, you've come so far. You must be strong enough to finish the fight, for those who cannot fight for themselves. Do not let all we've done be for naught.\n(They hear a siren. Darryl and Sheridan pull up.)\nPhoebe: Darryl.\nDrake: The sheriff of Nottingham. It's about time he arrived.\nSheridan: Freeze!\n(She points her gun. Drake shoots an arrow at her and it hits her in the arm.)\nPhoebe: Sheridan!\n(Phoebe runs over to her.)\nDrake: Marian! Marian!\nPhoebe: Oh my god. Are you okay?\n(Sheridan grabs Phoebe.)\nSheridan: Yeah, I'm fine. But you're under arrest. (to Darryl) Where's the other one?\nDarryl: He got away.\n[Cut to inside a building. Office. John Normand is there. Drake kicks open the door.]\nDrake: Prince John! We meet at last.\nJohn: What the hell is this?\n(Drake points his bow and arrow at John.)\nDrake: The end of your reign.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: John Normand's Office. Continued from before.]\nJohn: You'll never make it out of here, you know that. I mean, the cops will have you inside of two minutes.\nDrake: You need not worry about me, sire.\nJohn: What exactly do you want from me? Did my ex-wife send you?\nDrake: I'm here to rob you.\nJohn: Of course. Well, in that case, we'd better get right to it, and you can be on your merry way. Now, who should I make this out to?\nDrake: You will return all that you have stolen to every last person in your domain.\nJohn: But I have millions of customers.\nDrake: Then I suggest you get started.\n[Cut to outside. Police cars have pulled up. Darryl is talking on a walkie talkie.]\nDarryl: Hold your position, and nobody make a move unless I say so. (He walks over to Phoebe and Sheridan. Sheridan is holding a cloth up to her arm.) You should really get that wound checked.\nSheridan: No, thanks. I've missed enough. Miss Halliwell here was just telling me a very interested story.\nPhoebe: Wait, you don't believe me?\nSheridan: I think it's a little far-fetched, don't you think? You get kidnapped by Robin Hood, forced to go on a crime spree, only to be saved in the end by us. That's a nice touch.\nDarryl: Let her go, Sheridan. She's a friend.\nPhoebe: Hey, you know what? Sheridan, I'm a good person. And I really think that I can help you out in this situation if you'd just let me.\nDarryl: Do you really think you can?\nPhoebe: Yeah, I do. He and I have a connection. He's a little messed up right now, but I really think I could break through to him. But I gotta talk to him.\nSheridan: That's completely out of the question. It's dangerous, and it breaks procedure.\nPhoebe: You know what? He's dangerous. You have no idea what he's capable of.\nMan's Voice: (on walkie talkie) Lieutenant, we're in position. We've got a clear shot.\nDarryl: Hold your fire. (to Sheridan) She's going in.\nSheridan: What? Morris...\nDarryl: That's an order, inspector.\nPhoebe: Thank you, Darryl.\n(Sheridan uncuffs Phoebe and Phoebe runs off.)\nSheridan: You know, there's something oddly familiar about all this.\nDarryl: You should get that wound checked.\n[Scene: Manor. Attic. Piper and Paige are sitting around a table. There are five lit candles on the table.]\nPaige: \"Sorcerer of darkness, demon of fright, I call you now into my sight.\" (Nothing happens.) Maybe I can just try it again.\nPiper: No, Paige, you've tried three times. It's not working. He must be protecting himself somehow.\nPaige: I could have copied it down wrong.\nPiper: Paige, it's not your first day as a witch. It's just... We're running out of options. You saw the news. I think it's time we go to plan B.\nPaige: I think getting rid of him would be a big mistake.\nPiper: So would letting an innocent die. Look, if you're not gonna trust yourself, at least trust me because it's certainly not my first day.\n(Miss Donovan astral projects in.)\nMiss Donovan: Paige.\nPaige: Miss Donovan! Why are you astral projecting?\nMiss Donovan: Later. I don't have time. The Sorcerer took me prisoner.\nPiper: What?\nMiss Donovan: I swear, I was just trying to check out Drake. It turns out he's not so bad. It was the Sorcerer that I should have been worried about.\nPaige: It's okay, we know all about it. Don't panic. Now that we know where you are, we can scry for you and get you out of there and just vanquish him.\nMiss Donovan: Oh, thank you. Now I gotta go.\n(She astral projects out.)\nPiper: Looks like Drake just got a reprieve.\n[Cut to the Underworld. Cave. The Sorcerer is watching the attic through a crystal ball.]\nSorcerer: Well played, my dear.\nMiss Donovan: I wish I could have told them what you were planning.\nSorcerer: If you had, you'd be dead by now. At least now, you'll live a touch longer than the Charmed Ones will. You see, thanks to your message, they're not focused on saving you. Too bad my lair is protected against summoning and scrying.\nMiss Donovan: It won't take them long to figure it out.\nSorcerer: But by then I'll have Drake's powers.\nMiss Donovan: How can you be so sure?\nSorcerer: Well, you see, once a demon, always a demon. I just need to remind Drake of that, by casting a spell on Prince John.\n[Scene: John Normand's Office. John is writing out checks.]\nJohn: Come on, you cannot expect me to write all these checks.\n(Phoebe comes in. Drake points his bow and arrow at her.)\nPhoebe: Oh, Robin, don't shoot! It's me, your Marian.\nDrake: Milady, how did you elude the sheriff?\nPhoebe: Oh, me and the sheriff go way back. Now listen. Don't you think it's time we let the prince go? I'm sure he's learned his lesson by now, haven't you, John?\nJohn: Oh, oh, yeah. I'm... I'm heartbroken here, man. I didn't realise what I was doing to those poor people. Thank you, Robin. You have really shown me the error of my ways. I swear, I am going to change.\nPhoebe: See? That's great, that's great. I know you don't want to hurt him.\nDrake: What about the money? He can't be trusted.\nPhoebe: Well, if you can't trust him, then trust me. Look, today you reminded me what it's like to do good, to make a difference and to help people. Now let me help you. Come with me, before you do something you'll regret.\nDrake: Sorry.\n(John briefly glows red.)\nJohn: Oh, I cannot believe that you actually fell for that.\nDrake: What?\nJohn: Oh, really. Do you think I give a rat's ass about some poor schmo who's too stupid to know he's been suckered? There's no way in hell I'm giving this money back.\nPhoebe: Oh, no, the Sorcerer.\n[Scene: Manor. Conservatory. Piper, Paige and Leo are there. Piper is scrying.]\nLeo: I don't think Darryl can hold off the cops any longer. You're running out of time.\nPiper: What would you like me to do? The crystal's not dropping.\nPaige: This isn't right. We're being played.\nPiper: Come on, Paige, you're not gonna do any of us any good by waffling now.\nPaige: I'm not waffling. Look. Fine, I admit, okay. I've been out of it since the whole thing with the Avatars and with Kyle. But I can't keep beating myself up over the mistakes that we've made. I have to move on. I think we all do.\nPiper: I'm not sure it's that easy.\nPaige: Maybe not but I have to try, right? Drake said that I have to start trusting my instincts again. Otherwise, I'm not gonna be able to help him or Miss Donovan or anybody.\nLeo: So what are your instincts telling you?\nPaige: That Miss Donovan's just a distraction. Otherwise, we would have found her by now.\nPiper: Okay, say you're right. So you think the Sorcerer is after Drake?\nPaige: He wants his powers, doesn't he? Drake's bound to use those at some point or another.\n[Scene: John Normand's Office. Drake has his bow and arrow pointed at John.]\nDrake: You will give the money back.\nJohn: Or what? You're gonna shoot me with an arrow? Come on. I'm evil. You can do better than that.\nPhoebe: Don't listen to him. He's under a spell.\nJohn: You gotta punish me, destroy me, or I'll keep doing evil. And I don't give a damn who gets hurt. Single mums, old people, kids, even your little maid here!\n(Drake throws down the bow and arrow.)\nDrake: She's not my maid!\n(Drake throws fireballs at John and he is knocked through the window. John grabs onto the window sill and hangs onto it from the outside of the building.)\nDarryl: (from the street) My god.\nJohn: Help me, please.\n(Phoebe grabs John's arm and tries to pull him up.)\nPhoebe: I gotcha. I gotcha.\n(Drake turns back to his normal self. The Sorcerer appears in the chair.)\nSorcerer: Hello.\n[Cut to the manor. Conservatory. Leo sees the news on the TV.]\nLeo: Looks like your instincts were right.\nNews Reporter: (on TV) We believe that John Normand is being hurled out of that window by some...\nPaige: Just wish I trusted them sooner.\n[Cut to John Normand's Office.]\nSorcerer: A deal is a deal. (The Sorcerer holds out his hands and Drake glows red. The Sorcerer absorbs Drake's powers.) You, off to purgatory, my boy. (Drake is engulfed in flames. Piper and Paige orb in. Drake disappears.) Well, what are you waiting for? Come and get me.\n(He shimmers out.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Manor. Conservatory. Leo is there with Wyatt and Chris.]\nNews Reporter: (on TV) This was the scene of chaos, just minutes ago when the man known as Robin Hood detonated what appears to have been a homemade bomb. Fortunately, billionaire John Normand escaped injury with the aide of local advice columnist Phoebe Halliwell.\n(Piper, Phoebe and Paige orb in.)\nPhoebe: Piper, we don't have a choice. We have to go after the Sorcerer.\nPiper: I realise that, but he knows we're coming. He'll set a trap for us.\nLeo: What happened? The news said Drake was missing.\nPaige: No, actually, we lost him.\nPhoebe: But if we vanquish the Sorcerer, we should be able to reverse the magic and get Drake out of purgatory.\nPaige: Well, if we can use the vanquishing spell I wrote to get rid of Drake, then it should work on getting rid of the Sorcerer.\nPiper: How can you be sure it'll work?\nPaige: I trust my gut. Helped us find the Sorcerer, right?\nPhoebe: And it was right about Drake. He is an innocent. We have to save him, otherwise everything he's done will have been for naught.\nPiper: For naught?\nPhoebe: The point is is we have to save Drake.\nPiper: I don't know, I think Drake's caused enough trouble for one day.\nLeo: I'll say. We'll be lucky if he doesn't trigger Sheridan's memory.\nPiper: Not to mention Prince John and all the magic he saw.\nPhoebe: Okay, John won't remember a thing. We can worry about Sheridan tomorrow.\nPiper: You worry tomorrow. I'll worry today.\n(Paige scrys for Miss Donovan. The crystal lands on a spot on the map.)\nPaige: Found Miss Donovan. Probably the Sorcerer too.\nPiper: See? Wasn't that a little too easy? I'm telling you, it's a trap.\nPhoebe: Maybe we should start thinking more like Robin Hood.\nPiper: Excuse me?\n[Scene: Underworld. The Sorcerer's Lair. The Sorcerer and Miss Donovan are there.]\nSorcerer: It won't be long now. I've lowered the cave's protections, which means the Charmed Ones are on their way.\nMiss Donovan: To vanquish you, I'm sure.\nSorcerer: Oh, I'm sure they'll try. But we're on my turf now. And they'll be no match for my new powers.\n(Another Miss Donovan appears in the room.)\nMiss Donovan #2: I'm not so sure about that.\nSorcerer: Well, well, well. I'll give you this much. You're getting better at that. You don't even need to be asleep anymore.\nMiss Donovan: I'm a fast learner.\nMiss Donovan #2: Me too.\nSorcerer: Well, that's wonderful, but I don't think I have time for this right now.\n(A third Miss Donovan astral projects in the room.)\nMiss Donovan #3: You should make time.\nSorcerer: What the hell?\nMiss Donovan #3: Because you never know...\n(Another Miss Donovan appears in the room.)\nMiss Donovan #4: It's true. You never know when your time is up.\nSorcerer: The Charmed Ones.\nMiss Donovan #4: \"Evil blast we cannot use.\"\n(The three extra Miss Donovan's change into Piper, Phoebe and Paige.)\nPiper, Phoebe, Paige: \"The power of three now lights the fuse.\"\n(The Sorcerer is engulfed in flames. He screams and disappears.)\nPiper: Nicely done.\nPaige: What about Drake?\n(Drake appears.)\nDrake: Ow, that's hot! That's not gonna...\nPhoebe: Drake.\nDrake: You saved me?\nPhoebe: Of course. What would you expect from Maid Marian?\nPaige: And your Merry Men.\nPiper: Women.\nMiss Donovan: Excuse me? Do you mind?\n(Paige goes over to Miss Donovan.)\nPhoebe: That was interesting, huh?\nPiper: I guess. I just can't believe we're back in the Underworld, back vanquishing demons again.\n(Paige is having trouble getting the chains off Miss Donovan.)\nDrake: I don't know. After all, it is pretty romantic, isn't it?\nPiper: You've gotta be kidding.\nDrake: No, not at all. (Drake clicks his fingers and Miss Donovan is freed from the chains.) Most of the world's greatest lovers were brought together during a time of epic conflict. Most of them were doomed, but they did find the romance in it. So why can't you?\n[Scene: Police Station. Darryl and Sheridan are there. Sheridan is looking at the front page of the paper. It reads \"Ask Phoebe A Hero\".]\nSheridan: Hey. Thought you might want to see this.\nDarryl: A hero. Now, aren't you glad you didn't arrest her?\nSheridan: Oh, I don't know. She didn't help us get the guy.\nDarryl: She didn't promise to. She promised to help.\nSheridan: Yeah, but still, don't you think it's just a little weird? I mean, she goes inside, the perp gets away, but yet there's no trail to follow, no leads. I mean, it's almost as though he just disappeared.\nDarryl: We'll get him. Good night, Sheridan.\n[Scene: Magic School. Paige walks into the library. Drake is there wearing suit.]\nPaige: Oh, you look great in all your teacher-ness.\nDrake: Oh, that little old thing?\nPaige: Okay, well, I've brought you your class schedule and your student roster. And I have assigned you a TA. Miss Donovan.\nDrake: She's not sore for being passed over?\nPaige: She got freaked out by what happened. She did want to run back to the library, but I've talked her into helping you out in the class.\nDrake: I guess it's all for the best. Someone's gotta take over.\nPaige: What, are you planning on being absent a lot?\nDrake: In case it doesn't work out. We agreed it would be temporary at first. You may change your mind in a couple of weeks. I may need to move on.\nPaige: I will not change my mind, trust me. Anybody who can get though the thick skulls of my lovely sisters and I can definitely get though to those kids.\nDrake: Even though I'm a little crazy?\nPaige: Because you are a lot crazy. No, look, Magic School's protected. It's okay. Give it your best shot.\n(Phoebe walks in.)\nPhoebe: Hey.\nDrake: Hey.\nPhoebe: I just came by to see the new professor.\nPaige: All right, well, I promised Piper and Leo that I'd babysit for them tonight. They're going out celebrating Valentine's Day.\nDrake: Finding a little romance?\nPaige: Thanks to you, yeah.\nDrake: Oh, I'm not done yet.\nPhoebe: Really?\nPaige: Okay, well, great, awkward moment for me. So I'll be going. There's a night class in five minutes. Don't forget.\n(Paige leaves.)\nPhoebe: So I thought you'd like to see tomorrow's newspaper. (She hands him the paper.) Looks like Prince John is gonna give back everything he stole. Guess he just needed to be reminded of his mortality.\nDrake: Works every time. Phoebe, there's something I have to tell you. The deal I made that made me human, that only lasts a year. At the end of it, I gotta die.\n(Phoebe giggles.)\nPhoebe: What...? Are you kidding?\nDrake: No. Uh-uh. But listen, it was well worth the sacrifice.

{"instructions": ["Write a summary for the scene."], "outputs": ["Rebecca Adler (Robin Tunney), a 29-year-old kindergarten teacher, becomes dysphasic and collapses in her classroom. Dr. Gregory House initially refuses the case until Dr. James Wilson tells him that Rebecca is his cousin. When Dr. Lisa Cuddy tries to make House fulfill his clinical duties, he refuses but is forced to do them when his authorization to the MRI is revoked. He diagnoses Rebecca with cerebral vasculitis and her condition improves with treatment. To find the source of Rebecca's seizures, House convinces Dr. Eric Foreman to break into Rebecca's house. At the hospital, Rebecca suddenly loses her vision and suffers another seizure. Foreman discovers ham at Rebecca's house, revealing both Wilson's lie (Wilson is Jewish and the presence of ham indicates Rebecca is not, thereby suggesting the two are not related) and the cause of the seizure-tapeworms (namely, a tapeworm larva embedded in her brain). When Rebecca refuses treatment, House persuades her otherwise by proving her condition with a non-invasive X-ray suggested by Dr. Robert Chase, which depicts a tapeworm larva embedded in her leg, supporting their diagnosis. Final diagnosis: Neurocysticercosis"], "input": "[Rebecca riding bus and then running into a school. Meets up with Melanie]\nMelanie: Why are you late?\nRebecca: You're not going to like the answer.\nMelanie: I already know the answer.\nRebecca: I missed the bus.\nMelanie: I don't doubt it, no bus stops near Brad's. You spent the night, the alarm didn't work. Or maybe it did.\nRebecca: I didn't sleep with him.\nMelanie: Girl, there's...[Interrupted]\nRebecca: I missed the bus!\nMelanie: There's something either very wrong with you, or there's something very wrong with him.\nRebecca: There's nothing wrong with him.\nMelanie: Please tell me you know that for a fact.\nRebecca: Melanie, I gotta go.\nMelanie: You're lying aren't you?\nRebecca: I wouldn't lie to you. [Turns to class of 5 year olds] Good morning guys!\nClass: Good morning Miss Rebecca!\nRebecca: Everybody's in their seats?\nClass: Yes!\nRebecca: Ok, Sidney, why don't you tell us what you did this weekend. Come on, Sidney, we know you're not shy.\nSidney: How come we always have to tell you what we did, and you never tell us what you did?\nClass: [giggles]\nRebecca: Ok, I had a really great weekend, but you can't tell Miss Melanie, ok?\nSidney: What did you do?\nRebecca: I made a new friend. It's so much fun to make new friends, isn't it?\nClass: Yeah, Yes, etc.\nGirl 2: Did you tell you mom and dad about your new friend?\nRebecca: Absolutely! You should never keep anything from your parents. And I told them [gibberish]\nClass: [giggles]\nRebecca: Wh..\nClass [more giggles]\nRebecca: [gibberish]\nClass: [Laughs and giggles]\n[Rebecca goes to the board and starts writing]\nClass: C, A, T, H\nSidney: \"The.\"\nBoy: We know that word, \"the.\"\n[Rebecca collapses, on the board the words \"call the nurse\" are written]\n(Evil commercials...bane of my existence!)\n[House and Wilson are walking through the hallway. All you can see is their hands and legs, showing that House is using a cane and limping. Wilson is the only one of the two wearing a lab coat.]\nWilson: 29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.\nHouse: See that? They all assume I'm a patient because of this cane.\nWilson: So put on a white coat like the rest of us.\nHouse: I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.\nWilson: You see where the administration might have a problem with that attitude.\nHouse: People don't want a sick doctor.\nWilson: Fair enough. I don't like healthy patients. The 29 year old female...\nHouse: The one who can't talk, I liked that part.\nWilson: She's my cousin.\nHouse: And your cousin doesn't like the diagnosis. I wouldn't either. Brain tumor, she's gonna die, boring.\nWilson: No wonder you're such a renowned diagnostician. You don't need to actually know anything to figure out what's wrong.\nHouse: You're the oncologist; I'm just a lowly infectious disease guy.\nWilson: Hah, yes, just a simple country doctor. Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.\nHouse: She's 29. Whatever she's got is highly unlikely.\nWilson: Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.\nHouse: That's an HMO lab; you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.\nWilson: No family history.\nHouse: I thought your uncle died of cancer.\nWilson: Other side. No environmental factors.\nHouse: That you know of.\nWilson: And she's not responding to radiation treatment.\nHouse: None of which is even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?\nWilson: Come on! Why leave all the fun for the coroner? What's the point of putting together a team if you're not going to use them? You've got three overqualified doctors working for you. Getting bored.\n[Cut to Rebecca, into the nose, and up the blood stream. Cut to House looking through an MRI of Rebecca's head.]\nForeman: It's a lesion.\nHouse: And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island. I was hoping for something a bit more creative.\nForeman: Shouldn't we be speaking to the patient before we start diagnosing?\nHouse: Is she a doctor?\nForeman: No, but...\nHouse: Everybody lies.\nCameron: Dr. House doesn't like dealing with patients.\nForeman: Isn't treating patients why we became doctors?\nHouse: No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable.\nForeman: So you're trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine.\nHouse: If we don't talk to them they can't lie to us, and we can't lie to them. Humanity is overrated. I don't think it's a tumor.\nForeman: First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think \"horses\" not \"zebras\".\nHouse: Are you in first year of medical school? No. First of all, there's nothing on the CAT scan. Second of all, if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it never gets near this office. Differential diagnosis, people: if it's not a tumor what are the suspects? Why couldn't she talk?\nChase: Aneurysm, stroke, or some other ischemic syndrome.\nHouse: Get her a contrast MRI.\nCameron: Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.\nChase: Mad cow?\nHouse: Mad zebra.\nForeman: Wernickie's encephalopathy?\nHouse: No, blood thiamine level was normal.\nForeman: Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test. I assume it's a corollary if people lie, that people screw up.\nHouse: Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Let's find out what kind of zebra we're dealing with here.\n[Cut to House standing at the elevator, he sees Cuddy and presses the down button twice]\nCuddy: I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.\nHouse: Really? Well, that's odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago.\nCuddy: You think we have nothing to talk about?\nHouse: No, just that I can't think of anything that I'd be interested in.\nCuddy: I sign your paychecks.\nHouse: I have tenure. Are you going to grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?\nCuddy: That would be juvenile.\n[Both enter the elevator]\nCuddy: I can still fire you if you're not doing your job.\nHouse: I'm here from 9 to 5.\nCuddy: Your billings are practically nonexistent.\nHouse: Rough year.\nCuddy: You ignore requests for consults.\nHouse: I call back. Sometimes I misdial.\nCuddy: You're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.\nHouse: See, I was right, this doesn't interest me.\nCuddy: 6 years, times 3 weeks; you owe me better than 4 months.\nHouse: It's 5:00. I'm going home.\nCuddy: To what?\nHouse: Nice.\nCuddy: Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I don't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.\nHouse: Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren't going to fire me.\nCuddy: Your reputation won't last up if you don't do your job. The clinic is part of your job. I want you to do your job.\nHouse: Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, \"You can't always get what you want.\"\n[Scene of hospital from above, cut to hallway, Rebecca in wheelchair with Cameron, Chase, and Foreman around.]\nRebecca: You're not my doctor. Are you Dr. House?\nChase: Thankfully no. I'm Dr. Chase.\nCameron: Dr. House is the head of diagnostic medicine. He's very busy, but he has taken a keen interest in your case.\n[Cut to MRI room, Rebecca is on the table]\nForeman: We inject gadolinium into a vein. It distributes itself throughout your brain and acts as a contrast material for the magnetic resonance imagery.\nCameron: Basically, whatever's in your head, lights up like a Christmas tree.\nForeman: It might make you feel a little light-headed.\nNurse: Dr. Cameron. I'm sorry I have to stop you, there's a problem.\n[Cut to House, busting into Cuddy's office]\nHouse: You pulled my authorization.\nCuddy: Yes, why are you yelling?\nHouse: No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs.\nCuddy: You also can't make long distance phone calls.\nHouse: If you're gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.\nCuddy: Or photocopies; you're still yelling.\nHouse: I'm ANGRY! You're risking a patient's life.\nCuddy: I assume those are two separate points.\nHouse: You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as I'm still work here you have...[interrupted]\nCuddy: Is your yelling designed to scare me because I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be scared of. More yelling? That's not scary. That you're gonna hurt me? That's scary, but I'm pretty sure I can outrun ya.\nCuddy: Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted, Jagger, and you're right, \"You can't always get what you want,\" but as it turns out \"if you try sometimes you get what you need.\"\nHouse: So, because you want me to treat patients, you aren't letting me treat patients.\nCuddy: I need you to do your job.\n[House comes out of Cuddy's office; Wilson and the ducklings are there]\nHouse: Do the MRI, she folded. [Ducklings leave, House turns to Wilson] I've gotta do four hours a week in this clinic until I make up the time I've missed. 2054. I'll be caught up in 2054. [He walks into the clinic] You better love this cousin a whole lot.\n[Cut back to MRI room Rebecca is back on the table. She is pushed into the machine.]\nCameron: All right Rebecca, [over intercom] we know you may feel a little claustrophobic in there, but we need you to remain still.\nChase: [over intercom] Ok, we're gonna begin.\n[Machine starts up and makes weird sounds]\nRebecca: I don't feel so good.\nChase: It's all right. Just try to relax.\n[Rebecca starts choking. Cool shot of inside her throat. You can see that it closes up]\nCameron: Rebecca? [over intercom] Rebecca? [back in booth] Rebecca! Get her out of there.\nChase: Ah she probably fell asleep; she's exhausted.\nCameron: She was claustrophobic 30 seconds ago, she's not sleeping. We gotta get her out of there!\nChase: It'll just be another minute.\nCameron: She's having an allergic reaction to gadolinium. She'll be dead in two minutes.\nForeman: Hold her neck.\nCameron: Oh, she's ashen.\nForeman: She's not breathing. Epi point five.\nCameron: Come on, I can't ventilate.\nForeman: Too much edema, where's the surgical airway kit?\nChase: Yep, coming.\n[Cool cutting into Rebecca's neck sounds, and real colored blood for a change. They get her bagged.]\nChase: Good call.\n(And we're back to commercials...blah...)\n[Cut into hospital room, next day. Rebecca has a ventilator hooked up to her, and the ducklings are present]\nChase: We'll get that tube out of your throat later today.\nCameron: Just get some rest for now.\n[They leave to hallway, House is there.]\nHouse: Told you, can't trust people.\nCameron: She probably knew she was allergic to gadolinium, figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.\nHouse: Can't get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words.\nForeman: You actually want me to talk to the patient? Get a history?\nHouse: We need to know if there's some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.\nForeman: I thought everybody lied?\nHouse: Truth begins in lies. Think about it.\nForeman: That doesn't mean anything,does it?\n[House walks away]\n[House enters the clinic...dun dun dun!]\nHouse: 12:52 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes.\nCuddy: No TV, but we've got patients.\nHouse: Can't you give out the aspirin yourself? I'll do paperwork.\nCuddy: I made sure your first case was an interesting one.\nHouse: Cough just won't go away, runny nose looks a funny color.\nCuddy: Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.\nHouse: I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nCuddy: Patient is orange.\nHouse: The color?\nCuddy: No, the fruit.\nHouse: You mean yellow; it's jaundice.\nCuddy: I mean orange.\nHouse: Well, how orange?\nCuddy: Exam room 1.\n[Cut to House in exam room 1 with Orange Guy]\nOrange Guy: I was playing golf and my cleat got stuck. I mean, it hurt a little but I kept playing. The next morning I could barely stand up. Well, you're smiling so I take it that means this isn't serious.\n[House takes out his pills]\nOrange Guy: What's that? What are you doing?\nHouse: Painkillers.\nOrange Guy: Oh, for you, for your leg.\nHouse: No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better.\n[Guy nods and House gives him a painkiller]\nHouse: Unfortunately, you have a deeper problem. Your wife is having an affair.\nOrange Guy: What?!\nHouse: You're orange, you moron! It's one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she's just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?\n[Guy nods]\nHouse: The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good lawyer.\n[House leaves the room]\n[Cut to House in another exam room, this time with a little boy]\nHouse: Deep breath.\nLittle boy: It's cold.\nHouse: Has he been using his inhaler?\nMother: Not in the past few days. He's, um, only ten. I worry about children taking such strong medicine so frequently.\nLittle boy: What happened to your leg?\n[After saying this the little boy starts to wheeze a little, and continues throughout the entire time that House is talking.]\nHouse: Your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too. She probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing. Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years, don't you think? Ok, I'm gonna assume that no body's ever told you what asthma is, or if they have, you had other things on your mind. A stimulant triggers cells in your child's airways to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract. Mucus production increases, cell-lining starts to shed. But the steroids, the steroids...stop the inflammation. The more often this happens...[trails off and starts to leave the room]\nMother: What? \"The more often this happens...\"what?\"\nHouse: Forget it. If you don't trust steroids, you shouldn't trust doctors.\n[House leaves]\n[Cut to Rebecca's room]\nRebecca: My mother passed away three years ago. She had a heart attack, and my father broke his back doing construction.\n[Cameron's pager goes off]\nCameron: It's House, it's urgent. I'm sorry.\n[They go outside the room and see House waiting for them there]\nCameron: You couldn't have knocked?\nHouse: Steroids. Give her steroids, high doses of prednisone.\nForeman: You're looking for support for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitus.\nCameron: Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare. Especially for someone her age.\nHouse: So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.\nForeman: Mildly.\nCameron: That could mean anything, or nothing.\nHouse: Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it's vasculitus except that it could be.\nIf the blood vessels were inflamed that's gonna look exactly like what we saw on the MRI from Trenton County, and the pressure's gonna cause neurological symptoms.\nCameron: You can't diagnose that without a biopsy.\nHouse: Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that we're right.\nCameron: And if we're wrong?\nHouse: We learn something else.\n[Cut to overview of hospital, and then back into Rebecca's room]\nRebecca: Why steroids?\nChase: Just part of your treatment. You haven't had many visitors. No boyfriend?\nRebecca: Three dates. I wouldn't have stood by him if her were vomiting all day.\nChase: Well, what abut work? You must have friends from work.\nRebecca: Pretty much everybody I like is 5 years old. A nurse said you're stopping my radiation.\nChase: We're just trying some alternative medications. So, where's your family from then?\nRebecca: Steroids aren't an alternative to radiation.\nChase: The tests weren't really conclusive.\nCameron: We're treating you for vasculitus, it's the inflammation of blood vessels in the brain.\nRebecca: It's not a tumor? I don't have a tumor?\n[Cut to hallway with Cameron and Chase]\nChase: You should have told her the truth. It's a long shot guess.\nCameron: [to nurse] Thank you. [To Chase] If House is right, no harm, if he's wrong we've given a dying woman a couple days hope.\nChase: False hope.\nCameron: If there was any other type available I would have given her that.\n[Cut to classroom where Foreman is smelling the floor]\nSidney: Why are you smelling Billy's pants?\nForeman: I'm not.\nSidney: Looked like you were.\nForeman: I was smelling the floor.\nSidney: Oh.\nForeman: Do you have any pets in this class?\nSidney: No, but we used to have a gerbil, but Carly L. dropped a book on it.\nForeman: Careless.\nSidney: Do you need to smell it?\nForeman: No, I'm smelling for mold. I don't need to smell it.\nSidney: You can smell our parrot.\nForeman: You said you didn't have any pets in this class.\nSidney: A parrot is a bird.\n[Cut to House and Foreman eating lunch with some Soap on the TV that has House's attention more than Foreman does]\nForeman: Parrots are the primary source of psitticosis.\nHouse: It's not the parrot.\nForeman: Psitticosis can lead to nerve problems and neurological complications.\nHouse: How many kids were there in the class?\nForeman: 20.\nHouse: How many are home sick?\nForeman: None, but...\nHouse: None, but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher. You've been through her home?\nForeman: She lives in Trenton. I can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key.\nHouse: Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?\nForeman: It's not a crime scene.\nHouse: Far as I know she's running a Meth Lab out of her basement.\nForeman: She's a kindergarten teacher!\nHouse: And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly. [Sigh] Ok, I'll give you a for instance. The lady back there, who made your egg-salad sandwich. Her eyes look glassy, did you notice that? Now hospital policy is to stay home if you're sick, but if you're making $8.00 an hour, then ya kinda need the $8.00 an hour right? The sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities, but I figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve isn't hyper concerned about sanitary conditions. So what do ya think? Should I trust her? I want you to check the patient's home for contaminants, garbage, medication...[interrupted]\nForeman: Whoa, oh, I can't just break into someone's house.\nHouse: Isn't that how you got into the Felker's home? [pause] Yeah, I know, court records are sealed, you were 16, it was a stupid mistake, but your old gym teacher has a big mouth. You should write a thank you note.\nForeman: I should thank him?\nHouse: Well, I needed somebody around here with street smarts. Ok? Knows when you're being conned, knows how to con.\nForeman: I should sue you!\nHouse: I'm pretty sure you can't sue somebody for wrongful hiring.\nForeman: But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some lady's house.\n[Foreman eats the rest of the sandwich]\n[Cut to House sitting and reading \"Spring's hottest people' Magazine, Cuddy walks in]\nHouse: I'm doing research. People are fascinating aren't they?\nCuddy: Why are you giving Adler steroids?\nHouse: Well, she's my patient that's what you do with patients. You give them medicine.\nCuddy: You don't prescribe medicine based on guesses. At least we don't since Tuskeegee and Mengele.\nHouse: You're comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.\nCuddy: I'm stopping the treatment.\nHouse: She's my patient.\nCuddy: It's my hospital.\nHouse: I did not get her sick, she is not an experiment, I have a legitimate theory about what's wrong with her.\nCuddy: With no proof.\nHouse: There's never any proof. 5 different doctors come up with 5 different diagnoses based on the same evidence.\nCuddy: You don't have any evidence. And nobody knows anything huh? Then how is it that you always assume you're right?\nHouse: I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption. And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?\nCuddy: Because I'm a doctor. Because when we make mistakes people die.\n[She walks off up the stairs]\nHouse: Come on.\n[House thinks about going up the stairs, but decides against it]\nHouse: People used to have more respect for cripples you know! [Turns to a guy in a wheelchair] They didn't really.\n[Cut to Cuddy entering Rebecca's room. Rebecca is eating voraciously.]\nCuddy; So, how ya feeling?\nRebecca: Much better, thanks. Are you Dr. House? I thought he was a he, but...?\nCuddy: No. Don't eat too much too fast.\nRebecca: Thank him for me.\nCuddy: Right.\n[Cuddy exits the room, and House is standing there, Cuddy is a bit surprised by him standing there.]\nHouse: Should I discontinue the treatment, boss?\nCuddy: You got lucky.\n[She walks off]\nHouse: Cool, huh?\n[Cut to the outside of the hospital, and back into Rebecca's room, it's now night and Wilson is there]\nWilson: Ok, once again.\n[Rebecca takes a deep breath]\nWilson: Good.\nRebecca: Am I ever gonna meet Dr. House?\nWilson: [scoffs] Well, you might run into him at the movies or on the bus.\nRebecca: Is he a good man?\nWilson: He's a good doctor.\nRebecca: Can you be one without the other? Don't you have to care about people?\nWilson: Caring's a good motivator. He's found something else. [Has Rebecca grab his hands] Feel this?\nRebecca: umhmm\nWilson: How about this?\nRebecca: umhmm\nWilson: Ok squeeze. [Pause] Harder. All right.\nRebecca: He's your friend, huh?\nWilson: Yeah.\nRebecca: Does he care about you?\nWilson: I think so.\nRebecca: You don't know?\nWilson: As Dr. House likes to say, \"Everybody lies.\"\nRebecca: It's not what people say, it's what they do.\nWilson: [Pause] Yes, he cares about me.\nRebecca: I can't see. [Pause] I can't see.\n[She starts having a seizure and monitors go crazy]\nWilson: A little help in here!\n[Flat line on the heart monitor]\n(Commercial, again, evil!)\n[Cut back to Rebecca's room, daytime, she has an oxygen mask on. Foreman is there]\nForeman: Your chest will be sore for a while. We needed to shock you to get your heart going. Ok. [He lays a bunch of cards with pictures on them in front of Rebecca] Can you arrange these to tell a story?\n[cut to pictures and then to House's office]\nForeman: She couldn't put them in order.\nChase: Could the damage have been caused by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?\nForeman: No, I gave her the same test 5 minutes later and she did just fine. The altered mental status is intermittent, just like the verbal skills.\nCameron: So, what now?\nForeman: Given the latest symptoms it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem. Soon she won't be able to walk, she'll go blind permanently, and then the respiratory center will fail.\nHouse: How long do we have?\nForeman: If it's a tumor we're talking a month, maybe two, if it's infectious a few weeks, if it's vascular that'll probably be fastest of all, maybe a week.\nHouse: We're gonna stop all treatment.\n[House gets up and walks over to the drinks.]\nForeman: I still think it's a tumor. I think we should go back to the radiation.\nChase: She didn't respond to the radiation.\nForeman: Well, maybe we didn't see the effects until we started steroids.\nHouse: No, it's not a tumor. The steroids did something, I just don't know what.\nForeman: So we're just gonna do nothing? We're just gonna watch her die?\nHouse: Yeah, we're gonna watch her die. Specifically we're gonna watch how fast she's dying. You just told us, each diagnosis has its own timeframe. When we see how fast it's killing her we'll know what it is.\nCameron: And by then maybe there's nothing we can do about it.\nForeman: There's go to be something we can do, something better than watching her die.\nHouse: Well, I got nothing. How 'bout you?\n[Cut to hallway, Foreman and Cameron exit the office]\nForeman: b*st*rd. [Turns to Cameron] Oh, Cameron, I need you for a couple of hours.\nCameron: What's up?\nForeman: When you break into someone's house; it's always better to have a white chick with you.\nCameron: Adler's house? Why don't we just ask her for a key?\nForeman: For all we know she could be running a meth lab out of her basement.\n[Cut to clinic and House is with a patient, a guy]\nGuy: I'm tired a lot.\nHouse: Any other reason you think you may have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?\nGuy: It's kinda the definition isn't it?\nHouse: It's kinda the definition of getting older.\nGuy: I had a couple headaches last month, mild fever, sometimes I can't sleep, and I have trouble concentrating.\nHouse: Apparently not while researching this stuff on the internet.\nGuy: I was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia.\nHouse: [Looks contemplative, and then serious] Excellent diagnosis [sarcastic]!\nGuy: Is there anything for that?\nHouse: [heavy sigh] Ya know, I think there just might be.\n[House goes out of the room, and to the dispensary.]\nHouse: I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar.\nNurse: (jumbled, I can't tell)\n[House gets his change and goes to a candy machine. He gets white candies out of the machine, and goes back to the counter. There he takes the Vicodin and slips them into his pocket, exchanging them for the candy.]\nHouse: Exam room 2. [Places the bottle back on the counter.]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Cut to Cameron and Foreman in Rebecca's house]\nCameron: House doesn't believe in pretense. Figures life's too short and too painful. So he just says what he thinks.\nForeman: Nothing interesting in the garbage. \"I say what I think\" is just another way of saying \"I'm an ass.\"\nCameron: Well, if you wanted to be judged on your medical prowess only, maybe you shouldn't have broken into someone's home.\nForeman: I was 16! Don't know about ticks, but her dog's definitely got fleas.\nCameron: I managed to make it to 17 without a criminal record.\n[Foreman is in the fridge, and takes out some ham and mustard]\nForeman: Yeah? Well you obviously didn't grow up in my neighborhood.\nCameron: That's right. You stole a loaf of bread to feed your starving family right? You always eat during break-ins?\nForeman: Am I supposed to respect their food more than I respect their DVD players? You want some?\nCameron: No.\nForeman: You gonna go hungry until she dies?\nCameron: No.\nForeman: You know what, after centuries of oppression, decades of civil rights marches, and more significantly living like a monk, never getting less than a 4.0 GPA, you don't think it's kind of disgusting I get one of the top jobs in the country because I'm a delinquent? We'll eat, then we'll tear up the carpet.\nCameron: You went to Hopkins right?\nForeman: Yep.\nCameron: So, you went to a better school than I did, got better grades than I did.\nForeman: So how'd you get the job? Did you stab a guy in a bar fight?\n[Off Cameron's face, a little disturbed]\n[Cut to the hospital exterior, daytime, then into House's office again]\nForeman: Nothing.\nHouse: It's not a tumor; she's getting worse too fast. She can't stand up.\nWilson: No toxins, no medication?\nForeman: Nothing that would explain these symptoms.\nWilson: Family history of neurological problems?\nForeman: Not that I could tell from her underwear drawer.\nHouse: You said nothing that would explain these symptoms. What did you find that doesn't explain these symptoms?\nForeman: Dr. Wilson convinced you to treat this patient under false pretenses. Adler's not his cousin.\nWilson: That's ridiculous. You can ask her yourself. Can we get back to... [interrupted]\nForeman: She's not Jewish!\nWilson: Rachel Adler's not Jewish?\nForeman: I had ham at her apartment!\nWilson: [chuckles] Dr. Foreman, a lot of Jews have non-Jewish relatives, and most of us don't keep kosher. I can see getting through high school without learning a thing about Jews, but medical school...\nForeman: Ok, maybe she's Jewish, but she's definitely not your cousin.\nWilson: Really? This guy's...he...\nForeman: You don't even know her name! You called her Rachel; her name is Rebecca!\nWilson: Yes, yes, her name is Rebecca. I call her Rachel.\n[While this is going on House is very quiet and you can almost see that he is putting things together}\nHouse: You idiot!\nWilson: Hey...listen...\nHouse: Not you, him! You said you didn't find anything.\nForeman: Everything I found was in [interrupted]\nHouse: You found ham.\nForeman: So?\nHouse: Where there's ham there's pork, where there's pork there's neurocysticercosis.\nChase: Tapeworm?! You think she's got a worm in her brain?\nHouse: It fits. Could have been living there for years, it never occurred to me [interrupted]\nCameron: Millions of people eat ham every day. It's quite a leap to think that she's got a tapeworm.\nHouse: OK, Mr. Neurologist. What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?\nForeman: They, they get a little better and then they get worse.\nWilson: Just like Rebecca Adler did.\n[Cut out and then in again, House has a book and lays it on the table, open to a page on tapeworms]\nHouse: In a typical case if you don't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae. They got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel, they live, they grow up, they reproduce.\nChase: Reproduce? There's only got one lesion, and it's nowhere near her bowel.\nHouse: That's because this is not a typical case. Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day. Guess where they go.\nForeman: Out.\nHouse: Not all of them. Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines and into the blood stream. And where does the blood stream go?\nCameron: Everywhere.\nHouse: As long as it's healthy the immune system doesn't even know it's there. The worm builds a wall, uses secretions to shut down the body's immune response and control fluid flow. It's really kinda beautiful.\nForeman: As long as it's healthy, so what do we do? Call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health?\nHouse: It's too late for that. It's dying, and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control of the host's defenses. The immune system wakes up and attacks the worm and everything starts to swell, and that is very bad for the brain.\nWilson: It could still be a hundred other things. The eosinophil count was normal.\nChase: It's only abnormal in 30% of cases.\nWilson: Proving nothing.\nHouse: No, no, no, no, you see, it fits, it's perfect! It explains everything.\nWilson: But it proves nothing.\nHouse: I can prove it by treating it.\nWilson: No, you can't. I was just with her, she doesn't want any more treatments, she doesn't want any more experiments, she wants to go home and die.\n(Commercials! Gah! I wish commercials would go home and die!)\n[Cut back into Rebecca's room, it's nighttime and House enters]\nHouse: [To nurse] Will you excuse us, please?\n[Nurse leaves]\nHouse: I'm Dr. House.\nRebecca: It's good to meet you.\nHouse: You're being an idiot. Ahem. [Pause] You have a tapeworm in your brain, it's not pleasant, but if we don't do anything you'll be dead by the weekend.\nRebecca: Have you actually seen the worm?\nHouse: When you're all better I'll show you my diplomas.\nRebecca: You were sure I had vasculitus too. Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a\ndiaper. What's this treatment gonna do for me?\nHouse: I'm not talking about a treatment; I'm talking about a cure. But because I might be wrong, you want to die.\nRebecca: What made you a cripple?\nHouse: I had an infarction.\nRebecca: A heart attack?\nHouse: It's what happens when the blood flow is obstructed. If it's in the heart it's a heart attack. If it's in the lungs it's a pulmonary embolism. If it's in the brain it's a stroke. I had it in my thigh muscles.\nRebecca: Wasn't there something they could do?\nHouse: There was plenty they could do, if they made the right diagnosis, but the only symptom was pain. Not may people get to experience muscle death.\nRebecca: Did you think you were dying?\nHouse: I hoped I was dying.\nRebecca: So you hide in your office, refuse to see patients because you don't like the way people look at you. You feel cheated by life so now you're gonna get even with the world. You want me to fight this. Why? What makes you think I'm so much better than you?\nHouse: When you're scared, you'll turn into me.\nRebecca: I just want to die with a little dignity.\nHouse: There's no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're even born, but it always happens and there's never any dignity in it. I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It's always ugly, always. [Pause] You can live with dignity, we can't die with it.\n[Cut to hallway, outside the room, looks like daytime, but it could be the lights in the hospital.]\nHouse: No treatment.\nForeman: Maybe we can get a court order, override her wishes. Claim she doesn't have the capacity to make this decision.\nHouse: But she does.\nCameron: But we could claim that the illness made her mentally incompetent.\nForeman: Pretty common result.\nHouse: That didn't happen here.\nWilson: He's not gonna do it. She's not just a file to him anymore. He respects her.\nCameron: So because you respect her, you're going to let her die?\nHouse: I solved the case, my work is done.\n[House starts to walk away]\nHouse: Patients always want proof, we're not making cars here, we don't give guarantees.\n[House continues walking, Off Chase]\nChase: I think we can prove it's a worm. It's noninvasive, it's safe. I'm not completely sure but...[interrupted]\nHouse: Yeah, yeah, yeah what's the damn idea?\nChase: Have you ever seen a worm under an x-ray, a regular old no contrast 100-year-old technology x-ray? They light up like shotgun pellets. Just like on a contrast MRI.\nForeman: Which is the same thing as a CT scan, which we did, which proved nothing.\nHouse: Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid, we're not going to see anything in her head, but Chase is right, he's right, we should x-ray her, but we don't x-ray her brain, we x-ray her leg, worms love thigh muscle. If she's got one in her head I guarantee you there's one in her leg.\n[Cut to x-ray table, Rebecca is on it, and they focus on her leg, x-ray is taken.]\nChase: Hold still, Rebecca.\n[...And the worm shows up. Cut to Rebecca's hospital room, day.]\nChase: This here is a worm larva. [Chase pointing to x-ray of her leg]\nRebecca: So, if it's in my leg, it's in my brain?\nChase: Are you looking for a guarantee? It's there, probably been there 6 to 10 years.\nRebecca: Could I have more?\nChase: Probably. It's good news.\nRebecca: What do we do now?\nChase: Now we get you better. Albendazole.\n[Hands her a cup with two pills in it.]\nRebecca: Two pills?\nChase: Yeah, every day for at least a month with a meal.\nRebecca: Two pills?\nChase: Yeah, possible side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, dizziness, fever, and hair loss. We'll probably make you keep taking the pills even if you get every one of those.\n[Rebecca smirks, and then downs the pills]\n[Cut to House's office, day. Cameron's there waiting as House enters.]\nCameron: Why did you hire me?\nHouse: Does it matter?\nCameron: Kinda hard to work for a guy who doesn't respect you.\nHouse: Why?\nCameron: Is that rhetorical?\nHouse: No, it just seems that way because you can't think of an answer. Does it make a difference why I think I'm a jerk? The only thing that matters is what you think. Can you do the job?\nCameron: You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.\nHouse: No, it wasn't a racial thing, I didn't see a black guy. I just saw a doctor...with a juvenile record. I hired Chase 'cause his dad made a phone call. I hired you because you are extremely pretty.\nCameron: You hired me to get into my pants?!\nHouse: I can't believe that that would shock you. It's also not what I said. No, I hired you because you look good; it's like having a nice piece of art in the lobby.\nCameron: I was in the top of my class.\nHouse: But not THE top.\nCameron: I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.\nHouse: Yes, you were a very good applicant.\nCameron: But not the best?\nHouse: Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence?\nCameron: I worked very hard to get where I am.\nHouse: But you didn't have to. People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That's a law of nature, and you defied it. That's why I hired you. You could have married rich, could have been a model, you could have just shown up and people would have given you stuff. Lots of stuff, but you didn't, you worked your stunning little ass off.\nCameron: Am I supposed to be flattered?\nHouse: Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?\nCameron: No!\nHouse: Sexually assaulted?\nCameron: No.\nHouse: But you are damaged, aren't you?\n[Cameron hesitates, and in that moment her pager goes off]\nCameron: I have to go.\n[She leaves, cut to orange guy (not so orange now) in with Cuddy]\nOrange guy: I followed her. I couldn't stop thinking about what that doctor said.\nCuddy: I told you not to listen to him, he's an idiot.\nOrange guy: I was ORANGE.\nCuddy: I don't want to know what you found out.\nOrange guy: You don't care?\nCuddy: I'm your doctor, you've been good to me and good to this hospital, of course I care, but I don't see how this conversation can end well for me. Either your wife is having an affair, or she's not having an affair and you have come here because you rightly think I should fire him, but I can't even if it cost me your money, the son of a bitch is the best doctor we have.\n[Cut to his finger, now missing his ring]\n[Cut to Rebecca's room, Chase enters]\nChase: Feeling any better?\nRebecca: I can't complain.\nChase: As you know the hospital has certain rules, and as you also know we tend to ignore them, but I think this one's gonna be a little obvious unless we get your help.\n[Cameron enters with Rebecca's class]\nCameron: If anyone asks, you have 11 daughters and 5 sons.\nRebecca: Hi, you guys!\nClass: Hi!\nRebecca: Come here!\n[They gather around her bed and present her with a card.]\nRebecca: It's so good to see you guys! I missed you! Is this for me?\n[Rebecca opens it and inside it says \"Miss Rebecca we're glad you're not dead\"]\nRebecca: Oh, I love you guys. [To Chase and Cameron] I wanted to thank Dr. House, but he never visited again.\nCameron: He cured you, you didn't cure him.\nRebecca: [Talking to class] Ok, I want a hug and a kiss from every single one of you. Get up here right now!\nClass: [Giggles, and laughs]\n[They get up on the bed with Rebecca]\n[Cut to House watching General Hospital (I assume)]\nFemale Dr. on mini TV: There.\nMale Dr on mini TV: Hold on.\nFemale Dr. on mini TV: She's converted.\nHouse: You said she was your cousin. Why would you lie?\nWilson: It got you to take the case.\nHouse: You lied to a friend to save a stranger, you don't think that's screwed up?\nWilson: You've never lied to me?\nHouse: I NEVER lie.\nWilson: Oh, really.\nMale Dr on mini TV: Why do we do this?\nFemale Dr. on mini TV: Because we're doctors, when we make mistakes people die.\n[House gets a great little smirk here, re: Cuddy using the same line earlier]\n[Knock on the door]\nNurse: Dr. House? You have a patient.\n[Nurse pulls the blinds away to reveal the guy that House gave the candy pills to.]\nNurse: He says he needs a refill.\nHouse: Got change for a dollar?\n[Cut to outside the hospital and aerial view of the campus.]\nSinging: \"No, you can't always get what you want.\" \"You can't always get what you want.\"", "source": "tv_show_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"instructions": ["Write a summary for the scene."], "outputs": ["Frasier has a recurring erotic dream in which he wakes up in bed, hears the shower running and is shocked when the person who emerges is KACL's food critic, Gil Chesterton. He struggles to work out the meaning of the dream, eventually concluding that his show did not provide him with the challenge he needed, so his subconscious provided a problem for him to work out. Once he realizes that it what has been happening, he dreams that Sigmund Freud comes to his hotel room, and climbs into bed with him. The episode ends with waking up after this nightmare."], "input": "Act One\nScene One - A Seedy Motel Room. Frasier is lying in bed, asleep, in the motel room. He awakens and finds that he has a tattoo on his arm that reads \"Chesty.\" There is a half-empty bottle of tequila on a table across from the bed. A shower is running, but then stops suddenly. Frasier props himself up on some pillows and folds him arms behind his head, expectantly.\nOut from the bathroom steps Gil Chesterton - wearing only a towel.\nGil: Well, look who's up!\nSMASH CUT TO: Frasier sits up in bed - his own bed. The previous scene had been a dream - or a nightmare, considering Frasier's panic-stricken reaction.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nWHY GIL? WHY NOW?\nScene Two - KACL. Frasier is listening to a young male caller, Jimmy.\nJimmy: [v.o.] So it's my parents. I don't know, they're just like, really stupid.\nFrasier: [bored] May I ask how old you are?\nJimmy: Fourteen.\nFrasier: Well, hang on, Jimmy. Your parents are going to be stupid for another seven years.\nJimmy: Whoa! Seven years? That's like, longer than I'll be in high school!\nFrasier: I salute your optimism. [disconnects] We'll be right back after this.\nHe goes off air as Roz enters his booth.\nFrasier: Oh god, Roz. A teenager who's embarrassed by his parents? I mean, please. Can't you come up with something a little more challenging for me?\nRoz: Well, it was either him or our old pal, Rudy the Crier.\nFrasier: Oh, Rudy the Crier. Oh God. He's been on three times in the last month. You put him on again, he won't be the only one who's crying. God, I'm in a dry spell. Where are the souls in genuine torment? The people teetering on the brink of genuine despair?\nRoz: Oh, they'll be back. The holidays are just around the corner.\nFrasier: Well, perhaps you're right. Oh, Roz, I've got a question I'd like to ask you.\nRoz: Shoot.\nFrasier: Have you ever had a recurring dream of an intimate nature about someone... oh, a... well, a co-worker?\nRoz: [disgusted] Oh, no. Why'd you tell me?\nFrasier: Oh, Roz!\nRoz: Oh, now it's gonna be creepy everytime you look at me through the glass!\nFrasier: Roz, not you!\nRoz: [intrigued] So who is it then?\nFrasier: Oh, I'm not going to go into the specifics.\nRoz: Gina in accounting?\nFrasier: Look, I'm not gonna do this!\nRoz: Sheila, the slow intern?\nFrasier: Forget I even mentioned it.\nGil enters. He's hiding something behind his back.\nGil: Knock knock...\nFrasier: [suddenly nervous] Gil? [Roz eyes Frasier suspiciously]\nGil: Frasier, I've come to tempt you.\nFrasier: [scared] Really?\nGil: I'm reviewing the new pastry chef at Chez Shea. [reveals an\neclair] And I quote: \"His amaretto eclair is so sinful, it will send you scurrying to your local padre for absolution.\"\nFrasier: Uh... no, thank you, Gil. I'm on a diet.\nGil: Oh, come now! You know you want it...\nFrasier: [jumping up] Oh, no no no... I really don't! [shoos Gil out the door] Off you go. Bye-bye.\nRoz: [excited] Oh, my god!\nFrasier: What?\nRoz: It was Gil!\nFrasier: I never said that!\nRoz: Then why are you blushing?\nFrasier: Oh, don't be ridiculous!\nRoz: Your ears are turning bright red!\nFrasier: I am not blushing!\nRoz: You are!\nGil then knocks on one of the windows. As they look at him he takes a big bite out of the eclair. Frasier hurriedly closes the blinds as Roz laughs.\nFrasier: Still not blushing! The scene DISSOLVES to another caller - Rudy the Crier.\nRudy: [v.o.] ...just lying there in the hospital bed. She lifted her head off the pillow, looked up and said, \"I love you,\" and then she was gone. [cries]\nFrasier: Rudy, stop crying. We've gone over this before. What was our agreement about sad movies?\nRudy: I shouldn't watch them. [cries]\nFrasier: Exactly. Now go get a cool washcloth and try to bring down the puffiness around your eyes. Please... stay away from sad or depressing things... which, at this moment, includes listening to the Dr. Frasier Crane Show. [disconnects] Well, let's shoot it to the news. That's it for today. This is Dr. Frasier Crane. [he goes off air and Roz enters] Oh, my God! Well, close the record books. That was just the dullest three hours in the history of the Frasier Crane Show!\nRoz: Oh, come on. It wasn't so bad. What about that woman who was so concerned about her appearance she wouldn't leave the house?\nFrasier: That was a commercial! I believe Miss Clairol solved the problem! Well, I'll see you tomorrow. [he moves to exit, then turns back] Oh! Oh, Roz... about that dream I mentioned to you earlier... uh... this goes without saying, but I'd rather you didn't share that with anyone else.\nRoz: Oh, sure.\nBetty: [passing by] Hi, dreamboy!\nFrasier: [to Roz] I hate you! Couldn't keep your big mouth shut, could you? Just exactly when did you find the time to spread the news?\nRoz: You don't think I was listening to your show, do you?\nBulldog enters.\nBulldog: Comin' through! Oh, Doc... I got to rub this one in a little...\nFrasier: All right, look, Bulldog... before you start to ridicule me, yes, yes I had a dream about Gil. And yes, it had some erotic elements, but... [notices Bulldog's surprised expression] You have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, do you?\nBulldog: I do now! Whoa! [laughs]\nFrasier: Look, let's just forget it. What delightful little jibe did you have prepared for me?\nBulldog: Oh, I was gonna tell you your show today just broke the snooze meter, but now I want to hear about you greasin' Gil's cookie sheet! [honks horn]\nFrasier: I'm on a bus to Hell.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nPSYCHIATRIST...CRANE...\nFRASIER...NILES...IDIOTS\nScene Three - Cafe Nervosa. Frasier and Niles are standing at the counter. Niles is relaying a story to a bored Frasier.\nNiles: So I returned to the dry-cleaners yet a third time. I hardly need to tell you how the story ends.\nFrasier: Just tell me when the story ends.\nNiles: [miffed] Fine. They realigned my pleats, The End.\nFrasier: Sorry, Niles. [they get their coffees and sit at a nearby table] I'm just a bit distracted today. You see, this morning, a... a man from my building approached me with a very intriguing problem. It seems he's been having a recurring dream.\nNiles: Oh, please. That little gambit didn't work when we were in knee socks. What was your dream, Frasier?\nFrasier: Oh, all right! It's been tormenting me. I haven't been able to sleep in weeks now. It's a bit hazy but... it starts out in a seedy motel room. I'm naked.\nNiles: Interesting.\nFrasier: Yes, well... I roll over and discover on my forearm a tattoo: the word \"Chesty.\"\nNiles: Interesting.\nFrasier: Then the shower turns off and out from the bathroom steps... a man. [pause] All right, go ahead, let me have it!\nNiles: Are you saying that now, or is that a quote from the dream?\nFrasier: [annoyed] Please? We're both too intelligent to waste time on the obvious interpretation.\nNiles: Yes. But you must admit, it's rather intriguing. [chuckles]\nFrasier: Would you stop? It's obviously screaming for a Jungian interpretation. The sexuality in the dream is surely symbolic of some deeper, non-sexual conflict.\nNiles: All right.\nGil approaches the table with a smug grin on his face.\nGil: Good afternoon, Frasier.\nFrasier: Gil.\nGil: A little birdie tells me I was featured in your midnight movie.\nFrasier: That's very clever. Off you go.\nGil: Very well. I'll see you tomorrow. Or should I say, \"See you in your dreams\"? [exits]\nNiles: In this dream of yours, were there any cigars, bananas or short, blunt swords?\nFrasier: Would you stop it?! I'm 43 - a little late for latency.\nRebecca, the waitress, comes over.\nRebecca: You guys okay over here?\nNiles: Oh, we're fine.\nFrasier: [flirting] Well... you must be new here. I surely would have remembered such a pretty face as yours.\nNiles: You're overcompensating.\nFrasier: Right. We're fine. Bye-bye. [she leaves] I'm just baffled, Niles. Obviously, Gil Chesterton explains \"Chesty\" but little else.\nNiles: Perhaps you should tackle this from a free-association standpoint.\nFrasier: God, must we?\nNiles: Well, now... focus on any detail in the motel room. What's the first thing that pops into your mind?\nFrasier: Uh... a crescent-shaped lamp.\nNiles: Perfect - crescent-shaped lamp. Run with that. Crescent... moon... Daphne Moon... French maid... brass bed... satin robe...\nFrasier: Niles! This is my dream!\nNiles: I was just showing you the process.\nFrasier: You were three words away from a cigarette!\nNiles: [outraged] Your turn!\nFrasier: All right.\nNiles: Crescent lamp.\nFrasier: Crescent... croissant... butter... apricot jam... hunger... food... diet! My God, I've been on a diet. Do you think that's useful?\nNiles: You could stand to lose a few pounds.\nFrasier: Just wait a minute. Gil is a restaraunt critic - a gourmet. Perhaps he's symbolic of the food I've been denying myself.\nNiles: That would explain why you're naked in the dream. It's when we're naked that we're most self-conscious about our bodies.\nFrasier: Yes, and most vulnerable to the way society \"tattoos\" us with labels about our appearance! God, that's it, Niles! The dream is simply telling me that I've been too rigid about my diet!\nNiles: Well, you'll know tonight. If this is the correct interpretation, the conflict will have passed from your unconscious to your conscious mind.\nFrasier: Yes, the dream will have served its purpose.\nNiles: And you will no longer be plagued by it.\nFrasier: Oh, God, Niles. I've nailed it all right. I really have. Finally, for the first time in weeks they'll be no tequila bottles, no tattoo, no half-naked man in my bed. [he looks up to see Rebecca standing at their table] So then, the Rabbi says...\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene Four - The Motel Room. Once again, Frasier is in bed. The tequila bottle is still there, and he still has the tattoo. The shower turns off and out from the bathroom steps a rather buxom woman wearing only a towel. Frasier looks pleasantly surprised.\nWoman: Oh, I'm sorry... wrong room. [leaves]\nFrasier's expression turns to disappointment. Gil suddenly appears lying next to Frasier in bed.\nGil: That does it. We're finding another motel.\nSMASH CUT TO: Frasier again wakes up from his dream in a panic. He notices something under the covers next to him. He cautiously pulls back the covers to reveal Eddie. He isn't any more pleased about this.\nEnd of Act One. Act Two.\nScene One - The elevator at the Elliot Bay Towers. Daphne and Martin are in the back of the elevator. The doors open and a woman gets on, standing in front of Daphne and Martin. Daphne says hello and they lapse into silence for a moment. She and Martin then begin to speak to each other in a conspiratorial tone.\nDaphne: Someone followed me again last night.\nMartin: Ah, you're just being paranoid.\nDaphne: I'm telling you, they're onto me.\nMartin: Come on. Nobody could recognize you after all that plastic surgery.\nThe woman becomes alarmed at this.\nDaphne: That's what Marlena thought.\nMartin: Marlena got sloppy. She never should have gone back to Zurich.\nDaphne: I just don't want any more bloodshed.\nMartin: Relax. You're home free.\nDaphne: You don't know the Woodchuck and his ways.\nThe doors open and the woman rushes out in fear. Martin and Daphne break down laughing.\nDaphne: Oh, we're terrible!\nMartin: We are? You are! \"The Woodchuck and his ways\"?\nDaphne: You know, we really should stop doing this. It's not nice.\nMartin: Ah, you're right. We won't do it anymore.\nThe doors open and a man enters.\nDaphne: [as soon as the doors close, to Martin] How'd you get the stuff through Customs?\nMartin: They never check the wooden leg.\nCUT TO: Frasier's apartment. Frasier is pacing the living room as Niles sits at the couch, poring over psychology textbooks.\nFrasier: The answer has got to be in there somewhere!\nNiles: Here's something. [reads] \"Dreams as an expression of wish fulfillment.\"\nFrasier: [grabs the book] Moving on.\nDaphne and Martin enter.\nDaphne: Goodness, are you two still here?\nMartin: What are you working on?\nFrasier: Nothing.\nNiles: I'm helping Frasier interpret a dream he's been having. You know, maybe Dad can help.\nFrasier: [alarmed] No, no, no... don't want to bore Dad with the details of this particular dream.\nNiles: Dreams can be rooted in childhood experience. Maybe Dad remembers something you've repressed.\nMartin: Gee, I don't know. If it's about when you were a kid I've repressed a lot of that myself. [exits to the kitchen]\nFrasier: Niles, this is not a dream I wish to share with Dad, thank you very much.\nNiles: Well, we've exhausted every other interpretation. So, I guess it's back to dreams as wish fulfillment...\nFrasier: Oh, Dad... [he moves to the kitchen where Martin is making a sandwich] Would you mind listening to my dream to see if it conjures up any memories from my childhood?\nMartin: Oh, come on. You're making too much out of this. It's a dream. Dreams are weird.\nFrasier: Please, Dad. I wouldn't ask if it weren't really bothering me.\nMartin: Well, all right... go on.\nFrasier: All right... it starts out in a little motel room. I have a tattoo on my arm - \"Chesty\"...\nMartin: See? That's weird.\nFrasier: Yes. Then out from the bathroom steps a... All right, now before I continue, let me remind you that this is a dream. Not to be confused with reality. [Martin nods, still busy with his sandwich] Out from the bathroom steps a man... [off Martin's concerned expression] -eating lion!\nMartin: [relieved] Oh, see? There again, weird. Look, dreams come, they go. They don't mean anything. Except, you know, if you're lucky, every once in awhile you might have one that's a lot of fun. Like, you hit a home run in the World Series or you're in the jungle with Jayne Mansfield and she gets bit by a snake.\nFrasier: Thank you, Dad.\nMartin: You know who Jayne Mansfield is, don't you?\nFrasier: Yes, Dad.\nMartin: You know what you do when you're bit by a snake, don't you?\nFrasier: Yes, Dad. [leaves]\nMartin: [to himself] Wish I knew what I had for dinner that night.\nFrasier enters the living room to find Niles and Daphne on the couch, chatting about Frasier's dream.\nDaphne: Oh, I get it. Chesty refers to Gil Chesterton.\nFrasier: Niles, you gossipy fishwife!\nDaphne: [standing] There's no reason to feel self-conscious, Dr. Crane. We've all had dreams like that. I had one about a girl I shared a flat with once - a gymnast.\nNiles: [standing] Go on, Daphne. This could be significant.\nDaphne: Well, I remember we were doing stretches in the gymnasium, when suddenly we decided to take off all our clothes and go for a bounce on the trampoline. [giggles] The next thing you know, I'm chasing her around the pommel horse. Oh, never mind...\nNiles: [aroused] Don't stop now! [off their looks] This could help us. [sits]\nDaphne: Well, actually, I do have a theory of my own about your dream, if you'd like to hear it.\nFrasier: What the hell.\nDaphne: Well... in your dream, who was in the shower? Gil. What is a shower? Running water. Who needs water? Fish. What do fish have? Gills! Do you see where I'm going?\nFrasier: Insane?\nDaphne: It could be a dream about the loss of a beloved childhood pet.\nMartin: [entering from the kitchen with Eddie] Thanks a lot, Eddie. Forty-five minutes in the park, you don't have to go. I get one bite into my sandwich and you give me the look.\nDaphne: Mr. Crane, did Dr. Crane ever have a goldfish growing up?\nMartin: A fish?\nDaphne: Yes, as a pet.\nMartin: How would I know? That was Hester's department. [to Eddie] Come on, let's go. [leaves]\nNiles: Frasier, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\nFrasier: That Dad can interpret the looks from his dog and has only the spottiest recollections of our childhoods?\nNiles: No. No, no, no. Hester - Hesty. The tattoo - that's only one letter away from Chesty!\nFrasier: Niles, are you saying that the dream could have been about mother?\nNiles: Well?\nFrasier: I suppose I could have misread the tattoo. [rolls up his shirt sleeve] Yes, yes... this freckle pattern here on my arm could be mistaken for a \"C.\"\nDaphne: And what swims in the sea? Fish! [off their looks] All right, all right I'll go. [exits to her room]\nNiles: Well, so the tattoo could have said \"Hesty.\" But the problem is, I don't ever remember Dad calling her that.\nFrasier: But who's to say he didn't?\nThey both gasp and run to the elevator, where Martin is still waiting with Eddie.\nBoth: Dad, Dad... Dad, Dad!\nMartin: What?\nFrasier: Did you ever have a nickname for Mother?\nMartin: Oh, for God's sakes! Is this to do with that stupid dream?\nFrasier: Dad, this is really important!\nNiles: Any pet name? A term of endearment?\nMartin: Well... when we were first married I used to call her \"Honey.\" And then... there was a time after that that I started calling her \"Sweetie.\"\nFrasier: I'm sure there's a delicious anecdote behind each one of those. But did you ever call her \"Hesty\"?\nMartin: \"Hesty\"?\nFrasier: [forcefully] Oh, come on, think, man! Even once! Once, in all the years you lived together?!\nMartin: [nervously] We-Well... I don't know. [elevator doors open] I- I guess...\nFrasier: Really?\nMartin: Yeah, maybe once... [stumbles into the elevator, disturbed]\nFrasier: Oh, thank you Dad! [doors close] Well, there it is! I must have heard him call her \"Hesty\" once and neatly tucked it away into my subconscious.\nNiles: Of course, it's so obvious! Gil is a food critic. Food, criticism...\nBoth: Mother!\nNiles: It's the classic Oedipal dream!\nFrasier: Yes, yes... only I was so frightened by my sexual urges to be with my mother that I transformed her into a man! Oh, what a relief! I've been wringing my hands over nothing. I mean, it's okay. All I want to do is have s*x with my dead mother!\nFrasier turns to see that a woman has been standing by the elevator doors and has overheard him. He sheepishly enters his apartment.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene Six - the Motel Room. The scene reveals a painting of bananas and swords above the bed where Frasier is sleeping. He awakens to find the tattoo of \"Chesty\" still on his arm and the sound of the shower running. He is exasperated. The shower stops and he turns to the bathroom door with a look of apprehension.\nFrasier: Mom? Mommy?\nGil: [entering] Patience, Daddy!\nSMASH CUT TO: Frasier again wakes up from his dream in a panic and switches on the light in his bedroom.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTHANK GOD HE WAS WRONG\nABOUT THAT \"MOTHER\" THING\nScene Two - Frasier's apartment. The middle of the night. Frasier is poring over textbooks at the kitchen table. Martin enters from his bedroom, groaning.\nMartin: You'd think by now I'd know better than to have that third Slim Jim before going to bed. Couldn't sleep either, huh?\nFrasier: No. Frankly, I'm sort of afraid to go back to sleep. It's that damn dream again.\nMartin: Oh, what are you worried about? It's just a dream. Worst case scenario - the man-eating lion leaps on top of you and mauls you.\nFrasier: I'm sorry, Dad, I wasn't completely truthful with you before. The dream is really about me in a motel room with a male companion, Gil Chesterton.\nMartin: You don't care if I ever sleep again, do you?\nHe absentmindedly turns on the TV. Frasier turns it off behind him.\nFrasier: Dad, please, I'd really like to discuss this!\nMartin: No, Frasier, please. This makes me very uncomfortable.\n[he enters the kitchen with Frasier following him]\nFrasier: Dad, please...\nMartin: I know, I know... in your generation, men talk about everything. Everything's out in the open. [he begins to nervously clean the refrigerator and countertop, avoiding eye contact] You know what really drives me crazy is the way you all touch each other. Everybody hugs, you know? In my generation it was a... a handshake. That was good enough. Maybe if you felt especially close to someone you'd touch him on the shoulder, but never for more than two seconds. And don't talk to me about football players patting people's butts and everything, because that's different - that's sports, that's like war. Now, goodnight, son. [exits to the living room]\nFrasier: Dad...!\nMartin: Look, if you want to tell me something, write it on a post- it and stick it on the fridge.\nFrasier: Look, I really want to talk about this! [Martin finally stops and faces Frasier] I've exhausted every other possible interpretation of this dream. Is it possible my subconscious is trying to tell me something about my sexuality?\nMartin: Oh, that's ridiculous!\nFrasier: Is it? I was sensitive as a child; I didn't go in for sports. God, it's every cliche in the book. Surely it must have occurred to you at some point? You refused to take me to see \"West Side Story\" on my eighth birthday.\nMartin: Well, because of the gangs. That's scary for kids.\nFrasier: Even gangs that dance?\nMartin: Especially gangs that dance! [then] All right. Yeah... okay, yeah, I thought about it. But no, Frasier, no... I don't believe that. And you know why? Because you would have known by now. Your unconscious or whatever the hell you call it could no more have kept its yap shut than the rest of you.\nFrasier: I suppose you're right.\nMartin: Yeah. Now, come on, it's after 3:00. You're gonna be all worn out before your show tomorrow.\nFrasier: What a tragedy that would be.\nMartin: Now what are you complaining about?\nFrasier: Oh, I don't know. I just haven't had any really interesting calls lately. I'm beginning to question whether I'm not bored with psychiatry. [sits at the table]\nMartin: Boy, you'd never know it with the way you got your nose stuck in all those books.\nFrasier: That's true. The one saving grace about this dream is it's given me a chance to flex my analytical muscle a bit.\nMartin: Ah, maybe it wasn't so bad after all.\nFrasier: Wait a minute. Could that be what this has been all about? I've been so intellectually unchallenged lately by my show that my mind had to create a dream that defies interpretation just to give me a challenge?\nMartin: I don't know. Keep talking, you're making me sleepy.\nFrasier: Dad, no... that's got to be it! [stands] My show hasn't provided me with a single patient worthy of my skills and I had to invent one myself - me! Oh, God! What a relief. At last, finally, to bed. Dad, you've witnessed an epiphany!\n[they move to the hall]\nMartin: Yeah, God, I got to get you to put this on tape.\nFrasier: [o.s.] Off we go. To sleep, perchance NOT to dream.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nScene Four - The Motel Room. Frasier is once again lying in the bed, asleep. He awakens to find the tattoo is now gone and there is no more tequila bottle. He sits up and listens for the shower. Hearing nothing, he lies back, relieved. Suddenly, there is a knock on the door. Frasier sits up in surprise and says \"Come in.\" A man enters, the psychiatrist Dr. Siegmund Freud.\nFreud: Dr. Crane, Dr. Siegmund Freud.\nFrasier: Oh, my goodness! [they shake hands] It's quite an honor!\nFreud: The honor is all mine. I gave you a complex psychological problem and you solved it. You are a brilliant psychiatrist.\nFrasier: Oh, that's very flattering. You know, there are so many things I'd like to ask you!\nFreud: In good time, my boy. In good time. Right now, we have more important matters.\nHe takes out some breath freshener and sprays it into his mouth. To Frasier's astonishment, Freud then climbs into bed with Frasier and lies back, spreading out his arms for an embrace.\nCUT TO: an exterior shot of Frasier's apartment building, where we see a lone light switch on at the 19th floor. It appears Frasier is in for another sleepless night.\n[N.B. For you Frasier trivia buffs, this is the only time Frasier's apartment has been shown from an exterior point of view.]\nEnd of Act Two.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nThe clock reveals that's it's 3:10 a.m. Eddie is in the kitchen, hopping up and down, trying to grab a muffin on the kitchen counter. It is then revealed that Eddie was asleep on the couch, having his own dream. He jumps down from the couch and rushes to the kitchen. He begins to hop up and down to get a muffin, only there aren't any. He finally sulks back to the living room and lies back down, defeated.\n[N.B.

{"instructions": ["Write a summary for the scene."], "outputs": ["A minivan explodes at a car park, killing a woman. After piecing together her remains, Booth and the team realize that she is a known fugitive to the FBI for nearly thirty years. It turns out that the woman had been a member of the National Liberation Army, a leftist radical group who were presumed responsible for several crimes, in the 1970s. The case is reopened as Booth finds himself in an awkward position when his former mentor, who was the agent in charge of the case, and prosecuting attorney Caroline Julian clash. Meanwhile, Brennan visits her father, who is in prison after being arrested by Booth."], "input": "\"Soccer Mom in the Mini Van\"\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nTEASER\n(A minivan approaches a field where kids are playing soccer. A woman gets out of the car, throws her coffee cup away in a nearby trashcan and looks at the children playing. She then touches her locket, smiles and heads back towards the car. In the car, she tucks a note inside her bag. She backs out of the space and as she puts her car into drive, it explodes)\n[Cut to: Crime scene a few hours later - crawling with FBI agents. Booth and Brennan get out of the car and approach the mini van]\nBOOTH: Look, Bones, all I'm saying is that Caroline went though a lot of trouble to get you private visitation with your father, now you don't want it.\nBRENNAN: The federal detention facility already has visiting areas.\nBOOTH: Yeah, behind 2 inch glass. Now you'll be able to give your old man a hug.(he demonstrates on Brennan)\nBRENNAN: I didn't ask for special treatment, Booth.\nBOOTH: That's because you don't have to because you are special. And you are gonna tell me - whoa - what happened to whatever the hell is melted to that steering wheel and everything else.\nBRENNAN (looking at the remains): Female. Mid 40's to late 50's. Pelvis indicates she's given birth.\nBOOTH: Hey, Bones. Look at that. (points to a finger with a ring on it) Married, right?\nBRENNAN: Wedding ring. Possibility. (to another FBI Agent) Don't just focus on the ground (she points to a leg in a nearby tree then to Booth) Why do you care about my relationship with my father, Booth? You were only too happy to arrest him and put him in prison.\nBOOTH: Alright, look Bones. Ya know what, it's not about being happy, okay. It's about doing my job.\nBRENNAN: Do we know if it was a bomb that caused the explosion?\nBOOTH: Well, let's see. The roof is peeled back and the doors-\nBRENNAN: I was asking him. (she points to another FBI Agent)\nFBI AGENT: We found explosive residue all over the van and metal fragments in the bushes.\nBOOTH: What is that? A Pipe bomb?\nFBI: I can't really be sure until the explosives unit gets the van back to the lab.\nBRENNAN: No, they can't have the van. There are remains seared all over the inside of the vehicle and they can't be compromised.\nFBI AGENT: I have to call-\nBRENNAN: This van will be brought to the Jeffersonian - your bomb techs can look at it there.\nFBI AGENT: I'll....make the call?\nBOOTH: That's - that's alright. You go, go make that call. Bones, come on . You're a little harsh there, maybe you want to talk it out.\nBRENNAN: (pulls a necklace from the car) Look, Booth.\nBOOTH: It's a locket. Ugh, probably her daughter.\nBRENNAN: Who would want to blow up a soccer mom?\nACT I\n(Cut to: Jeffersonian: Forensics area)\nANGELA: Hey, you have a skull for a facial reconstruction?\nZACK: Help yourself.\nANGELA: Oh, great. Is this all I have to work with? I always hated puzzles.\nBRENNAN: Hodgins, before we take that hand from the wheel, you might want to check the fingernails for particulates.\nHODGINS: You know I do.\nANGELA: Oh. My. God.\nZACK: Shouldn't you wait for the bomb tech before you gather the explosive residue?\nHODGINS: Hey, just getting enough to verify his results. Remember, he's a government bureaucrat.\nANGELA: Hey, you're a government bureaucrat, babe.\nHODGINS: In name only. I am a passionate, dedicated scientist who will not be cowed by authoritarian pressure.\nCAM: Stay out of the van until the bomb tech comes, Hodgins.\nHODGINS: But... CAM: Out.\nHODGINS: Fine. I have to check the fingernails anyway.\nCAM (to Angela): How close are we to ID'ing the victim?\nANGELA: Well. This is the skull. I'm good, but I'm not that good.\nBRENNAN: Perhaps you could use these. There's a portion of tongue, hair and brain matter?\nANGELA: Okay. If anybody needs me, I'm gonna go throw up, then do some paper work.\n(As Angela turns to leave, Booth enters with a female agent)\nBOOTH: Okay, this is Special Agent Frost from the bomb unit.\nAGENT FROST: Booth pulled me out of an important lunch. It took me months to set up that meeting. It better be good, Booth.\nBOOTH: She'll be working with you, Hodgins.\nHODGINS (starting at Frost): Yes, please. What? No, no. Um, hmm? Ja..Hodgins. Doc - Doctor. Okay.\nAGENT FROST: I beg your pardon?\nHODGINS: It's Ho-\nANGELA: He's Dr. Jack Hodgins. Angela. Montenegro. I do facial reconstructions - and him.\nAGENT FROST: Please to meet you. (she walks over to where the stuff is ) I'm gonna need you to recover all the metallic particulates then I'm gonna need a chemical tray with-\nFROST & HODGINS: Aqueous buffer solution.\nHODGINS: Yeah. I know.\nHODGINS: You wanna perform capillary electrophoresis?\nFROST: We can do that?\nHODGINS: Oh yeah. (Angela coughs in the background) And it will save time so Angela and I can have dinner. Alone.\nANGELA: Hm (she turns and leaves)\nBOOTH: License plate was destroyed when we traced the VIN number on the van. It was registered to Jeremy Nash in Culpepper, Virginia.\nBRENNAN: He looks familiar.\nBOOTH: Man, our victim was traveling with a lot of stuff - clothes and personal items.\nBRENNAN: Photo album. Most of the pictures were burned, but the man in this photo could be Nash.\nCAM: She packed herself up, keepsakes and all, and took off in the van? Looks like Mrs. Nash was leaving Mr. Nash.\nBOOTH: Ah, god. I hate domestic cases. Alright, so let's got talk to the husband.\nBRENNAN: I can't. I'm seeing my father.\nBOOTH: Now?\nBRENNAN: You and Caroline went to a lot of trouble setting this up. I would hate to appear ungrateful.\nBOOTH: But - (he starts to follow after her, but stops then - to Cam) I'll go talk to, um, the husband by myself.\n(Cut to: Prison - Day. Max is escorted into a private visiting room to meet with Brennan)\nPRISION GUARD: Alright, Max. There ya go.\nMAX: Ooh, gee. Real chairs. It's nice to have an important daughter (he goes to kiss her but she moves away)\nBRENNAN: This is Booth, not me.\nMAX: Well, you thank him for me. I always liked Booth. Nicest guy that ever arrested me.\nBRENNAN: Touching.\nMAX: Well, you must like this. Me in here. I finally have to follow the rules.\nBRENNAN: So that makes me less than you because I think people should follow the rules?\nMAX: You're upset.\nBRENNAN: Yeah, of course I'm upset. My father's a criminal.\nMAX: No, outlaw. There's a difference.\nBRENNAN: Subtle distinctions like that are lost on me and, I imagine, your victims.\nMAX: I know you want some sort of, uh, nice, neat story that puts my life into perspective for you but it doesn't work that way.\nBRENNAN: You could try. Don't I deserve that?\nMAX: I guess I always had a problem with authority. I just always saw myself fighting the system. Kinda like Robin Hood.\nBRENNAN: Do you realize how ridiculous you sound? You're here for murdering the Deputy Director of the FBI.\nMAX: He was a crook. He was a killer and he was going to kill you.\nBRENNAN: And you walked out on Russ and me when I was fifteen!\nMAX: But that was to protect you, people were after us.\nBRENNAN: Because you were a criminal.\nMAX: Outlaw. See, I knew you weren't gonna understand.\nBRENNAN: Ya know what? You're right. This is my fault for expecting we could get past-\nMAX: We can get past this. We can. The court, they're gonna decide how to punish me but now, here - we'll make this whatever we want.\nBRENNAN: (She reaches in her bag and pulls out a deck of cards) Here are the cards you asked for. I gotta go.\nMAX: Wait. These are for us.\nBRENNAN: What?\nMAX: Come on. You remember that game we used to play when you were five years old?\nBRENNAN: Blitz.\nMAX: Blitz. Blitz. Come on. Let's play a couple of hands.\nBRENNAN: You always beat me. I remember that too. A good father would occasionally allow his child to win.\nMAX: I don't believe in encouraging all that, ah, that self esteem crap. You wanna win? Earn it. That's why you're so good at what you do now cause you know that nobody is gonna hand you anything.\nBRENNAN: (sarcastically) So you were a great father.\nMAX: Well, maybe just not as bad as you think. How 'bout this, one hand? Come on.\nBRENNAN: (gets up and heads towards the door) Let me know if you need anything else.\nMAX: Oh, oh, oh. Socks. Socks. You know the, uh, with the arch supports? I gotta stand on that chow line forever.\n(Max watches her as she leaves the room without saying anything)\n(Cut to: Nash Residence. Booth is questioning Jeremy Nash)\nJEREMY NASH: A bomb?\nBOOTH: Yeah, I'm sorry. Were you and your wife having any problems?\nJEREMY NASH: What? What kind of problems?\nBOOTH: Well, she was traveling with a lot of personal stuff: I mean, photo albums and more clothes than she -\nJEREMY NASH: That \"stuff\" was for Celia's new dorm room. She was bringing her clothes, thing to help her decorate - You're FBI for God's sakes. You have no idea who did this? What is this your first case?\nBOOTH: Just relax, okay? I'm just here to help, Mr. Nash, that's all.\nJEREMY NASH: How do I tell Celia? How do I - tell my daughter-\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Room. Focus on a clear box with flesh eating beetles inside.)\nZACK: Dermestes maculates. They clean the bones by eating the charred flesh.\nHODGINS: But they leave behind pieces of shrapnel you might need.\nAGENT FROST: Fascinating and very weird.\nZACK: (with pride) They're mine.\nAGENT FROST: Not a surprise.\n(BRENNAN enters.)\nHODGINS: (to Brennan) Hey! Hi. How as your visit with your-\nBRENNAN: Not germane to the investigation, Hodgins. (While Brennan is talking, Hodgins is looking at Agent Frost) Zack. Her left shoulder was badly shattered but still shows evidence of old trauma. I need the clean bones as soon as they're ready. I also would like you to look at the manubrium. These shadows look like pitting. Have you determined what kind of bomb was used?\nAGENT FROST: I'm still sifting through the debris and waiting for whatever goodies these bugs leave behind.\nBRENNAN: And Dr. Hodgins is just keeping you company?\nHODGINS: What? No. I'm - working. Hard. (Brennan and Zack just look at him) I'm gonna go right now and work. Hard. Some-someplace else. So - (he turns to go - Brennan and Zack still staring at him and Agent Frost looking at the beetles)\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Basement/Storage. Angela is at a computer trying to figure out some symbols for the Widows' Son case.)\nHODGINS: Hey. What are you doing down here?\nANGELA: Oh, analyzing the iconography for the Widow's Son case until somebody needs me for the bomb victim.\nHODGINS: Look, Angie, Um- Agent Frost is a colleague and I am a professional. Okay, so all that stammering and stuff - I mean that's not - that isn't - you know that's involuntary - it's a bodily thing. Yeah. That didn't come out right. Look, I'm not gonna deny that she is attractive -\nANGELA: Oh, totally hot.\nHOGDINS: What?\nANGELA: The bombshell from the Bomb Squad. She's totally hot.\nHODGINS: Yeah, I know. I mean -\nANGELA: Look, Jack. I really don't care what's going on in your pants as long as it stays in your pants.\nHODGINS: You know who's totally hot? You. You are totally -\nANGELA: Okay, save it. What have you got?\nHODGINS: (he hands her some singed pieces of paper found in the van) These were in Any Nash's bag.\nANGELA: There's writing on them.\nHODGINS: Yeah. Yeah, Cam needs you to restore them.\nANGELA: Well, I'll give it a try.\nAGENT FROST: (O.S.) Dr. Hodgins! I need your samples for the spectrometer.\nHODGINS: I - I - I - I have to uh - so I love you and - (he kisses her on the cheek)\nANGELA: Go.\nHODGINS: Okay.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hallway. Booth & Brennan are walking)\nBOOTH: Nash is gonna pick up his kid, tell her in person. I mean, I don't know how you do that. Tell your kid that your mother just got blown up?\nBRENNAN: I would think a direct approach would be best.\nBOOTH: What? As opposed to what? Sugar coating it? 'Hey, what do you say we go to the park oh and by the way, your mom just got blown up?' How's your dad? You haven't mentioned him.\nBRENNAN: Apparently, his feet hurt.\nBOOTH: You know, I mean his spirits.\nBRENNAN: Well, he's a con man, Booth. He's always cheerful.\nBOOTH: What? That's it?\nBRENNAN: It's not like I ever really had a father. Max was absent for years.\nBOOTH: Well, here's what I know. I know that Nash girl would give anything to spend one more day with her mother. I'm sure you'd feel the same way if something happened to your father.\n(Hodgins approaches them)\nHODGINS: I confirmed triphenylmethane dye and iron sulfate embedded in the manubrium and the flesh. (Booth looks at Hodgins, confused.) Both are found in ball point ink.\nBOOTH: AH! It's a home made tattoo.\nHODGINS: Angela's working on recreating the design.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office. The computer is trying to render a design of the tattoo)\nANGELA: This tattoo appears to have been crudely executed.\nBOOTH: Hm, you mean like a prison tat.\nCAM: No record of her being in prison.\nHODGINS: In Russia, prisoners made tattoo ink by burning the heel of a shoe and mixing it with soot and urine.\nBRENNAN: This was a ball point pen, rigged with a sewing needle, pushed down so deep it penetrated her periosteum.\nBOOTH: Ah! You mean - bone.\nCAM: Doesn't seem like a very soccer mom thing to do.\nANGELA: And...here we go. (the computer starts to finish the rendering)\nCAM: An inverted pentagram? Devil worship.\nHODGINS: Mom had a little thing going on the side with Satan? Oh, the burbs.\nANGELA: There is a design in the center that I can't quite get.\nHODGINS: Wait, wait, wait. Is that a fist?\nBRENNAN: A fist?\nBOOTH: A fist.\nANGELA: Yeah. Oh my God. It is a fist.\nHODGINS: So she wasn't Satan's old lady - she was in the NLA.\nANGELA: NLA?\nBOOTH: National Liberation Army.\nHODGINS: Student radicals in the 70's. Thought they could change the world. Set off bombs in army recruiting offices, torched cop cars-\nBOOTH: Yeah, real visionaries. They also shot and killed a cop in '75.\nHODGINS: That was the burglary. They broke into house of a defense contractor to rip off his safe- said it was the people's money. Here. June Harris and her boyfriend, Neil Watkins were charged with the murder, but never found.\nBOOTH: The FBI's been looking for them for 30 years.\nCAM: And there they are.\nANGELA: And our victim? (she does a side by side comparison of June Harris & Amy Nash) It's the same woman.\nBRENNAN: So, our soccer mom - was a killer.\nACT II\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Forensics Platform.)\nCAROLINE: People! Please tell me that all your fancy ass equipment is wrong.\nBOOTH: Oh! (He covers his ears as she sets off the alarm as she enters the platform and a security guy swipes his card.)\nBRENNAN: You're not supposed to be up here.\nCAROLINE: Booth can shoot me later. (she looks at the remains laid out on the table) This can not be June Harris.\nBRENNAN: But the dentals match. Angela's reconstruction matches.\nBOOTH: Amy Nash was June Harris.\nCAROLINE: Por qui moi? She couldn't have waited 4 days to turn herself into a charcoal briquette?\nBRENNAN: I - don't understand.\nBOOTH: Caroline? Why are you here?\nCAROLINE: June Harris was turning herself in. I arranged with her attorney for the surrender. He was gonna deliver her on Thursday after she said goodbye to her family.\nBRENNAN: What was the deal?\nCAROLINE: 9 years.\nBOOTH: 9 years for killing a cop?\nCAROLINE: For turning herself in and laying this all to rest. And since she still maintained her innocence, this was going to be a tough case to prosecute.\nBOOTH: Sam Reilly was the lead on this case for 30 years. He was okay with 9 years?\nCAROLINE: He doesn't know. Part of the deal. He wasn't to be consulted.\nBOOTH: Well, you know what? It's okay to tell him now. I know Sam. He deserves that much after 30 years.\nCAROLINE: Up to you, you're the lead now, Cher. You should bring in Huntzinger. He was her attorney. He might know something.\nHODGINS: Love Huntzinger. Real old time lefty. Worked the Chicago 7 Trial. Sued Nixon, the CIA, Bush -\nBOOTH: That's great, let's get out of here before Hodgins gives him the pinko medal of honor. (to Brennan) Are you coming?\nBRENNAN: I can't. Zack and I have to pull the rest of the shrapnel for the bomb tech and then I have to buy some socks for my dad.\nCAROLINE: Leave her be, Cher. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\nBOOTH: (turning back to Brennan as Caroline drags him out) Socks?\n(Cut to: FBI - Agent Sam Reilly, Booth & Caroline are coming out of a conference room - and start to walk down the hallway.)\nAGENT SAM REILLY: I have worked this case for 30 years and you don't think I deserve a phone call?\nCAROLINE: It was part of the deal.\nSAM: And you Booth. I trained you. You think this is right? To blow me off like this?\nBOOTH: I just got thrown the case, Sam. Don't go wailing on me.\nSAM: Damn lawyers. Working the case for 30 years and you don't think it deserves a damn phone call. Hey. I'm talking to you. (Booth and Caroline turn around)\nCAROLINE: No. You're yelling at me and my ears are starting to ring. Now I'm sorry after 40 years, as an agent for the FBI, you're still a little girl but I'd like to find out who killed June Harris. So how 'bout you stop whining and help. Okay, Cher?\n(Caroline leaves)\nBOOTH: So. How have ya been , Sam?\nSAM: Shut up, Booth.\n(Cut to: FBI - Observation Room. Sam watches as Caroline & Booth interrogate Leonard Huntzinger)\nCAROLINE: So what's in the bag, Lenny.\nHUNTZINGER: Toothbrush, change of underwear. You guys always find some reason to toss me in the can. No belt. No laces. I'm ready.\nBOOTH: Yeah. Great. Well, we just want to ask you a few questions about June Harris's death.\nHUNTZINGER: I loved June Harris. I loved what she stood for and what she did with her life. Nobody has her balls anymore.\nCAROLINE: Except maybe, Neil Watkins.\nHUNTZINGER: Yeah. You'd love that, wouldn't you. Blame another revolutionary.\nBOOTH: Do you know where Watkins is?\nCAROLINE: They were partners in crime. I don't think he would want to risk June turning him in.\nHUNTZINGER: You ever hear of attorney/client privilege?\nCAROLINE: Ever hear of Obstruction of Justice?\nBOOTH: Ya know, a woman is dead. She's not a martyr to her family, just someone they loved.\nCAROLINE: If you can understand that.\nHUNTZINGER: Cooperating with that system (Sam leaves the observation room) perpetuates that system..\nBOOTH: Yeah, yeah.\nHUNTZINGER: If the system's corrupt-\nBOOTH: Blah, blah, blah. So what's next, Leonard? Are ya gonna warn Watkins that we're on to him?\n(Sam bursts through the door and goes after Huntzinger)\nBOOTH: Sam. Sam. Sam. Sam.\nSAM: You son of a bitch. Watkins are Harris are not heroes. (Booth holds Sam back) You want to know how they changed society? Ask the kid who's father they killed.\nHUNTZINGER: I know that kid. He became a cop just like his father. Very touching.\n(Sam goes to go after Huntzinger again and Huntzinger pushes him back.)\nSAM: You son of a-\nHUNTZINGER: Get out of here.\n(Booth steps in again and holds Huntzinger back.)\nBOOTH: Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.\nCAROLINE: You just hit a Federal Agent, Mr. Huntzinger. Good thing you brought your toothpaste.\nHUNTZINGER: What a surprise. Lock me up to shut me up. You should be talking to that kid, Valenti, instead of busting my ass. The pig comes to me the other day, he wants to know where June is. He said he got a letter from her, as if she's write him or I'd give her up. Hey. (He lifts up his shirt) See these bruises? A gift - from your noble son of a cop.\n(Cut to: Prison - Day. Max is in the visitors room with Brennan.)\nMAX: Nice and soft. I'll be the best dressed on cell block 8. Thanks.\nBRENNAN: Sure.\nMAX: (sighs) Honey. I'm sorry.\nBRENNAN: For what?\nMAX: For- for being such a disappointment as a father. You deserve better. And I should have told you sooner. (Brennan says nothing) Well, that's it? Nothing?\nBRENNAN: Well, what were you expecting? I agree with you.\nMAX: I was expecting some tears or a hug or something. I did apologize. That's what you wanted, isn't it?\nBRENNAN: Well, you didn't mean it?\nMAX: Of course I meant it. Listen. Under any objective standard you have a horrible human being for a father but I'm trying to move on. I got caught so that I could be with you. I was hoping you'd meet me half way.\nBRENNAN: I'm here, aren't I? (after a pause) I - (she reaches into her bag) got you shampoo. Soap isn't good for your hair.\nMAX: Oh, nice. I - I don't want to smell to good, that could be a problem around here.\n(Brennan smiles) There, see. That's better. Thanks.\nBRENNAN: Sure.\nMAX: So the prosecutor's gonna want to talk to you about me. It wouldn't hurt if you, uh, had some good things to say about your old man. Might even offer to testify on my behalf.\nBRENNAN: Is that why you finally apologized?\nMAX: What?\nBRENNAN: To use me? Maybe you'd like me to alter evidence now. That way I could join the family business.\nMAX: How could you think that?\nBRENNAN: I don't know, Max. Maybe because I seem to pass in and out of your life when it's most convenient. Maybe because you built a whole career using your considerable charm to manipulate people?\nMAX: Wait, listen. I know that it's hard to trust me, I know, and it's gonna take some time to fix things, but we can -\nBRENNAN: No. No. Some things break and you can't put them back together again. That's just the way it is. I was find on my own, Max. I was just fine. (she gets up and leaves)\nMAX: Wait, please. (he's left in the room, alone)\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hodgins work area)\nAGENT FROST: Electrophoresis in HPLC shows potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur in a 75/15/10 ratio.\nHODGINS: Graphite glaze, triple F goex. Supporting grade -\nAGENT FROST: You are a constant surprise.\nHODGINS: Yes. Yes, I am.\nAGENT FROST: I don't know many people who get as excited as I do about the chemical makeup of explosives.\nHODGINS: Well, I - complex molecular structures. Hey, how's it coming - with the-the-the detonator?\nAGENT FROST: Seems to be a wristwatch. Pretty much destroyed in the blast.\nHODGINS: (looking in the microscope) Microscopic glass chips. Probably the crystal. I'll, uh, take a look at the -uh (Frost leans over him and looks in the microscope) composition to see if I can - um - locate a - manufacturer.\nAGENT FROST: Great. So, where do you want me to dump this junk?\nHODGINS: You're tossing the air filter?\nAGENT FROST: I tested it for explosive residue. There wasn't any. It was blown free from the car.\nHODGINS: Yeah. Even better. Do you have any idea what kind of treasures might be trapped in here? Don't touch my things. (to security guard) Watch her.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Zack is showing Cam his findings)\nCAM: She was shot too?\nZACK: The entry presented itself when I was removing shrapnel from the reconstructed shoulder.\nCAM: Are you sure it's not from the bomb or the fire?\nZACK: No. The fragments are lead in a copper alloy coating.\nCAM: Yeah. That's a bullet. I didn't find any dried blood on her clothes. When was she shot?\nZACK: Damage from the blast makes it difficult to tell when the shooting occurred. I'm going to check the remodeling to estimate a time.\nCAM: Hitting the top of the shoulder wouldn't be severe injury.\nZACK: She could bandage herself and still be ambulatory.\nCAM: You know you could say 'walk around' instead. I wouldn't fire you.\nZACK: 'Walk around' implies aimlessness, which I'm not able to determine.\nCAM: Can't believe I still ask these things. Send every thing you got to ballistics at the FBI.\nZACK: I'll inform Dr. Brennan.\n(Cut to FBI: Corridor. Booth, Brennan and Sam are walking)\nSAM: Does not make any sense. The van was rigged blow up, why shoot her?\nBRENNAN: Well, until we see what ballistics determines, it's absurd to speculate.\nSAM: Speculating's kinda what we do here.\nBOOTH: Listen. Danny Valenti is a cop. June Harris murdered his father. He has a gun.\nSAM: He's a good kid, Booth. He didn't do it.\nBOOTH: (Brennan bumps into him, then to Brennan) Out.\nBRENNAN: But that is meaningless speculation.\nSAM: Is she really necessary?\nBOOTH: She's my partner.\nBRENNAN: Mentors often feel threatened when their students surpass them.\nBOOTH: Bones!\nBRENNAN: Well, it's true, Booth. Change can be difficult to accept whether it comes in the form of a revolutionary or the simple passage of time.\nSAM: If she were a guy, I'd deck her.\nBRENNAN: Well, you know, that distinction is no longer necessary, but I wouldn't recommend it. (Booth pushes Brennan into the interrogation room)\nBOOTH: Go, Sam. (Booth pushes Sam into the interrogation room) Thank you.\n(Cut to: FBI - Interrogation Room.)\nBOOTH: Officer Valenti, credit card records show that uh, you bought gas near June Harris's home.\nVALENTI: I didn't know where she lived. Just the town from the post mark on the letter.\nBOOTH: Her apology letter.\nVALENTI: (scoffs) She should have had the nerve to come talk to me, face to face.\nBOOTH: So that's when you went to Huntzinger.\nVALENTI: Yeah.\nBRENNAN: And hit him.\nVALENTI: He protects people like her.\nBRENNAN: That's his job.\nVALENTI: I was five years old when my father was killed. My mother told me he wasn't coming home again, I didn't believe her. I sat by that window waiting, everyday, for months.\nBOOTH: You seem pretty angry about that.\nSAM: Why didn't you tell me what you were gonna do?\nVALENTI: You'd try and talk me out of it.\nBRENNAN: Did you know how little time she was going to serve?\nBOOTH: Because that might make someone take matters into their own hands.\nVALENTI: I'm a cop, man, I didn't blow her up.\nSAM: Booth-\nBOOTH: Sam, it's my investigation. Officer Valenti, I'm gonna need your gun.\nVALENTI: Why?\nBOOTH: Because June Harris was shot before she died.\nBRENNAN: We'd like to make sure the bullet didn't come from your gun.\nVALENTI: You're gonna let them do this to me, Sam?\nSAM: It's just a formality, Danny.\nVALENTI: Then let's be formal. Get a warrant.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nACT III\n(Cut to: FBI - Booth's Office. Sam is alone reading a folder - as Booth & Brennan enter.)\nBOOTH: Sam!\nSAM: Ballistics says that the bullet was NOT a match for Danny's gun.\nBRENNAN: Booth should have that report first. He's the lead.\nSAM: You know, Booth. She must be really good in bed because I can't see any other reason you keep her around here.\nBRENNAN: I am. Very good. But Booth has no direct knowledge of that fact.\nBOOTH: Okay, okay. Let's all stay focused here, people. Okay. Sam, you know what - you should never-\nSAM: But it was a match for the gun that killed Danny's father 30 years ago.\nBOOTH: Right. The same gun that was registered to Harris's old boyfriend, Watkins, but it was never found.\nSAM: Everyone we interviewed at the time said Harris would never make a move without talking to Watkins first. I told you, we need to find him.\nBOOTH: Yeah, okay. We will, Sam. You just gotta give me some room.\n(Booth goes to leave but Sam grabs him arm)\nSAM: Hey, Booth. Don't cut me out. I've worked my whole career for this.\nBOOTH: As soon as I find something out, I'll let you know, Sam. (he places him hand on Sam's arm and then heads out) (to Brennan) Come on, Bones.\n(They leave, leaving Sam alone, once again, in Booth's office)\n(Cut to: Nash Residence. Jeremy Nash is looking at a picture that Booth & Brennan gave to him to look at)\nJEREMY: I remember seeing a picture of him before. I was going through some old photographs, cleaning out a closet. Amy said it was an old boyfriend.\nBOOTH: Hmm. They keep in contact?\nJEREMY: No. I mean, uh, she would have told me. Why? You don't think that - did he kill her?\nBOOTH: How long did you know about your wife's real identity?\nBRENNAN: Yeah, how long?\nJEREMY: I only found out a couple weeks ago.\n(His daughter, Celia, enters the room)\nCELIA: Why didn't you tell me? What? You didn't think I should know about my own mother?\nJEREMY: She didn't want me to tell you. She wanted to do it herself.\nBRENNAN: Your wife never talked about her past?\nCELIA: She used to say only the future was important. All we could do was change the world.\nJEREMY: They didn't agree on how. Celia was, uh, a bit conservative for Amy.\nCELIA: That never mattered. She wasn't some crazy radical to me. She was my mom.\nBOOTH: You must have been relieved she got such a great deal.\nJEREMY: What deal?\nBRENNAN: She didn't tell you?\nJEREMY: She mentioned she was thinking of talking to a Federal Prosecutor - but I talked her out of it.\nBOOTH: Well, you do know it's a felony, aiding and abedding a fugitive.\nJEREMY: You want to charge me? Fine. But saving my family doesn't feel like a crime. Amy was a good mother. A wonderful wife.\nBOOTH: You mind if we take a look around? See if there's any evidence linking your wife to Watkins?\nJEREMY: The house is yours. (to Celia) Come on, sweetie.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab.)\nZACK: The only reason we found any lead or copper in the shoulder was because of the blast. There was advanced bone remodeling.\nCAM: So it's a very old injury.\nZACK: Yes. Bone had completely grown over it.\nCAM: And since it was the same gun that killed the policeman and was never recovered, I think we can assume that June Harris was shot during the robbery.\nZACK: I also found microscopic lead particles on the metacarpals on the left hand with the same degree of remodeling at the shoulder.\nCAM: Another gun shot?\nZACK: No. The same one. The metals are an identical match.\nCAM: So she was shot in the hand and the shoulder with the same bullet? Is that even possible?\nZACK: Angela could give us a scenario that could tell us.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office - everyone is standing around the Angelator)\nANGELA: I'm creating a trajectory analysis factoring in both the hand and the shoulder. These are photos from the crime scene, 30 years ago.\nZACK: That's the home of the defense contractor, Gerald Locklear, where the NLA burglary occurred.\nCAM: June Harris and NealWatkins were in Locklear's office at the back of the house.\nANGELA: The original FBI photos were crude. Based on finger prints and scuff marks on the floor. It was assumed that June stood guard while Neal emptied the safe.\nCAM: When officer Valenti walks in, surprising them, June fires - killing Valenti -\nBRENNAN: But that wouldn't explain her injuries, unless - June emptied the safe while Neal stood guard.\nANGELA: Exactly. Neal aims at Office Valenti but June steps between them, raises her hand to stop Neal, but he fires.\nBRENNAN: She was trying to protect the policeman.\nCAM: June Harris was telling the truth. She didn't kill Valenti, Neal Watkins did.\n(Hodgins enters)\nHODGINS: He also made the bomb. The watch used to make the timer? Was coated with a volatilized pigment used by the Sawyer Time Company.\n(They all head over to the computer. Hodgins pulls up a picture of a watch)\nBRENNAN: An American flag watch.\nCAM: Nice ironic touch.\nHODGINS: Watkins always used the same type of watch when making bombs for the NLA. It was a signature. They found traces of them a ROTC headquarters, the IRS office-\nCAM: June told him she was going to turn herself in.\nHODGINS: He wasn't gonna let that happen. So he made a new bomb using an old watch and killed her. And he left a message for anyone who thought the revolution was over.\nANGELA: Sounds like a bad ex-boyfriend.\nBRENNAN: That's assuming she was in contact with him.\nCAM: And we have no way of knowing where that would have taken place if she had seen him.\nHODGINS: Not so sure about that. I have her air filter. It's like an entomological GPS.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Cat walk. Booth is looking out over the balcony. Brennan approaches him, carrying a cup of coffee)\nBOOTH: What's taking Hodgins so long?\nBRENNAN: It's an exacting process.\n(She hands him the cup of coffee)\nBOOTH: (takes it) Ah, thank you. So um, how did your dad like his socks?\nBRENNAN: Fine.\nBOOTH: That's sorta a way to start a conversation there, Bones.\nBRENNAN: I know.\nBOOTH: Ya know, look. I'm - I should never have gotten in the middle of all this, I'm - I'm sorry. I was just - I'm just trying to help.\nBRENNAN: He wanted me to testify on his behalf. He just wants to use me.\nBOOTH: Well, he's s con man, Bones, that doesn't mean that he doesn't love you. He's just looking for a little payback.\nBRENNAN: Payback?\nBOOTH: Yeah. He's thinking that he got arrested so that he could spend some more time with you. I mean, you could at least return the favor by doing something nice for him.\nBRENNAN: I'm not sure I want a father who's always keeping score.\nBOOTH: Yeah. Sounds like you are too.\nBRENNAN: You know what? You're right. This is none of your business.\nBOOTH: You know what, Bones? You're never gonna forgive yourself if you don't cut the guy some slack just because you're afraid to get hurt.\nBRENNAN: Ugh, what the hell is taking Hodgins so long?\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hodgins desk. He's looking through a microscope when Angela approaches)\nANGELA: Where's the bombshell from the bomb squad?\nHODGINS: She went back to the FBI to catalog evidence. Thank god. She was driving me crazy. It was just science all the time. Then, she tries to destroy perfectly good evidence-\nANGELA: What about the breasts?\nHODGINS: I started thinking about them dragging on the floor when she's 70. (Angela leans over and kisses him) How are you doing?\nANGELA: Well, that burned paper? Is a letter that she wrote. So I'm using the spectral comparator to locate the ink particles.\nHODGINS: Cool...\nANGELA: The, uh, computer is rendering the content now, so. You?\nHODGINS: I found pollen.\nANGELA: oh.\nHODGINS: Most of it Pinus Appalachiana. Shenandoah (he has a realization about something) Pine - which is only found on Shenandoah Mountain in West Virginia. There was also crushed Pendleton Leather Flower in the tire treads which is only found here in the Shale Barrens along the upper Potamic - it is very secluded between the towns of Hendersonville and Maple Flats. Booth! (he calls up to Booth, still up on the catwalk with Brennan) I know where you can find Watkins! (They start to head down.)\nANGELA: That's nice work, Hodgins. You know, my computer, is gonna be rendering for a while. Wanna go to the Medieval storage room?\n(He reaches down and pushes the head covering for a suit of armor out from under his desk with his foot)\nANGELA: Oh.\nHODGINS: Booth! What the hell is taking you so long. (Angela kisses him again)\n(Cut to: Booth's car.)\nBRENNAN: You told Reilly where Watkins is?\nBOOTH: Yeah, he's meeting us there.\nBRENNAN: He's too emotional.\nBOOTH: This is his case. He's invested.\nBRENNAN: He's irrational. Probably male menopause.\nBOOTH: What? He's a good man and you know what? There's no such thing. That is a sexist myth.\nBRENNAN: Factually, hormone production drops in your 50's. Sexual desire decreases. You have to deal with the reduction of muscle mass, erectile dysfunction-\nBOOTH: Hey, alright, hey. Let's just keep the conversation up, shall we?\nBRENNAN: And, there's evidence that certain men become very unstable.\nBOOTH: Do you want me to start talking about your father again?\nBRENNAN: You're very testy.\nBOOTH: And 35. I'm only 35.\nBRENNAN: Okay, okay.\nBOOTH: They have blue pills for that.\n(Cut to: Watkin's Residence. Booth & Brennan get out of the car and walk towards the house.)\nBOOTH: No. I don't like this, it's too quiet.\nBRENNAN: Wasn't Reilly suppose to meet us?\nBOOTH: Yeah.\n(They go around the side of the house, trying to get a look inside. Brennan takes out her gun)\nBOOTH: Gee, why didn't you bring the big one?\n(They enter the house and walk through the rooms, still not seeing anyone. Suddenly, Brennan sees something in the other room.)\nBOOTH: Okay. (he pushes her shoulder back, wanting her to stay behind him) Bones.\n(They walk into the room and find Neal Watkins dead and Sam Reilly standing over him, holding a gun)\nBOOTH: Easy, Sam. Put the gun down, step away from the body.\nSAM: Booth, look at him. He did it to himself. I didn't do this, Booth.\n(Sam places his gun on the arm of the couch)\nACT VI\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Autopsy Bay.)\nCAM: .38 caliber slug - matches the revolver found at the scene. Now positioning is consistent with a self inflicted gun shot wound but could easily have been staged.\n(Brennan and Zack are looking at x-rays on a screen)\nBRENNAN: Zack, bring up that hand x-ray. (it appears on the screen) Look at this.\nZACK: Asymmetric narrowing on the first metacarpal phalangeal joints.\nBRENNAN: Ulna deviation, barely discernible.\nZACK: Would you like my finger Dr. Brennan?\nBRENNAN: Please.\nCAM: What are you two thinking?\nBRENNAN: Neal Watkins had rheumatoid Arthritis in his hands. (she wraps Zack's finger with an ace bandage) This would approximate the strength of his arthritic finger. Pull. (she grabs Zack's finger and he tries to pull it away.) Harder.\nZACK: I'm trying, Dr. Brennan.\nBRENNAN: Watkins fine motor function would be no greater than Zack's gauzed wrapped finger.\nCAM: Neal Watkins wasn't able to pull the trigger.\nBRENNAN: He couldn't have shot himself.\nZACK: If he couldn't pull the trigger, he wouldn't have the manual dexterity to assemble the bomb either.\nCAM: There's one man who knew exactly how Neal made his bombs.\nBRENNAN: The same man who worked the case for 30 years. I'll call Booth.\n(Cut to: FBI - Interrogation Room. Sam is pacing. Booth & Caroline enter.)\nBOOTH: Hi Sam. Dr. Brennan determined that it wasn't a suicide.\nSAM: What?\nCAROLINE: The gun was a plant. Wouldn't be the fist time - an Agent planted a gun, would it?\nBOOTH: Well, Forensics searched the house and, uh, they determined that there wasn't enough evidence to suggest that Watkins made the bomb that killed Harris.\nSAM: What about the watch?\nBOOTH: That's the thing, Sam. It turns out that two Sawyer Company American Flag watches were confiscated in '74 in LA raid.\nCAROLINE: We checked the evidence locker. A lot of things were missing - including a watch.\nSAM: It was a dog case, Booth. That crap was moved off site years ago. You know what happens during a move.\nCAROLINE: So, you had a 30 year obsession but you didn't keep track of your evidence. You have a good service record, cher. We can make a deal.\nSAM: Look. I know you have to do this dance, but there is a real killer out there.\nBOOTH: Look, I understand, Sam. I do. I think - you should find yourself a lawyer.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hodgins approaches the platform)\nHODGINS: I was cataloging the watch debris and noticed that the oxidation and bacterial erosion of the metal was inconsistent with watches that would have been stored in evidence for 30 years.\nCAM: But weren't the watches discontinued after '76?\nHODGINS: Yes, but I found a few available on line for collectors - still sealed.\nBRENNAN: You traced one to a buyer?\nHODGINS: Didn't have to. Since the watch was 30 years old, the bomber had to put in a new battery - he left behind a thumb print. The casing protected it during the blast. I asked the bureau to run the print.\n(Angela enters)\nANGELA: The letter has finished rendering. It's not addressed to Watkins.\n(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's office. Brennan picks up a copy of the rendered letter)\nBRENNAN: (V.O) Dear Celia. I've done terrible things in my life, things I can't change. I know how much pain this will cause you, but never forget how much I love you. I know we didn't always agree on how, but we both hope for the same thing, a just world.\n(Cut to: Nash residence. Jeremy & Celia Nash heading out of their house as Booth & Brennan are walking up the walkway towards them.)\nBRENNAN: (to Booth) Funerals today?\nBOOTH: Yeah.\nBRENNAN: They seem like every other, normal, grieving family.\nBOOTH: That's what everyone seems, is it.\nBOOTH: Mr. Nash? You're under arrest for the murder of June Harris, AKA Amy Nash.\nCELIA: Oh, that's crazy.\nBOOTH: I'm sorry, Celia. (Brennan hands her the letter) We know about the watch.\n(Celia reads the letter while Brennan's V.O. continues)\nBRENNAN: (V.O.) Even thought I didn't fire the gun that took that man's life, I have to take responsibility for it and for my cowardice, hiding all these years.)\nJEREMY: I caught her sneaking out one night. She had been seeing him. She betrayed me, Celia. She betrayed us.\nCELIA: How could you do this?\nJEREMY: 25 years I believed she loved us but she used us to keep her cover-\nBOOTH: Let's go.\n(As Booth walks Nash to the car, Brennan stays behind with Celia - V.O. Continues)\nBRENNAN: (V.O.) - I tried to spare you and your father pain. I know what your father thought when he caught me going to see Neal, but I would rather die than betray your father.\nCELIA: (to Jeremy) She was trying to get him to surrender too! (Jeremy turns back to her) She was trying to do the right thing, daddy.\nBOOTH: Let's go. You got the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you-\n(Celia continues reading the letter while Brennan comforts her)\nBRENNAN: (V.O.) If I've learned anything, it's that we can never let the chaos and injustice make us so blind with anger that we become part of the problem. Understanding, compassion, kindness and the only true revolutionary ideas. When we compromise those, we become what we despise and we lose our humanity. The world might see my legacy of one of violence and destruction, but I know that you are my real legacy and for that - I will be thankful everyday.\n(Cut to: Prison. Visitation Room.)\nMAX: Hi! I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.\nBRENNAN: I thought maybe we could see if we remember that card game?\nMAX: Yeah, sure. (He pulls out a deck of cards from his pocket)\n(Cut to: FBI - Booth's office. Sam enters.)\nSAM: You know, I've kept this bottle of single malt on my desk since '75. I always said when we put this case to bed, I'd open it. I'd like you to help me with that, Booth.\nBOOTH: Listen, Sam. I - I want to apologize.\nSAM: Hey. I would have done the same thing myself (he pours Booth some Scotch.) Well, maybe not quite the same thing. I would have slapped me around a little bit. (Booth laughs.) To the changing of the guard. (they clink glasses and drink)\n(Cut to: Prison. Visitation Room. Brennan and her dad are playing cards.)\n(Cut to: Lincoln Memorial. It's night and Booth and Brennan are on the steps, talking. Booth is playing with the lid on his cup of coffee.)\nBRENNAN: How much scotch did you drink?\nBOOTH: Oh, just enough. You know, I would have invited you, but Reilly. He just - wow - he doesn't like you.\nBRENNAN: I understand.\nBOOTH: I'm sorry. Was that rude?\nBRENNAN: Not from someone who's been drinking.\nBOOTH: God, you know, I love this place. I love it. I love this country. You know, I tell ya something. If I was working law enforcement back in the day when they threw all that tea, alright, in the harbor - I'm good, alright, I'm - I'm good. I would have rounded everybody up and we'd still be English.\nBRENNAN: Ya think?\nBOOTH: Yup. Yup. Definitely. (he signs and takes a sip of coffee)\nBRENNAN: I saw my father.\nBOOTH: Wow. I didn't think that you were gonna - do that.\nBRENNAN: As an Anthropologist, I accept change as the natural order of things - but with him I didn't allow for transformation. Ya know, I predicated his behavior based on a set of outmoded preconceptions. It wasn't rational.\nBOOTH: Wow. I - I didn't get any of that.\nBRENNAN: If I was conducting an objective experiment on my father, observing his behavior, I'd have to conclude that he loves me.\nBOOTH: Hmm. Why? What happened?\nBRENNAN: We played cards.\nBOOTH: Cool.\nBRENNAN: I killed him.\nBOOTH: Good for you.\n(He leans up against Brennan's shoulder and it fades out with the two of them looking out at the Washington Monument)", "source": "tv_show_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing.\nHilda: No dear. It's not.\nRachel: No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in, it was nice to meet you.\nHilda: Thank you! Good meeting you.\nRachel: All right. (Hilda exits) I'm a total pro!\n(There's a knock on the door and a handsome man enters.)\nMan: Hello?\nRachel: (seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall.\nMan: Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.\nRachel: Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?\nMan: Tag Jones.\nRachel: Uh-huh, go on.\nTag: That's it. That's my whole name.\nRachel: That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)\nTag: I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh...\nRachel: Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!\nTag: It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn...\nRachel: Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in and sits in their easy chair.]\nChandler: No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)\nPhoebe: (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.\nMonica: (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.\nChandler: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?\nMonica: I can't tell you. It's a secret.\nChandler: Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.\nMonica: Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.\nChandler: No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.\nMonica: Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?\nChandler: Oh no-no, I can't do that.\nMonica: If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.\nChandler: Okay.\nMonica: Okay.\nChandler: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.\nMonica: Oh my God. He threw up?\nChandler: No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe's secret?\nMonica: Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired.\nChandler: That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?\nMonica: That's right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]\nRachel: Chandler, you have an assistant right?\nChandler: (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!\nRachel: No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy...\nChandler: What about him?\nRachel: I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.\nPhoebe: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified.\nRachel: Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!\nPhoebe: Let's see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)\nRachel: Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!\nChandler: Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!\n[Scene: The Days of Our Lives producer's office, Joey is entering to find Terry there.]\nTerry: Hey-hey-hey Joey!\nJoey: Hey Terry!\nTerry: Good to see you again!\nJoey: It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller than they used to.\nTerry: It's a different building.\nJoey: So! Stryker Ramoray huh? When do you want me to start?\nTerry: Why don't we start right now!\nJoey: Okay.\nTerry: Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)\nJoey: (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.\nTerry: Why would you think that?\nJoey: Well, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?\nTerry: Everybody has to audition.\nJoey: Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.\nTerry: I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.\nJoey: Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!\n[Scene: Rachel's office, she's there as Tag knocks on the door and enters carrying a plant.]\nRachel: Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?\nTag: I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... (Notices her plant) There is a plant in your office.\nRachel: Kinda.\nTag: Right. So I guess I shouldn't put \"good at noticing stuff\" on my resume. (Sets the plant down on her desk.)\nRachel: Oh-ohh, thank you.\nTag: Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody.\nRachel: Well...\nTag: Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)\nRachel: But I hired you!\nTag: What?\nRachel: Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!\nTag: I am?!\nRachel: Yeah!\nTag: I can't believe it!\nRachel: Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is setting the table for dinner as Chandler enters.]\nChandler: Hey.\nMonica: Hey! Good, you're home!\nChandler: Oh it's always nicer to hear than, \"Aw crap! You again!\"\nMonica: Hey baby. (Kisses him.)\nChandler: Hey.\nMonica: I made you a surprise.\nChandler: Oh yeah?\nMonica: Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them.\nChandler: Did you not understand the story?\nRoss: (entering) Hey!\nChandler: Hey! What's up?\nMonica: Ross!\nRoss: Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.\nChandler: Huh.\nRoss: (notices the table) Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?\nChandler: No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!\nRoss: What you got over there? Tacos?\nMonica: No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)\nRoss: Uhh, those are tacos.\nMonica: Excuse me Mr. Mexico.\nRoss: Eh, either way I'll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can't eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What's so funny?!\nMonica: (trying not to laugh) I'm not laughing.\n(Ross and Chandler move closer to her and she starts laughing again.)\nRoss: (To Chandler) You told her!\nChandler: Nancy Thompson's getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)\nRoss: (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I chose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, \"Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!\"\nMonica: You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)\nRoss: (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!\nChandler: I had to okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!\nRoss: Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.\nChandler: Du-ude!\nMonica: (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!\nRoss: Well, Chandler and I are in a bar...\nChandler: Did you not hear me say, \"Du-ude?!\"\nRoss: And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls.\nMonica: (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.\nChandler: In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.\nRoss: Oh Mon, I laughed so hard...\nChandler: Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?\nRoss: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe is giving Joey a massage as Rachel enters.]\nRachel: Hi!\nJoey: Hey.\nPhoebe: Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?\nRachel: Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.\nJoey: Was she happy you gave her the job?\nRachel: Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.\n(The phone rings and Joey answers it.)\nJoey: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To Phoebe and Rachel) It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like they're taking it off the air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!\nPhoebe: Sorry.\nRachel: I'm sorry Joey.\nJoey: Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!\n(Phoebe and Rachel both pause, look at each other, and go press their breasts against him. Which Joey doesn't mind, of course.)\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are still giving away all of their secrets.]\nChandler: You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!\nRoss: All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!\nChandler: Ross came in fourth and cried!\nMonica: Oh my God! (Laughing)\nRoss: Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!\nMonica: I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!\nRoss: Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.\nMonica: Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!\nRoss: Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!\nMonica: It's hard for some people!\nChandler: (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow-whoa!\nMonica: Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!\nChandler: Hey!!!\nMonica: Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of any more for Ross!\nRoss: Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!\nChandler: That was you!\nRoss: Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is still bumming about cancellation of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.]\nJoey: How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!\nRachel: Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?\nJoey: Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.\nPhoebe: What happened?\nJoey: Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.\nRachel: Joey, why would you do that?\nJoey: Because they wanted me to audition!\nPhoebe: You! An actor?! That's madness!\n[Scene: Rachel's Outer Office, Tag is sitting at his desk as Rachel walks up. She stops and watches him pick up the phone.]\nTag: Rachel Green's office. (Hangs up.)\nRachel: Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that?\nTag: (shyly) Nobody. I was just practicing.\nRachel: Really? (Giggles.)\n(Phoebe rounds the corner.)\nPhoebe: Hi!\nTag: Hi! Rachel Green's office.\nPhoebe: You must be Hilda.\nRachel: Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second? (Goes into office.)\nTag: Phoebe! That's a great name.\nPhoebe: Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.\nRachel: (grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We'll be right back. (They go into her office and she closes the door.)\nPhoebe: So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?\nRachel: All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you...\nPhoebe: But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.\nRachel: Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There's a knock on the door.) Yes?\n(Kathy enters (Because she's listed in the credits).)\nKathy: Hey Rachel!\nRachel: Hi!\nKathy: Cute assistant! What's his story? Is he...\nRachel: Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)\n[Scene: Terry's office, Joey has come to beg for a second chance.]\nJoey: Hey! Terry.\nTerry: Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! (Gets up) I gotta go Joey.\nJoey: Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.\nTerry: I can't help you Joey.\nJoey: Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.\n[Cut to a hospital room set on the Days of Our Lives stage. Two nurses are standing next to a bed with a man whose face is completely covered in bandages and reading his chart.]\nNurse #1: This poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.\nNurse #2: It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramoray's a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.\n(Stryker enters, only it's not Joey playing him.)\nDr. Stryker Ramoray: Good morning. (He walks over to the bed, leans down, and whispers to him.) Drake, it's your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?\nThe Director: And cut!\nJoey: (jumping up and removing the bandages) I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, and Ross are sitting there and not talking to each other.]\nMonica: Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.\nRoss: And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!\nChandler: (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?\nMonica: No!\nChandler: Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)\nMonica: I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)\nChandler: Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?\nMonica: Yeah?\nChandler: Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.\nMonica: Ohh, absolutely.\nRoss: And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.\nMonica: Yeah, definitely!\nRoss: Okay, (gets up) if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story.\nMonica: Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe.\nRoss: Man! (Monica mouths, \"I'm sorry.\")\nChandler: Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office.\n(Ross storms out.)\nEnding Credits\n[Scene: Rachel's office, she's looking at a picture of Tag when he knocks and enters.]\nRachel: (noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)\nTag: Do you have a minute?\nRachel: Well yeah, sure, what's up?\nTag: I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.\nRachel: Oh really?!\nTag: Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?\nRachel: Oh, did you not want people to know that?\nTag: But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.\nRachel: Why's that?\nTag: I don't think I should say.\nRachel: Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)\nTag: Okay.\nRachel: 'Kay.\nTag: Well...\nRachel: Yeah.\nTag: I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.\nRachel: (Pause) Yeah, she's gay.", "source": "tv_show_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"instructions": ["Write a summary for the scene."], "outputs": ["Brennan, working hard on her latest novel, is enlisted by Booth to help locate and identify the remains of Charlie, a 6-year-old who went missing from a local park. Brennan determines that Charlie was sexually assaulted before he was murdered, which leads Booth to conclude they're on the hunt for a serial pedophile. When the prime suspect is eliminated, Booth and Brennan pay a heartbreaking visit to Charlie's mother, Margaret, to inform her that Charlie's killer is still on the loose. Suspicion creates uncertainty - among even the people closest to Charlie - and Brennan and Booth must investigate all leads, no matter whom the information points to."], "input": "\"A Boy in a Bush\"\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Fade in: Auditorium. From a podium on stage, Dr. Brennan is giving a lecture to a large group of anthropology students. Behind her shines a slide showing a variety of what look to be skull fragments.]\nBRENNAN: As far back as 1938, the director of the F.B.I., J. Edgar Hoover, wrote to the then curator of the Jeffersonian Institution, Professor Daniel Payne, to aid in the evaluation of specimens who were thought to be irrefutably human. This was the result.\n[She changes the slide, and a drawing of an ape appears. The students laugh.]\nBRENNAN: Despite this early disagreement, the F.B.I. and the Jeffersonian have forged a mutually beneficial, if somewhat tense, relationship which survives to this day. Thank you.\n[The students applaud and Goodman steps to the podium.]\nGOODMAN: Thank you, Dr. Brennan. Are there any questions?\n[A girl in the audience raises her hand.]\nOS: GOODMAN: Yes?\n[She stands.]\nFEMALE STUDENT: How much money have you made from your book?\nBRENNAN: I don't really know. I have an accountant and an agent-\nGOODMAN (cutting her off): That's not really the kind of question we're looking for from an anthropology student.\n[A boy in the hand is called on.]\nOS: GOODMAN: Yes?\n[He stands.]\nMALE STUDENT: Did you get your agent before or after you wrote the book?\n[Brennan moves toward the podium to answer, but Goodman speaks first.]\nGOODMAN: People, Dr. Brennan is an accomplished forensic anthropologist who writes books on the side.\n[In the audience, Booth stands from among the students.]\nBOOTH: I have a question regarding role of the F.B.I. in your book: Who do you base the brilliant and insightful Special Agent Andy Lister on?\nGOODMAN: Oh, for God's sake.\nBOOTH: Because, you know, I'm pretty sure it was me.\nBRENNAN: What are you doing here, Booth?\n[Cut to: Outside the building, Brennan and Booth are walking side-by-side toward the parking lot.]\nBOOTH: Local police got an anonymous call saying that there were human remains in a field behind a mall in the suburbs.\nBRENNAN: I did an anthropological profile of the suburb as a grad student. The whole notion of a created community, a modern utopia with its own mores and rules... It's fascinating.\nBOOTH: Fascinating to who?\nBRENNAN: To \"whom\".\nBOOTH: Whom. (He sees the shiny, silver sports car they've walked up to and laughs) You've got to be kidding.\nBRENNAN: What? My publishers gave it to me.\nBOOTH: Gave it to you?\nBRENNAN: Book sales are pretty good. It's supposed to be a nice car.\nBOOTH: Gave it to you?\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\nBOOTH: Well, why'd you park crooked?\nBRENNAN: Well, the guy said to always park it like that.\nBOOTH: He's wrong. It makes you look like an idiot.\nBRENNAN: How about I drive for once?\nBOOTH: No, I cannot show up at a crime scene in that.\nBRENNAN: Why?\nBOOTH: Because it would detract from the gravity of my F.B.I. presence. Especially if you parked crooked.\nBRENNAN: Why is the F.B.I. involved in the search for human remains behind a suburban mall?\n[Booth pulls a paper out of his jacket and hands it to her.]\nBOOTH: Because this boy is missing.\n[The paper is a missing person flier with a picture of a young boy on it.]\nBRENNAN: Oh... A child.\nBOOTH: Yeah.\n[Cut to: The field behind Clayton Hills Mall. The parking lot is filled with vehicles, among them squad cars and a coroner's van. Booth, Brennan, and Zack are speaking with a police officer.]\nPOLICE OFFICER: Anonymous call came in a couple hours ago. No sign of him yet.\nBOOTH: How do you know it wasn't a prank?\n[The officer starts a recording of the call.]\nGIRL (on cassette player): You have to come right away! There's, like, a dead kid here, all rotted away! It's in the field behind Clayton Hills Mall. You better come!\nBOOTH: Well, that rings true.\nBRENNAN: Why anonymous?\nPOLICE OFFICER: Kids come here to party, misbehave.\nBRENNAN: Adolescents and preadolescents tend to seek out their own space to establish their own society, to counter parental influence.\nPOLICE OFFICER: You mind if I make an observation?\nBRENNAN: No, of course not.\nPOLICE OFFICER: In your book, the cops come off as very one-dimensional. Why is that?\nBRENNAN: You mean two-dimensional.\nZACK: One-dimensionality exists only in theory as a mathematical value.\nPOLICE OFFICER: Okay. Really looking forward to your next book.\n[He exits.]\nBRENNAN: Did you bring the thermal imager?\nZACK: I don't think we need it.\n[Brennan gives him a look.]\nZACK: It makes me look like the Great Gazoo.\nBRENNAN: I don't know what that means, but we definitely need it, Zack.\n[He sighs and walks off.]\n[Cut to: A bit later, in the field. Zack is wearing the thermal imager, which looks like a large orange and yellow helmet over his head. We see Booth and Brennan through his point of view, in yellows, greens, and reds based off of thermal heat.]\nBOOTH: How's it going there, Darth? See anything on Saturn? (off of Brennan's look) Oh, please tell me you've seen at least one Star Wars movie.\nBRENNAN: When I was seven, and leave Zack alone.\n[Back to normal view.]\nZACK: Can we please hurry up? It's stuffy in here.\n[They begin to walk.]\nZACK: I should be able to see any heat residue released from decomposing bodies.\n[They happen upon a small area where there obviously used to be a fire. Some crates and various garbage surround it.]\nOS: BOOTH: Party central.\nBRENNAN: Because suburbs are so homogeneous, adolescents tend to rebel in predictable and uniform ways. Fire, illicit substances, wayward behavior.\nBOOTH: Do you think that wayward behavior would include abducting a six-year-old child?\nBRENNAN: It's pretty extreme. Adolescents are more likely to drink alcohol and listen to culturally inappropriate music at high volume.\nZACK: I'm picking something up.\n[From his POV, we see mostly green as he walks through grass, but then a patch of yellow, signifying some heat, appears.]\n[Back to normal view, Zack takes the imager off of his head.]\nZACK: Oh my God.\nBOOTH: What? Why'd you stop?\nZACK: You can turn on your flashlight. Aim it over there.\n[He pulls back some high grass and we see the mostly decomposed body of a young child.]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[TITLE CREDITS]\n[Fade in: The Jeffersonian Medico-Legal Lab. The child's body is laid out on a table on the raised center platform.]\nBRENNAN: Before proceeding with maceration, any general observations? Zack?\nZACK: Epiphyseal fusion puts the age at approximately six to ten years, though the stature suggest younger.\nBRENNAN: Good. I concur. Cause of death?\nZACK: Blunt trauma to the chest.\n[Brennan walks over to Angela, concerned.]\nBRENNAN: Are you all right?\nANGELA: He's so small. That's all. Go on with your work. I'm okay.\n[Brennan returns to the table.]\nHODGINS: The remains were significantly degraded by insect and animal activity, mostly dog and rodent. Despite the condition of the body, he's been dead between only thirty-six to forty-eight hours.\nBRENNAN (gesturing towards the victim's clothes): These were found a few yards from the body. Notice that they are in perfect condition. What does that tell you?\nZACK: The victim wasn't wearing them when he was killed.\nBRENNAN: Which suggests he was sexually assaulted.\n[Angela approaches the table and hands a sheet of paper to Brennan.]\nANGELA: I'm done.\n[Brennan takes the sketch and walks to a computer screen, where the missing flier is displayed, to compare.]\nBRENNAN: I think we have a match. The clothing matches. It's Charles Gregory Sanders.\n[Cut to: The Sanders house.]\nOS: BOOTH: On behalf of the F.B.I., we're extremely sorry for the loss of your son.\n[Cut to: Inside. Booth is talking with Charles' mother, Margaret Sanders, and one of the Sanders' neighbors, Ellie Nelson.]\nBOOTH: And I have a few questions, I mean, only if you're up to it.\n[Margaret nods.]\nBOOTH: You have two other sons?\nMARGARET: Foster sons. Though I try not to make the distinction.\nELLIE: Shawn and David Cook. They are brothers. I live right next door.\nBOOTH: Charlie was your own?\nMARGARET (voice breaking): Yes. Charlie was mine.\nBOOTH: What about Mr. Sanders?\nMARGARET: We divorced shortly before Charlie was even born. He works overseas.\nELLIE: He doesn't even send child support.\nBOOTH: You mind if I ask how you afford this nice neighborhood?\nMARGARET: Child Services wouldn't allow a single mother to foster if she worked. I live off the proceeds of a generous trust fund my parents set up long ago.\nBOOTH: And the day that Charlie disappeared - all three boys went to the park?\nELLIE: It's two blocks away. It's a very safe neighborhood. They walk farther to school.\nMARGARET: We all keep an eye out for each other around here. People are good neighbors, take an interest.\n[A door opens in the background.]\nOS: SKYLER: Mom?\nMARGARET: In here, Skyler.\n[Skyler Nelson enters with Shawn and David Cook.]\nELLIE: This is my son, Skyler.\nSKYLER: Dad told me to bring the boys back. We gotta go on a job.\nDAVID: There's nothing to do here.\nSHAWN: Our video game's broke.\nMARGARET: Shawn, David, this is Agent Booth. He's gonna find out what happened to Charlie.\nDAVID: How're you gonna figure it out?\nBOOTH: Oh, I'm in the F.B.I. We always figure it out. Boys, I mean, if it's alright with your mother, maybe I could help you out with your video game.\n[Margaret nods, and the boys head off with Booth following behind them.]\n[Cut to: Brennan's office. All the squints are gathered there.]\nGOODMAN: These are invitations to a banquet.\n[He hands an envelope to Brennan.]\nBRENNAN: You called a special meeting to invite us to a party?\nGOODMAN: Don't this of it as an invitation, consider it a summons. It's for donors.\n[He moves to Hodgins, who stands.]\nHODGINS: Meet and greet, press the flesh, butt kiss...\nGOODMAN: I don't like it any more than you do, but these people fund our research, and all they want in return is to rub elbows with a scientist every once in awhile.\n[He walks toward Angela.]\nHODGINS: I can't make it.\nBRENNAN: Yeah, me neither.\nANGELA: I have a date that night.\nGOODMAN (handing her an invitation): You don't even know when it is.\n[Zack raises his hand.]\nGOODMAN (passing him an envelope as well): Yes, Mr. Addy?\nZACK: What kind of food will there be?\nGOODMAN: When I said you should think of this invitation as a summons, I understated. It's a subpoena. A grand-jury subpoena. Ignore it at your own peril.\nBRENNAN: You're not gonna fire us if we don't go.\nGOODMAN: No, not fire you, but I can move your parking spot to Lot M. Enjoy the shuttle ride.\nZACK: The shuttle smells like feet.\nBRENNAN: I know when I'm beat. I'm in.\nANGELA: What the hell, it's a party.\nZACK: Do I have to wear a tie?\nGOODMAN: Formal wear. I've arranged for a limo to pick us up here.\nHODGINS: Not me. I'm not afraid of parking or feet.\nZACK: Wait, you drive me to work. You can't just think of yourself.\nGOODMAN: Repercussions and consequences, Dr. Hodgins. I'm your boss, and you will go to this banquet.\n[Hodgins snaps a rubberband that's around his wrist as Goodman exits, and Angela takes notice.]\n[Cut to: The Sanders house. Booth is helping the kids with their video game.]\nDAVID (as Booth puts a controller back together): Do you know what you're doing?\nBOOTH: Yeah. I can fix anything.\nDAVID: Cool.\nBOOTH: You guys, uh, you guys have girlfriends?\nDAVID: I do.\nSHAWN: Her name's Leila.\nBOOTH: Leila. Leila.\nDAVID: I thought you were gonna ask us questions about Charlie.\nBOOTH: Yeah, so which one of you puny mortals wants to challenge me first?\nSHAWN: Oh, me!\n[They start playing, and Shawn eyes Booth a bit suspiciously.]\n[Cut to: The Jeffersonian, Zack's office.]\nBRENNAN: You about to clean the bones?\nZACK: Yes. I'm warming up the boiler now.\nBRENNAN: Something wrong?\nZACK: These are the smallest remains I've ever worked on.\nBRENNAN: That's a valid observation, Zack, but it's not helpful to the investigation.\nZACK: Sorry, Dr. Brennan.\nBRENNAN: I was at Waco, Branch Davidian compound. I helped identify children who had been killed in the fire. Seventeen of them.\nZACK: So, you're saying I'll get used to it?\nBRENNAN: No, I'm saying you'll never get used to it. We're primates. Social creatures. It's coded into our DNA to protect our young. Even from each other.\nZACK: So, I'm always going to feel terrible?\nBRENNAN: What helps me is to pull back emotionally. Just... put your heart in a box.\nZACK: I am not good with metaphor, Dr. Brennan.\nBRENNAN: Focus on the details.\nZACK: Details. Yeah, I can do that.\n[They walk over to where the bones are laid out on a table.]\nZACK: No trauma to the skull. No compound fractures. Charlie was not beaten to death or dismembered.\nBRENNAN: It helps not to refer to the victim by name.\nZACK: Greenstick fractures on ribs four, five, six, and seven. And the sternum is snapped transversally from the tip to the xiphoid.\nBRENNAN: Okay, what does that indicate?\nZACK: The victim's chest was struck by a heavy, blunt object.\nBRENNAN: Are you completely certain we've learned everything we can from the body at this stage of decomposition?\nZACK: I've been over everything at least three times.\nBRENNAN: Smell the mouth.\n[He does so.]\nBRENNAN: Anything behind the typical smells of decomposition?\nZACK: Some kind of chemical. Chloroform. Something used to render the boy unconscious.\nBRENNAN: Take samples from the mouth, jaw, sinuses, and... what's left of the esophagus. Kids make it harder, Zack.\n[She exits, and he looks down at the body for a moment.]\n[Cut to: Outside the Sanders house, Booth exits with Shawn, David, and Margaret.]\nBOOTH: All right, look, you beat me bad.\nDAVID: No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.\nMARGARET: David!\nBOOTH: It's okay, Mrs. Sanders. It's alright. No, I do have a girlfriend.\nSHAWN: Is she pretty?\nBOOTH: Nah, she's butt ugly. Got a glass eye, snaggly back teeth. So, was Leila with you the day that Charlie disappeared?\nDAVID: Uh, yeah, actually. We stopped and played some video games at the arcade.\nBOOTH: That must've been before you and Charlie went to the park.\nMARGARET: You didn't go to the mall that day, David.\n[She looks at David, who looks away.]\nMARGARET: Shawn?\nDAVID: Don't ask Shawn, mom.\nBOOTH: You met Leila at the mall, didn't you? You left Charlie with Shawn at the park.\nDAVID: Well, just for a few minutes, and then they came back to the mall.\nMARGARET: David!\nDAVID: Shawn let go of his hand for a second, Charlie was gone like that!\n[Across the street, Skyler and his father load up a truck to go off on an extermination job.]\nDAVID: And then we came straight home.\nBOOTH: Charlie wasn't taken from the park, he was snatched from the mall. We've been looking in the wrong place.\nOS: MR. NELSON: Come on, son. Let's go.\n[Cut to: Jeffersonian lab. Hodgins places the victim's jawbone into a plastic box and replaces the lid. Angela approaches.]\nANGELA: What's with the rubber band?\nHODGINS: Methyl oxide vapor in this chamber will bind to whatever compound Charlie breathed in before he was killed.\n[Angela reaches over and snaps the rubber band.]\nHODGINS: Ouch!\nANGELA: It's an anger management technique, right?\nHODGINS: The key there is management, which is what I'm doing. Managing my anger.\n[The box fills with vapor.]\nHODGINS: There'll be a color change. Red for pnictogens and chalcogens, and blue for halogens.\nANGELA: I get that you're a little off-kilter. Mad at the government, conspiracy of dunces, all that. Maybe even furious that you've had to mount a little boy's jawbone inside a box to find out what killed him. What I don't get is why going to a banquet makes you angry.\n[The vapor starts to clear, and the bone glows blue in areas.]\nHODGINS: Halogens it is. I'm gonna scrape off the particles and see if the mass spectrometer can identify what type of halogen.\nANGELA: Anger is only fear, turned inwards.\n[She moves to leave, but stops to snap the rubber band against his wrist one more time. He flinches, and she exits.]\n[Cut to: Angela's office. Brennan, Angela, and Booth are looking at her computer monitor.]\nANGELA: There are twenty surveillance cameras taking stills every two seconds throughout the mall, including access corridors and parking lots. I concentrated on the ones aimed at the public concourse.\nBOOTH: Okay, ten thousand people a day go through that mall. How are we gonna find one small kid?\nBRENNAN: Angela designed a mass recognition program to apply body types to skeletal remains.\nANGELA: Endomorph, ectomorph, mesomorph, that sort of thing. I modified it to scan two dimensional images. In this case, we're looking for body masses roughly congruent with Charlie, Shawn, and David.\n[She points at the screen.]\nANGELA: There's David.\nBOOTH: You're actually one of them.\nANGELA: One of who?\nBOOTH: A squint. I mean, you look normal and you act normal, but you're actually one of them.\nANGELA: This whole mass recognition program was Brennan's idea. I'm completely normal. Really.\nBOOTH: Yeah, maybe before you got this job. But now... BRENNAN (pointing at the screen): I see Charlie.\nBOOTH: Oh. That's him, all right.\nANGELA (whispering): Oh, God.\nBRENNAN: Ange? Are you okay?\nANGELA: It's just... these are probably the last pictures of this little... guy alive. Why is he alone? Why isn't anybody with him? (pause) Sorry. Max resolution is X-40 by 480 pixels per square inch.\nBOOTH: No, wait, he's not alone. Someone's calling him over. Can't you just zoom in?\n[On the screen, we see Charlie walk over to a person, who's obscured by a banner.]\nANGELA: The fewer pixels that make up an image, the more the picture degrades once we zoom in on it. Did that sound too squinty?\nBRENNAN: Any way to enhance it?\nANGELA: Well, I wouldn't bet a date with Colin Farrell on it.\nBRENNAN: I know him. He's funny.\nANGELA: Funny is Will Ferrell, sweetie. Hot is Colin Farrell.\nBOOTH: Now look, wait. The kid was definitely moving toward someone. He wasn't struggling. He wasn't trying to get away. You know, I want to add the neighborhood kid Skyler Nelson to the list of possible suspects.\nANGELA: I have one other angle, but our bad guy is still obstructed in it.\n[They all look at the screen.]\nBOOTH: Who the hell are you?\n[Dissolve to: Jeffersonian hallway. Angela's sitting on a bench. Brennan approaches.]\nBRENNAN: Are you thinking of leaving the Jeffersonian?\nANGELA: I'm not really this person.\n[Brennan sits down.]\nBRENNAN: What person?\nANGELA: I'm not like you. I'm not driven by the need for justice and all that. I'm a good-time girl.\nBRENNAN: We have good times.\nANGELA: Cracking jokes over murdered skeletons is not good times.\nBRENNAN: I know it's harder on you than it is for the rest of us.\nANGELA: No it's not. (pause) Why?\nBRENNAN: Because you look at their faces. We look at everything else. It's more clinical for us. For you - it's personal. When we see a murdered child-\nANGELA: Honey I... I'm, no offense, I'm really not up for one of your 'it takes a village' anthropology lessons. This is the longest I've ever had a job. That's because of you.\nBRENNAN: If this is about hours, or time to do your own art, then-\nANGELA: Just let me work on it, okay? I'm an artist. I used to draw naked guys. Now I draw dead guys.\nBRENNAN: Just don't decide anything without talking to me.\nANGELA: Of course I won't.\n[She leans back and sighs. Brennan leans back as well.]\n[Cut to: Jeffersonian lab. Booth and Brennan walk down the corridor.]\nBRENNAN: I'm afraid Angela might quit.\nBOOTH: I'm amazed she stuck it out this long.\nBRENNAN: Why?\nBOOTH: Oh, because she's human.\n[Brennan gives him look.]\nBOOTH: I'm sorry, Bones, it's just that, you know, uh... Angela didn't get the same training that the rest of you got on, uh, planet Vulcan.\nBRENNAN: I don't know what that means.\n[They enter a room where the skeleton is laid out and Zack is waiting.]\nBOOTH: She's more sensitive.\nZACK: Who's more sensitive?\nBRENNAN: Angela.\nBOOTH: She likes puppies and kitties and ducklings, and, you know, Jell-O shots and, you know, dancing on bars.\n[He makes some music and dances a little.]\nBRENNAN: I know that. She's my best friend. And Angela's not the only person in the world who likes baby animals.\nZACK: I never got the big attraction.\nBOOTH: I rest my case. She's more sensitive.\nZACK: We cross-referenced the length and density of Charlie's leg bones with other children his age. The victim, I mean.\n[Booth stares at the skeleton for a moment, and is obviously emotionally affected by it. Zack notices.]\nZACK: The thing to do is concentrate on the details.\n[There's a pause.]\nBOOTH: Let's do that.\n[He clears his throat.]\nBRENNAN: We found some abnormalities. They're bowed, and abnormally short.\nZACK: Also, the victim's show freezing of the joints at the hip and knee.\nBOOTH: Are you saying Charlie was crippled?\nBRENNAN: The victim was disabled, yes.\nBOOTH: His mother never mentioned that.\nZACK: The ribs are broken in two places, which is not typical of blunt-force trauma.\nBRENNAN: How do you explain that?\nZACK: I'd attribute it to his medical condition and the corresponding brittleness of his bones.\nBRENNAN: I agree. What is that condition?\nZACK: It looks like scoliosis - a bend in the spine.\n[Brennan walks over to the x-rays on the wall.]\nBRENNAN: I think it's more than that, Zack. There are multiple calcified lesions on the posterior thoracic vertebrae. That, plus Charlie's short stature, and the asymmetric length of his legs... Margaret Sanders may not be Charlie's biological mother.\nBOOTH: What?\nBRENNAN (to Zack): Test the bones for X-linked hypophosphatemia and Coffin-Lowry Syndrome.\n[They start to move away, but Booth stops them.]\nBOOTH: Whoa, whoa. Okay, hold on. Simmer down, just back up to the part where she's not his mother.\nZACK: Dr. Brennan is having me check for hereditary genetic defects which are always passed from mother to child.\nBRENNAN: If Charlie had one, then Margaret Sanders is not his mother.\n[Cut to: Interrogation room. Booth and Brennan are questioning Margaret Sanders.]\nMARGARET: How can you say that?\nBRENNAN: Charlie suffered from a hereditary genetic disorder called hypophosphatemia.\nBOOTH: Charlie's real mother would have the same disease.\nBRENNAN: You do not.\nMARGARET: Never say I wasn't Charlie's real mother, because I was.\nBOOTH: Biological mother, then. Mrs. Sanders, you are not Charlie's biological mother. You want to explain that to us?\nMARGARET: I can't have children. That's why my husband left me. So I took in foster kids.\nBRENNAN: Like Shawn and David Cook.\nMARGARET: And Charlie. Though is name was Nathan. I got him as a baby down in Pittsburgh. Ten days old. His mother was arrested on drug charges, and Child Services brought him to me. Three weeks I had him. Then the charges were dropped.\nBOOTH: You kept him?\nMARGARET: No. I gave him back. But it nearly killed me. I stayed in touch. I bought him things - formula, stroller. I wanted to make sure he was all right.\nBOOTH: Nathan what, Mrs. Sanders?\nMARGARET: Nathan Downey. His mother was a drug addict named Janine. Christmas Day I found her dead on her kitchen floor, a needle stuck in her arm. And I could hear Charlie, crying upstairs. So I went up.\nBRENNAN: And you took him home.\nMARGARET: I looked him in the eyes, and I promised him I would never leave him alone again. And he stopped crying. I expected every day for Child Services to come looking.\nBRENNAN: He would've ended up back in the system anyway.\nMARGARET (breaking down, crying): I meant to keep him safe... and love him. And now he's dead.\n[Cut to: Booth's office. Booth enters, Brennan right behind.]\nBOOTH: I had to arrest her.\nBRENNAN: The story checked out. The overdose.\nBOOTH: She confessed to kidnapping.\nBRENNAN: Margaret Sanders did nothing more than respond to the anthropological imperative. She saw an orphan, and reacted.\nBOOTH: This is not a National Geographic study, okay? This is the suburbs.\nBRENNAN: Why would she kill the boy? She obviously loved him.\nBOOTH: There are situations, right? The kid gets sick, he doesn't turn out to be what you wanted. I bet that you could give me a dozen examples of societies that have killed their own young.\nBRENNAN: What about Shawn and David Cook? Where do they go now?\nBOOTH: Back into the system.\nBRENNAN: Do you have any idea how bad the foster care system is?\nBOOTH: Do you? What do you want to do, hmm? Do you want to kidnap them, the way that she kidnapped Charlie?\nBRENNAN: I want you to let them go home to Margaret Sanders.\nBOOTH: It's not gonna happen.\n[Brennan leaves.]\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Cut to: Angela's office. Angela and Zack are bent over the computer.]\nZACK: Try redigitizing and resizing.\nANGELA: I did. The extrapolation protocol got confused by the spread. Hey, you know Hodgins better than anybody else. So why is he so bent out of shape about this banquet?\nZACK: What makes you say that?\nANGELA: Because every time someone mentions it, he starts snapping that rubber band around his wrist.\nZACK: I mean, what makes you think I know Hodgins better than anyone else?\nANGELA: You're roommates.\nZACK: I live above his garage.\nANGELA: But you see a lot of each other.\nZACK: Not really.\nANGELA: He drives you to work.\nZACK: I've never been up to the main house.\nANGELA: The main house?\nZACK: It's at the opposite end of the driveway on the other side of the tennis courts across from pond.\n[Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: Okay, anything on the identity of Charlie's abductor?\nANGELA: I can't clear up this image any more than it is. Tell Booth what you told me about living in Hodgins' garage.\nZACK: There's a bedroom, living room, kitchen, another bedroom, a den, two bathrooms-\nBOOTH: Great. Quite a garage. Can we focus on the case?\nANGELA: How many cars does he have in that garage?\nZACK: Including the antique ones, about twelve. And a boat.\nANGELA: Zack has never seen the main house because the tennis courts and the pond block the view.\nBOOTH: Well, he must be one of those Hodgins.\nZACK: Who are 'those' Hodginses?\nBOOTH: You know, the Cantilever Group Hodgins?\nANGELA: Oh my God.\nZACK: The same Cantilever Group that generates more G.N.P. than Europe?\nANGELA: Get this. They are the single biggest donors to the Jeffersonian Institution.\n[Booth laughs.]\nBOOTH: That makes Hodgins your boss.\nANGELA: What do you guys even talk about when he drives you to work?\nZACK: I mostly sleep. Hodgins mostly yells at the radio.\n[On the computer screen, the abductor leads the child out of a glass door.]\nBOOTH: Okay, if you can't see the guy's face, maybe you can grab a reflection.\nZACK: That's a workable idea.\nBOOTH: Well, I'd say thanks, you know, if you didn't say it like it was some kind of a miracle.\n[Cut to: Brennan's office. She's typing, looking very determined.\n[Hodgins enters.]\nHODGINS: Chem lab mass spectrometer identifies the particulates in Charlie Sanders' mouth as fluoride.\n[He looks at Brennan.]\nHODGINS: I recognize that look.\nBRENNAN: What?\n[He looks at the rolling board of notes.]\nHODGINS: You're writing another book. When you write, you get this stunned look on your face like you stuck a fork in a toaster. Am I in this one too?\nBRENNAN: You weren't in the last one. Fluoride? At what concentration?\nHODGINS: It's too high for toothpaste.\nBRENNAN: Put together a list of -\n[She sees he's not listening and reading the notes. She pushes the board away from him a little.]\nBRENNAN: Put together a list of anything that could conceivably contain fluoride at those levels.\nHODGINS: All right. Do you have time for this?\nBRENNAN: They gave me a car.\nHODGINS: Nice. Who?\nBRENNAN: My publisher. Now I feel like I have to earn it by writing another book.\nHODGINS: Fight coercion in all its forms. You don't write the book, I don't go to the banquet. Solidarity.\n[He leaves, Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: Angela has a face for the abductor.\n[She exits quickly. Booth sneaks a peek at the board of notes before following.]\n[Cut to: Angela's office. Booth, Brennan, and Angela are crowded around the computer.]\nANGELA: I looked on both cameras. This one offered up more reflective surfaces.\nBOOTH: Right at the door.\nANGELA: Check this out.\nBOOTH: The abductor's face.\nANGELA: By polarizing the image, the computer can interpret the spaces between the white and the dark gaps and fill in the missing pieces.\nBOOTH: Wait. That doesn't look like an adult.\nANGELA: When I repolarize the image...\n[The blurry picture becomes clear.]\nBOOTH: Shawn Cook.\nBRENNAN: The victim's foster brother.\n[Cut to: Interrogation room. Shawn Cook draws pictures in some spilled water on the table. Booth is questioning him as a child advocate sits nearby. Brennan and a juvenile prosecutor watch from outside.]\nBOOTH: Where were you taking Charlie, Shawn?\nSHAWN: I brought him to the mall to see David.\nBOOTH: I know you brought him to the mall. But we got a picture of you... leading him out of the mall.\n[He slides a printed image of the picture from Angela's computer screen in front of Shawn.]\nBRENNAN: Have you seen much of this kind of thing?\nPROSECUTOR: I'm a juvenile prosecutor. I wish I could say kids killing kids was rare.\nBOOTH: Where were you taking him, Shawn?\nSHAWN: When can I talk to Margaret?\nBOOTH: After you answer my questions.\nBRENNAN: Can he do that? Lie to a kid?\nPROSECUTOR: We're after a child killer, Dr. Brennan. If the child advocate in there doesn't complain, I sure as hell won't.\nBRENNAN: Well, what's the point of having a child advocate if he doesn't advocate for the child?\nPROSECUTOR: I get the impression that you're a little confused as to what side you're on, Dr. Brennan.\nBOOTH (lifting the hem of his shirt): Shawn, you know what that is?\nSHAWN: A scar?\n[Booth tucks his shirt back in.]\nBOOTH: Yeah. Got it when I was playing soldier with my brother Jared.\nSHAWN: Did it hurt?\nBOOTH: Yeah, it hurt. But it was an accident. You got any scars?\n[Shawn rolls up his sleeve show a few small, round marks on his arm.]\nSHAWN: My dad did it with a cigarette.\nBOOTH: He shouldn't have done that.\n[Shawn slides his sleeve back down.]\nSHAWN: Margaret didn't do anything like that. I love Margaret.\nBOOTH: What I need to know is if Charlie had some kind of an accident.\n[Shawn doesn't answer.]\nBOOTH: Shawn?\nADVOCATE: Maybe we can just take a break.\nBOOTH: Shawn?\nPROSECUTOR: He's not being aggressive enough.\nBRENNAN: Foster kids are powerless. They're treated like garbage. You're in a position to do something about it, and all you have to say is 'He's not being aggressive enough'?\nPROSECUTOR: Dr. Brennan, you know this boy may very well have beaten a child to death with a rock?\n[The prosecutor exits.]\n[Cut to: Lab platform. Hodgins is working, and Angela walks up to him.]\nANGELA: How long have we known each other?\nHODGINS: Do people really ever know each other?\nANGELA: How come you never invited me over to your house?\nHODGINS: Oh, I didn't pick up that kind of vibe off you.\nANGELA: I thought we were close. All of us. What else don't I know? Is Zack from another planet?\nHODGINS: Oh, come on. That one's obvious.\nANGELA: You're rich. You single-handedly own the Cantilever Group. Don't deny, I know.\nHODGINS: Who else knows?\nANGELA: Zack, Booth.\nHODGINS: Don't tell Brennan.\nANGELA: Why don't you want us to know that you're actually our boss?\nHODGINS (harshly): I don't want to be anybody's boss. I never did. Please respect that.\n[Angela leaves, and Brennan enters.]\nBRENNAN: What's up with Angela?\nHODGINS: It's... job pressure.\n[There's a pause.]\nHODGINS: Fluoride at lower concentrations is used in toothpaste, instant tea, and is added to our drinking water. Which, I might add, can cause a range of conditions, brain damage-\nBRENNAN: Which has nothing to do with the case at hand.\n[Hodgins pauses a moment before continuing.]\nHODGINS: The concentrations found on our victim might come from wood preservatives, paint thinners, car wax, or various other industrial products.\n[He hands Brennan a list, and she stick it on her clipboard.]\nBRENNAN: Okay. Did Angela say anything about quitting her job?\nHODGINS: No. But we hardly know anything about each other.\n[Brennan exits.]\n[Cut to: The room where the skeleton is laid out. Brennan is writing notes as Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: Bones, I thought you'd like to know that Shawn and David are in emergency care. Pulled some strings, you know, to make sure they- they get to stay together.\nBRENNAN: That's good, thanks.\nBOOTH: It's the best I could do.\nBRENNAN: Yeah, I understand.\nBOOTH: No, you say you understand, but you don't. Not really. I mean, if you don't like the rule, you ignore it, right?\n[He steps forward and leans on the table.]\nBOOTH: I can't have that. And if you want to do this-\nBRENNAN: Do what?\nBOOTH: Work on cases, you know, with me. Outside the lab. If you wanna do that, I need to know that you will respect the law.\nBRENNAN (voice breaking): Tell you what, if I can't respect the law, I can at least respect you.\nBOOTH (a little surprised): Well- Yeah, that'll work, too. I mean it kind of comes out of nowhere, but-\n[Brennan notices the pencil he broke when he leaned on the table. It now sits in three pieces.]\nBRENNAN: Look what you did.\nBOOTH: It's a pencil. I'll get you a new one.\nBRENNAN: The victim was killed by trauma to the chest, but the ribs are broken in two places, not just one.\nBOOTH: Uh, because of the, uh, brittle bones. Because of his disease.\nBRENNAN: Well, that was my assumption, but there's another explanation.\n[She moves to leave, but he blocks her.]\nBOOTH: Yeah, whoa. What's the other explanation?\nBRENNAN: Compression.\n[She leaves, and he follows.]\nBOOTH: Like Charlie Sanders was crushed to death?\nBRENNAN: Yes. Greenstick fractures. Vertebral and sternal.\n[She holds up the broken pencil.]\nBRENNAN: See?\nBOOTH: Hey, Shawn Cook outweighed Charlie Sanders by, what, thirty pounds? How could he have crushed him to death?\n[They come across Angela as they enter the lab.]\nBRENNAN: Angela, we need to run some scenarios through the Angelator.\n[She walks off, and Booth and Angela move to follow. Hodgins enters from behind.]\nHODGINS: Angela, Booth!\n[They stop.]\nHODGINS: Zack has been informed that if he tells anyone who I am, I will kick him out on the street like a stray dog. Sadly, there is nothing I can threaten you two with.\nANGELA: Yeah, that's a shame.\nHODGINS: What I want out of my life is to come in here and sift through slime and bugs. Unfortunately, my family is one of those who secretly run the world.\nBOOTH: Paranoia and delusions of grandeur all in one package.\n[Booth and Angela start to walk away.]\nHODGINS: You call it paranoia, I call it the family business. Please could you just stop!\n[They do, and turn back.]\nHODGINS: The reason that I do not want to go to that banquet is that the other members of the ruling elite will make a big fuss about seeing me. My secret will be out and my life, this life that I love, will be ruined. I'm asking you, please, please just let me be Jack Hodgins who works in the lab.\n[He exits.]\n[Cut to: Angela's office. Brennan, Booth, and Angela are around the Angelator where an image of Charlie Sanders is showing.]\nANGELA: Charlie was three feet, four inches tall and weighed fifty-eight pounds.\nBRENNAN: And Shawn?\nANGELA: Shawn Cook is 1.4 meters tall and weighs 31 kilograms.\nBOOTH: His brother David was 5'8\", 150 pounds.\nANGELA: 1.75 meters, 68 kilograms.\nBRENNAN: At first, I thought the break to Charlie's sternum was caused by blunt trauma because it only ran along one fault line. But when Booth broke my pencil, I realized there's another way to cause the same type of injury. Compression.\nANGELA: Hodgins found no particulates that suggested crushing.\nBRENNAN: Body weight. There has to be enough weight on the victim to stop the abdomen from moving so no air can get into the lungs.\n[On the Angelator, a pair of legs appears on top of Charlie's horizontal form, and the bones of both people are shown through their bodies.]\nBRENNAN: Prolonged pressure caused the sternum to snap in half and the ribs to break.\n[On the Angelator, the pressure of the body on top of Charlie causes the ribs to snap. Angela is obviously emotionally affected by this visual and turns away slightly. Brennan looks over at her.]\nANGELA: Sorry, sorry. I entered real-world variables, taking into account Charlie's size and the amount of pressure...\n[The visual runs through again, and Angela pauses for a short moment.]\nANGELA: ...that was required to break Charlie's sternum in the way that it was broken.\nBOOTH: What did you end up with?\nANGELA: 86.2 kilograms.\nBOOTH: What's that in American?\nBRENNAN: 190 pounds.\nBOOTH: Yeah.\nANGELA: Way too much for either of the Cook kids or Margaret Sanders.\nBOOTH: I'd put the neighborhood kid Skyler at about 160 pounds.\nBRENNAN: It can't be him either.\nBOOTH: We should be looking for a full-grown man.\nBRENNAN: You have to get Shawn to tell you where he took Charlie when they left the mall.\nBOOTH: He won't talk to me.\nBRENNAN: Let me do it.\nBOOTH: Uh, no. You know, people are not your strong point, Bones. And besides, he's not going to care how many facts you put in front of him.\nBRENNAN: Could you just go with me on this one, Booth? We're trying to catch a killer. Let me help.\nBOOTH: When's the last time you even talked to a kid?\nBRENNAN: I know what to say.\n[Cut to: The interrogation room. Booth and the juvenile prosecutor from before are watching from outside as Brennan talks to Shawn as the child advocate observes.]\nBRENNAN: Do you remember me, Shawn?\nSHAWN: The museum lady. The one who's so smart.\nBRENNAN: Yeah, I'm pretty smart.\nPROSECUTOR: And very modest.\nBOOTH: Oh, believe me, she is being modest.\nBRENNAN: Smart enough to know that you didn't kill Charlie. You don't have to say anything, Shawn. Just listen. They give you a garbage bag to carry all your stuff, like they're telling you everything you own is garbage. And then you have to go to a new school in clothes that smell like garbage bags.\nSHAWN: All the regular kids know you're a foster kid. How do you know what it's like?\nBRENNAN: They bounce you from place to place, and it's never home. Sometimes the foster parents are nice.\nSHAWN: Like Margaret?\nBRENNAN: Yeah. And sometimes they separate you from your brother. It must have been nice with Margaret, staying with David.\nSHAWN (starting to cry): We got bunk beds. At night, I knew David was there. Like he was guarding me. Margaret's nice.\nBRENNAN: You'd do almost anything to stay with Margaret, right?\n[Shawn nods.]\nBRENNAN: The man you took Charlie to, the man who hurt him, he knows that. You didn't know that he'd hurt Charlie, but he did. And then he told you that Margaret would blame you, that she'd hate you. But this man is lying to you, Shawn. I can make sure that you go back to Margaret.\nSHAWN: How? You work at a museum.\nBRENNAN (looking pointedly through the one-way mirror at Booth): I have a friend at the FBI. If I ask him to, he will make sure that you and David get to live with Margaret again.\nADVOCATE: Dr. Brennan, you can't make promises like that.\nBRENNAN: Yes, I can. He will do it. My friend will make it happen.\nBOOTH: Oh, man.\nBRENNAN: But you have to tell me who hurt Charlie.\nBOOTH: I'm gonna need your help to keep the promises she made to that boy.\nPROSECUTOR: Hey, I- I can't promise-\nBOOTH: Mrs. Johnson, my people and your people are gonna have to make this happen.\nSHAWN: What if Margaret doesn't want me anymore? Charlie was her real son.\nBRENNAN: Charlie wasn't her biological son either. Charlie was just like you: someone that Margaret chose to love. I don't think we should let that man take you and David and Charlie away from Margaret, do you?\n[Shawn shakes his head.]\nBRENNAN: We should stop him. You and I should stop him.\n[Shawn sits in silence, crying for a moment, before wrapping Brennan in a hug. He whispers something into her ear.]\nBOOTH: She did it. She got his name.\n[Cut to: The street outside the Sanders house. Booth pulls up as Skyler and his father are loading up their vehicle to go off on a job. Starsailor's 'Some of Us' plays in the background as Booth arrests Mr. Nelson.]\nBOOTH: Edward Nelson, you are under arrest for the sexual assault and murder of Charlie Sanders. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you free of charge...\n[Cut to: Angela's office, the song still playing. She sets the missing poster and her sketch of Charlie side-by-side, and sighs.]\n[Cut to: Lab platform. The song continues as Hodgins takes the jaw bone he had tested and puts it on a tray Zack holds. He looks away as Zack exits.]\n[Cut to: The Sanders house, music still playing. Booth leads Edward Nelson to the FBI vehicle in handcuffs as Brennan watching Mrs. Nelson talk to her son. Both Booth and Brennan watching as Skyler hugs his crying mother. Their eyes meet before Booth exits.]\n[Cut to: The Jeffersonian. Zack, with a shaking hand, places the jawbone in a coffin with the rest of Charlie's skeleton and shuts the lid. Two men in suits somberly take the casket out of the room as Zack watches, emotional.]\n[Cut to: FBI building. Booth enters with Margaret Sanders.]\nMARGARET: Boys.\n[David and Shawn rush up and hug her.]\nDAVID and SHAWN: Mom!\n[Booth and Brennan lock eyes over the hugging family.]\nOS: SHAWN: Are we gonna be a family again?\nOS: MARGARET: Oh, you betcha.\n[Cut to: Brennan's office. The song fades out. Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: We have him cold. The insecticide he was using on the termites matches the fluoride concentration perfectly. Skyler's dad admitted everything.\nBRENNAN: Don't tell me, he said crushing Charlie to death was a mistake.\nBOOTH: He never abused Shawn Cook, he just used him to get near Charlie. It played out just like you said. He had Charlie out in that field. Some teenage kids, they come by, so he knelt on Charlie to keep him from crying out. Shawn got scared and ran back to his brother.\nBRENNAN: Charlie was small and weak. His sternum collapsed. You think he abused any other kids.\nBOOTH: Yeah, probably his own son.\nBRENNAN: You report that to Child Services?\nBOOTH: Mm-hmm. Try to get the kid some help.\n[He pauses.]\nBOOTH: Look, I'm sorry.\nBRENNAN: For what?\nBOOTH: You have personal experience in the system.\n[Brennan pauses for a moment.]\nBRENNAN: I was a foster child until my grandfather got me out.\nBOOTH: Yeah, when you said 'They take you away from your brother,' I kind of had the feeling you weren't talking about David Cook.\nBRENNAN: Booth, I'll tell you all about it one day, but tonight I have to get dressed for a party.\nBOOTH: Oh. Okay, Bones.\n[He moves to leave.]\nBRENNAN: By the way, there's a huge ding in my passenger-side door because you told me not to park it at an angle.\nBOOTH (laughing): What?\nBRENNAN: Okay, that's just mean. You're mean.\nBOOTH (still laughing as he exits): Sorry.\n[Cut to: Lab. Goodman enters, where Angela, Zack, and Hodgins are already standing. With the exception of the latter, they are all dressed in formal attire.]\nGOODMAN: That is not a tuxedo, Dr. Hodgins.\nHODGINS: I am not going, Dr. Goodman.\nGOODMAN: You are going.\n[He sticks a nametag in Hodgins' lab coat pocket.]\nGOODMAN: When we arrive, the donor's will all be wearing nametags.\n[He hands a nametag to Zack.]\nZACK: What do we talk about?\nGOODMAN: Your work, of course.\n[He moves to Angela.]\nANGELA: Zack's work consists of removing flesh from corpses. Hodgins dissects bugs that have been eating people's eyeballs.\nHODGINS: Leave me out of it. I'm not going.\nGOODMAN: And how do you see your job?\nANGELA: I draw death masks.\nGOODMAN: Is that really how you see it?\nANGELA: Don't you?\nGOODMAN: You are the best of us, Miss Montenegro. You discern humanity in the wreck of a ruined human body. You give victims back their faces, their identities. You remind us all of why we're here in the first place. Because we treasure human life.\n[She pauses for a moment before stepping forward and wrapping Dr. Goodman in a hug.]\nGOODMAN: Oh, for God's sake.\n[Brennan enters in a formal dress.]\nBRENNAN: What happened?\nZACK: Apparently all Angela needed was to hear her job description in a deep, African-American tone.\nGOODMAN (scolding): Mr. Addy.\n[Booth enters.]\nBOOTH: Dr. Goodman, we need Hodgins in the lab tonight.\n[He hands an evidence bag of dirt to Hodgins.]\nBOOTH: FBI needs this analyzed by morning.\nHODGINS: Uh, I'll get right on it.\nGOODMAN: Wait a minute, what case file is this?\nBRENNAN: Am I supposed to know about it?\nANGELA: Booth mentioned it to me earlier today.\nBRENNAN: That's good enough for me.\nGOODMAN (conceding): Fine. You're off the hook, Dr. Hodgins. Let's not keep the limo waiting.\n[He leaves, and Angela and Zack exit with him.]\nHODGINS (to Booth): Thanks.\n[Hodgins exits as well, and Starsailor's 'Some of Us' starts playing again.]\nBOOTH: You look nice. Better than nice, you look, uh... very... BRENNAN: Thanks.\nBOOTH: Bones, how did you know I was gonna keep your promise?\nBRENNAN: What promise?\nBOOTH: To get Shawn and David back with Margaret Sanders.\nBRENNAN: Maybe I was lying. To catch the bad guy. I learned that trick from you. The end justifies the means.\n[Booth moves to leave.]\nBRENNAN: Booth.\n[He stops, turns back.]\nBRENNAN: I knew you'd back me up. I knew you wouldn't make me a liar.\nBOOTH: Hmm. How did you know?\nBRENNAN: Because you want to go to heaven.\nBOOTH: But you don't believe in heaven.\nBRENNAN: But you do.\n[They smile at each other, and part ways.]\n[Fade to black.]", "source": "tv_show_summ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

I suspect everything.\nDUCKY: Yes, an admirable trait in an investigator. And also the reason your three marriages ended in divorce.\nGIBBS: Oh yeah? All these years I thought it was because I was a b*st*rd.\nDUCKY: Well, of course, that didn't help. There is evidence of hairline fracture on the frontal lobe of the skull.\nGIBBS: Cause?\nDUCKY: Well, it's consistent with most vehicle accidents, possibly from contact with the steering column.\nGIBBS: What about drugs?\nDUCKY: Well, in this state, a toxicological screen would be useless. However, drugs are a possibility.\nGIBBS: Too many of those, Duck. Too many.\nDUCKY: Well, my current opinion is that Lieutenant McAllister met with a tragic accident.

That was the best part of the song.\nGIBBS: Correction. Your ears are broken. What did the divers find?\nABBY: Actually, it's more like what didn't they find. My theory is they're getting paid by the piece. They recovered everything within a twenty meter radius of the vehicle. Sunglasses, golfballs, Rick James eight-track, typewriter. I didn't see any point in bringing the Maytag up from the evidence lockup.\nGIBBS: Anything to do with the case?\nABBY: As a matter of fact, found directly beneath the vehicle... can you hear me now? I might be able to recover some data from the memory chip.\nGIBBS: What about the bullet we brought up from the wreck last night?\nABBY: Forty five caliber, two hundred and thirty grain hardball. Lots and lots of stopping power. The grooving matches a Colt forty-five, old-school military version.\nGIBBS: Did you work up a trajectory, yet?\nABBY: Of course. The bullet's entry angle into the side of the door is obvious as Anna Nicole's implants.\nGIBBS: Who?\nABBY: You know, married that old guy? Had a TV show? Got fat, got thin, got fat, got thin, fat, thin--\nGIBBS: Stop!\nABBY: So using that angle, I back-traced the trajectory. The bullet traveled on this path. So unless he was driving with his feet from the backseat, which is something that I have tried but do not recommend...\nGIBBS: Abby?\nABBY: The round had to have gone through McAllister's body.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT.

Unfortunately, without leaving any evidence of its passing.\nGIBBS: Hell of a shot.\nDUCKY: Yeah.\nGIBBS: The vehicle had to be going over seventy to end up where we found it in the lake.\nDUCKY: Well, at that speed a bullet passing through the ribcage without so much as glancing a single bone... huh!

Yeah. I figured the Lieutenant headed home that weekend. But the back road that he liked to drive... I think it was washed out. Here, take a look at these weather patterns. I spent nine weeks getting these from the National Weather Service. Every Doppler readout, every satellite image I could find. Pocket of storms, real tight, near the road.\nMCGEE: Enough to swell that creek alongside?\nCOOPER: Yeah, but only on that side of the mountain, kid. My educated guess? I think McAllister doubled back, took this road to the other side where the storm hadn't reached yet. See, the locals only use that road when there are bad storms.\nMCGEE: It's right along Black Lake, Boss.\nCOOPER: I figured if somebody wanted to kill him, they had to know the roads and the weather the way McAllister did. And they'd have to know he was coming.

There's no way he's involved, Gibbs.\nGIBBS: Abs, what do you have?\nKATE: The last three calls that came in on the phone from the lake were all made on Friday, October fourth.\nGIBBS: Yeah?\nKATE: And they were all from his brother, Thomas McAllister.

Pistol, huh? Rifle would go clear through.\nGIBBS: Forty five.\nCOOPER: Ah. Car must have been stopped. He was approached, but not alarmed. Know his attacker? One shot, point blank. Blam. Poor sap never saw it coming. You know how, Gibbs. Want to know why?\n(SFX: ELEVATOR DINGS/DOORS SLIDE OPEN)\nTONY: Ow! Angle your end down, Probie.\nMCGEE: I told you we should have taken the legs off.\nTONY: Ow! Ow! I said down! What does Cooper need this thing for anyway?\nMCGEE: He's old school. It's part of his process. He has solved every case he's taken on, Tony. How many detectives do you know with a hundred percent batting average?\nTONY: You mean besides Gibbs?(SFX: TONY AND MCGEE STRUGGLE TO MOVE THE TABLE)\nTONY: Finally.\nGIBBS: Change of plans. We're doing this upstairs.\n(SFX: ELEVATOR DOORS SLIDE CLOSED)\nMCGEE: Maybe we should take the stairs.\nTONY: Maybe you should take the legs off like I told you to. I'm going to take the stairs.\nMCGEE: I'm the one who said that--\nTONY: Ah! Ah!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY\nCOOPER: Elaine McAllister, the mother. Into the occult in a big way. Psychic, s\u00e9ances, all that weird sh-stuff. She dies in ninety three, the family falls apart.\nGIBBS: How?\nCOOPER: The old man. He took it pretty hard. He decided he was going to contact the dead wife. Starts neglecting the family business.\nGIBBS: What do you mean by make contact?\nCOOPER: He consults this space cadet, Saleena Lockhart. Claimed to be a psychic.\nKATE: I've heard of her. She used to have that tabloid astrology column.\nTONY: I don't buy it.\nKATE: Astrology?\nTONY: No, you reading tabloids.\nCOOPER: She weasels her way into the old man's life. Next thing you know she's practically running it. McAllister Avionics starts to slide until it's almost bankrupt by two thousand.\nGIBBS: How much money did he leave her?\nCOOPER: You're quick, Gibbs. Almost ten million. He changed his will two weeks after the Lieutenant went missing. The surviving brother, still fighting it in court.\nTONY: She's kind of like Anna Nicole.\nCOOPER: Who?\nGIBBS: That's what I said. McGee, run a background on this whack job. I want to know where she is right now.\nMCGEE: On it, boss.\nCOOPER: I know what you're thinking. She didn't do it, Gibbs. This is a smoking gun. Thomas McAllister had a plan to save the family's fortune. He wanted to get out of avionics and into his own airline. And it's a good plan, but it involved leveraging every remaining asset the McAllister's had. The brother didn't agree.\nGIBBS: The Lieutenant was cashing out of the company?\nCOOPER: And going his own way. This is the contract divesting him of all family business.\nGIBBS: How'd you get this?\nCOOPER: You don't want to know. What you want to do is look at the date.\nGIBBS: October fifth, two thousand two.\nCOOPER: The weekend he vanished. Luckily for the little brother, he didn't sign the contract.\nGIBBS: I don't believe in luck.\nCOOPER: Neither do I. So when are you bringing McAllister in?\nGIBBS: I'm not.\nCOOPER: What?! But it's all there! Motive, opportunity, the calls on the Lieutenant's cell phone.\nGIBBS: When you were a cop, did you let civilians lay out your cases? Or did you work them yourself?\nCOOPER: NCIS has had this case for two years. How long am I supposed to wait?\nGIBBS: 'Till I'm done! You are looking for the reward. I am looking for a killer.\nCOOPER: Thomas McAllister is your man, trust me!\nGIBBS: I don't trust anyone either. Kate, how is your rapport with McAllister?\nTONY: She's got more than a rapport, boss.\nGIBBS: Well, good. Call him. You're having dinner with him tonight.\nKATE: What if he says no?\nTONY: The way he was looking at you? I think you're going to be the one saying no.\nGIBBS: McGee, you find my psychic yet?\nMCGEE: I have her business address. It's a TV talk show set in D.C.

Our departed loved ones still have much to teach us.\n(SFX: APPLAUSE)\nTONY: Huh. You think this is how they do it on the Oprah Show?\nGIBBS: Never believe what you see on TV.\nSALEENA: Until next time, I'm Saleena Lockhart.\nSTAGE MANAGER: And cut!\n(SFX: BELL)\nSALEENA: Look and you shall see... spelled S-E-A? What kind of third grader is writing these cue cards!?\nSTAGE MANAGER: Just give us ten minutes and we'll shoot it again.\nSALEENA: I am financing this pilot with my own money. I can't afford another of your ten minutes!\nSALLY PARKER: If anybody needs me, I'll be in craft service.\nSALEENA: Make sure you save some for the rest of the crew. What?!\nASSISTANT: There are two guys here to see you. I tried to stop them. Sorry.\nGIBBS: Special Agents...\nSALEENA: Gibbs and DiNozzo from NCIS. How may I help you?\nGIBBS: You're the psychic. You tell me.\nSALEENA: Brian McAllister. You found his remains in Black Lake.\nTONY: Wow, she's good, Boss.\nGIBBS: It's on the news, DiNozzo.\nSALEENA: I told Brian's father that I felt Brian was in a cold, dark place.\nGIBBS: You can say that. He was murdered.\nSALEENA: Yes. Yes, he told me.\nTONY: Who?\nSALEENA: Brian. We connected through a passage on the other side.\nGIBBS: Passage? That's what you call it?\nSALEENA: You look skeptical. Oh, that's okay. You don't have to believe.\nTONY: So did he tell you who did it?\nSALEENA: It doesn't work that way, Agent DiNozzo. Can I get a green tea, please?\nGIBBS: How does it work?\nSALEENA: Well, I get impressions, feelings. I don't get specific details.\nGIBBS: Do you have any feeling about his father including you in his will?\nSALEENA: I didn't ask him.\nGIBBS: I'm not a psychic, but considering he was a fighter pilot, I'd say he'd be pretty pissed off about it.\nSALEENA: Your point, Agent Gibbs?\nGIBBS: Where were you the weekend Lieutenant McAllister was murdered?\nSALEENA: Luray. Luray Caverns. I was hosting a spiritual retreat.\nTONY: Luray? Hey boss, isn't that about fifteen miles from Black Lake?\nGIBBS: Can you tell me what I'm thinking now, Miss Lockhart?\nSALEENA: I don't have to be a psychic to tell that. Could we discuss this outside please? Your energy is disrupting my set. Thank you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nEXT. SOUND STAGE - DAY\nSALEENA: Look, I had nothing to do with Brian's disappearance. You should talk to his brother.\nGIBBS: Yeah? Why is that?\nSALEENA: Thomas was the black sheep, and he hated Brian. I may be many things, Agent Gibbs, but I am not a murderer.\nGIBBS: But you talk to dead people.\nSALEENA: I have over a dozen people who can verify my whereabouts on that weekend. One of them is a senator.\nTONY: We'll need their names.\nSALEENA: My lawyer will get them to you. Now, is there something else I can do for you?\n(MUSIC OVER ACTION/GIBBS KNOCKS SALEENA TO THE GROUND)\n(SFX: GUNSHOTS)\nGIBBS: You didn't see that one coming, did you?\nTONY: Sonovabitch!\nGIBBS: Did you get a license number?\nTONY: Yeah, I got one.\nGIBBS: That's a good job, Tony.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT.

It's from the same pistol that killed Lieutenant McAllister two years ago.\n(MUSIC UP AND OUT)\nMUSIC IN:\nINT. NCIS HEADQUARTERS - DAY\nTONY: Why don't we just drag McAllister in for questioning, Boss?\nGIBBS: Because his lawyers make more in one hour than you make all week.\nTONY: That's an excellent point. So you're saying I deserve a raise? Or not.\nGIBBS: We need more than circumstantial evidence to take McAllister down.\nTONY: I agree. But what do we get out of Kate going on a date with him?\nGIBBS: I get to search his house for that Colt forty-five without him knowing.\nTONY: And if it turns out he's our murderer?\nGIBBS: That's why you're going with her.\nKATE: I'm meeting him at the airport in twenty minutes, Gibbs.\nGIBBS: Hey, I need you to distract him for at least two hours so we can search his house.\nKATE: Shouldn't be a problem. He already invited me to dinner. (LONG BEAT) So, how do I look?\nTONY: Eh.\nKATE: What do you mean, eh?\nTONY: I mean... yeah. You look fine.

You don't say.\n(DOOR OPENS)\nGIBBS: Let's go.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT. HANGAR - NIGHT\nTHOMAS: I wasn't entirely truthful this afternoon, Kate. When you come from the type of family I did, you get used to keeping secrets.\nKATE: What kind of secrets?\nTHOMAS: My parents were always a bit eccentric. When my mom died, my Dad pretty much lost it.\nKATE: He started talking to dead people?\nTHOMAS: You've been checking up on me.\nKATE: It's my job, Tom.\nTHOMAS: At first I thought it was harmless. But the psychic he was seeing, she started manipulating him, really cutting him off from the rest of the family.\nKATE: Saleena Lockhart.\nTHOMAS: Really checking up on me.\nKATE: What did your brother think of her?\nTHOMAS: He didn't. Brian was too busy with his Naval career. He wasn't around to see the damage she was doing.\nKATE: Somebody tried to kill her today.\nTHOMAS: I thought about it myself more than once.\nKATE: A lot of people think it was you.\nTHOMAS: What do you think, Kate?\nKATE: Well I'm here, aren't I?\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nINT.

He said he'd think about it.\nKATE: Why would you lie to us about it?\nTHOMAS: Because I thought that I was responsible for his death.\nKATE: Were you?\nTHOMAS: When they found his car in Black Lake, I thought he finally decided to listen to me for once. The roads in Hastings are deathtraps in the daytime... at night, when you're tired?\nKATE: You thought it was an accident?\nTHOMAS: Until you told me he was murdered. Only one person stood to gain from his death, Saleena Lockhart.\nKATE: Unfortunately, there is one more.\n(SFX: THOMAS OPENS THE CONTRACT)\nTHOMAS: He never would have signed this.\nTONY: Thomas McAllister.

Two weeks (ON CAMERA) sound about right to you?\nCOOPER: What's this got to do with me?\nGIBBS: The reward was offered for finding the Lieutenant's killer. In order to collect, you had to manufacture one.\nCOOPER: I don't know what the hell you're talking about.\nGIBBS: It might have worked. We would have found that gun eventually. But you just couldn't wait. What are you going to do with the money, Cooper? Hmm? Gambling debts? Retirement? Taking those shots at Saleena Lockhart. That was overkill. Too bad we caught you putting it back.\nCOOPER: Yeah? Good luck proving it.\nGIBBS: Oh, I will. This is an Instant Shooter I.D. Kit. It'll tell me if you fired a gun recently.\nCOOPER: Swab away, Gibbs. There's no gun residue on these hands.\nGIBBS: Oh, a private dick like you... I'll bet you were wearing gloves.

Uh, Terri, I am not a shoe in (as she leaves the room, we see her poster which says \"Ashley Kerwin Your Choice For Degrassi Prez\" with her picture in the center) We won't even know if I'm president till the final vote is counted (closes her door.) Yeah, I just need to have a shower and get dressed. Oh, no, not again. Ter, I've gotta go. All right, I'll see you at school. Bye (hangs up with Terri) (Knocks on the bathroom door- goes back and forth a minute between showing Toby in the bathroom and her outside the door) Toby, out.\nToby: How do you know it's me? It could be your mom, could be my dad.\nAshley: They have their own bathroom.\nToby: Then, go use it. I just got here.\nAshley: Toby, come on, be reasonable. I have to get to school to put up my election posters.\nToby: Aren't you the only one running? (Opens the cabinet and sees Ashley's bra hanging in the shower)\nAshley: Toby, remember what Dr. Fried said? \"A generous attitude makes for a generous family.\" Now, get out the bathroom, now! Toby, what will it take you to open that door?\nToby: Just say \"please\".\nAshley: Please.\nToby: (while fixing his hair) Now say \"Toby Isaacs is the coolest kid at Degrassi.

Yesterday, I left my gym socks on the couch, she freaked.\nJT: Your gym socks can reek something fierce.\nToby: Just 'cause me and dad move in to their house, Ashley treats me like...\nJT: Dirt?

So, ready for Day 1 of the rest of our junior high lives?\nJT: What do you think?\n[Inside Degrassi]\n(Terri is helping Ashley put up her posters.)\nAshley: Dr. Fried says we need to work together and become more like siblings.\nTerri: You fight all the time, you can't stand the sight of each other, you're already acting like siblings.\nAshley: I mean I don't mind his dad Jeff, and I'm glad my mom's happy, but Toby, he's everywhere.

I'm Liberty Van Zandt and I'm running for secretary. We're gonna be a great team. Just think. I'd like to discuss a few ideas so our policies will be in sync. First, I think we should tackle a lack of the school newspaper.\nAshley: Why don't we wait until after the election?\nLiberty: Great. Um, your poster's a little high on the left.\n(She leaves. Jimmy comes up to Ashley and puts his arm around her (which means they're boyfriend/girlfriend))\nJimmy: What was that all about?\n(They walk away.)\n[Classroom]\n(Toby is making copies of something- we see it says JT's name on it, which means it must be posters.)\nMr. S: You do know it's 10 cents a copy?\n(Toby tries to make them stop.)\n[Hallway]\n(Toby's putting up JT's posters.)\nAshley: I'm gonna make so many changes at this school, Terri. And not just superficial stuff. I want the students to feel heard.\n(They stop when they JT's posters.)\nTerri: Uh, Ash....\nAshley: What is that?\nToby: Oh, a poster without your picture on it.\nAshley: JT Yorke. That annoying little friend of yours?\nToby: What's wrong Ashley? Afraid of a little competition?\nAshley: You are so wasting your time. School president is always in 8th grade.\nToby: Well, uh, this year that's going to change.\n(Ashley and Terri walk past Toby.)\nToby: 'Bye, Ashley.\n[Hallway]\n(Someone comes to JT with a camera.)\nBoy: Hey, JT. Why do you wanna run for president?\nJT: Why do I wanna run for president? Uh, that's a good question.\nToby: In one word people: democracy. The backbone of our fine nation.\nJT: Hear, hear!\nToby: He is, people, our great alternative. In a world dominated by cruel selfish 8th graders, JT is our last shining hope.\nJT: I couldn't have said it better myself. Thank you, Degrassi.\n[Outside]\nLiberty: A grade 7 running for president? I wouldn't be caught dead voting for him. Besides, I think Ashley and I, Liberty Van Zandt, will make an excellent team.\n[Another part of school]\nJT: If elected, I, JT Yorke, will do what a real politician would do: absolutely nothing. And, like a true politician, I will accept bribes.\n(Ashley and Terri are watching.)\nAshley: People are actually paying attention to him?\nTerri: He's pretty funny. If you like total amateur humor. You're not actually worried are you?\nAshley: No.\nJT: I, JT Yorke: Unknown, unremarkable...\n[Hallway]\n(Someone with a camera is talking to Emma.)\nEmma: Personally, I think it's great. Grade 7's have just as much right to run for school president as anyone. I'm voting for JT.\n[Outside]\nAshley: Greater representation the school boards.\nTerri: (passing out fliers) And up-to-date recycling programs.\nAshley: I'll even get us a night dance. All it costs is a vote.\n[JT's speech to students.]\nJT: What about the staff washrooms? (It shows Ashley watching) I'll bet you any money that they have softer toilet paper. If you elect me, I'll those staff washrooms, our washrooms. So vote for JT. You'll do the right thing. I know you will. (To Toby) It's working.\nToby: (sees Ashley watching) I know.\nJT: Vote for JT. It'll do you good. You'll love me. Nice to meet you.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\n[Kerwin House: Kitchen]\nAshley: Toby Issacs, you shrimp, who are you doing this to me?\nToby: I'm not doing anything. JT's running for president and I'm just helping him out.\nAshley: JT doesn't care about the school.\nToby: How do you know? Guess what: Degrassi doesn't revolve around you. Anyone can run.\nAshley: The guy is an idiot! And he doesn't know anything because he just got there\nAshley's mom, Kate, walks in.\nKate: Ashley, What's the problem?\nAshley: Great. Take his side again. Don't even try to figure out what we're talking about. I mean, I put all my effort into this race...\nToby: There was no race. Now there is.\nKate: Toby, are you running against Ashley?\nAshley: No, his friend, JT, is.\nToby: I'm helping my best friend run his campaign. What's wrong with that?\nAshley: What's wrong is he's only doing it to bug me.\nKate: Come on, Ashley, I'm sure he's not.\nAshley: But Mom....\nKate: Toby has every right to help run his best friend's campaign.\n[The Next Day- Kerwin Bathroom]\n(Ashley, in curlers, knocks on the door.)\nToby: Today's the big day. Written your defeat speech yet?\nAshley: JT is not going to win.\nToby: You wish. Just think: you're about to lose to a 7th grader.\n(Ashley goes in the bathroom.)\n[Degrassi Hallway]\n(Someone is taping Paige.)\nPaige: Hi. My name's Paige + of course Ashley's going to win today. Sure, some students may resent her for being perfect, but, Ashley always get what she wants, so why would today be any different? Actually, I'll tell why today is different. See, I just got these brand new glasses and I think they look rather nice with my outfit, don't you? Oh, and my belt. Please get a close-up of the belt. Thanks. And my new purse so everyone can see all that I own. What do I have in here? This, this isn't mine.\n(The cameraman starts to walk away.)\nPaige: (O.S.) Hello! I'm not done here!\n[Computer room]\n(Toby and JT are on it, checking polls for president.)\nToby: Look at this! You've got as much support as Ashley!\nJT: It's just some stupid poll.\nToby: This is before your speech (show a close-up of the poll: Ashley- 48%, JT- 52%). Forget Ashley. You're on the verge of making Degrassi history! Am I the only one excited here?\nJT: I thought the plan was to make her sweat.\nToby: Exactly! The closer you come to beating her, the sweater she gets.\nJT: Yeah, well, I'm getting pretty sweaty too. Because if I win this thing, I'll have to do a lot of work.\n[Another part of school]\n(Someone is taping Liberty.)\nLiberty: It would be tragic if Ashley lost today. But if she did, and if I, Liberty Van Zandt, am elected as secretary, I would work closely with JT to ensure excellent standards of student government.\n[Hall]\n(JT closes his locker and starts to head to class when Spinner and Jimmy grab him.)\nJT: Uh, hi.\nSpinner: You're coming with us.\nJT: What? What did I do? I'm going to be late for class, you're going to be late for class. That's a lot of lateness. Do you want to get a dentition? I know I don't. What did I do?\n[A classroom]\nAshley is in there waiting.\nJT: Is this about the election? If I promise you something you got a problem with, just tell me and I'll change it. Really, I will\n(They drop him on the floor.)\nAshley: Thanks. That's all for now.\n(They leave. JT gets up.)\nJT: What's going on?\nAshley: Here's the deal: you quit the race for school president and I give you 50 bucks.\nJT: 50 bucks?\nAshley: 5-0. Okay, 60.\nJT: You see, I'd jump at that but I've got this older brother. He just lost the race for school president.\nAshley: 65.\nJT: My parents were shattered. They had to go on Prozac. I can't put them through that again.\nAshley: 80 bucks and that's my final offer.\nJT: 80's good.\nAshley: Glad to hear it. But for that amount, I want a show. I want you to quit in front of the whole school.\nJT: At assembly? Cool. I still get to say my speech.\nAshley: Half now, the rest after. (Gives him the money)\nJT: It was a pleasure doing business with you, Ms. President. (Puts out his hand but she doesn't shake it) I'll go now.\n(He grabs his bag and leaves.)\n[Hall]\nManny: Once the election's over, I head straight home.\nEmma: And avoid Spinner.\n(Spinner comes up behind them and hits Manny with a spitball.)\nManny: Ow.\n(Holds her neck and starts to cry.)\nEmma: Oh, great. Now look what you've done.\nSpinner: I was just kidding around.\nTerri: Wow that's so cool, Spinner. Making a grade 7 girl cry.\nSpinner: Look, I didn't mean to make her cry.\nEmma: Well, you did. Congratulations.\n(Spinner walks away.)\nEmma: It's ok, Manny. He's gone.\nManny: I knew it would work. Always does on my brother.\n(They walk away.)\n[Hall]\n(Toby catches up to JT.)\nToby: She bribed you?\nJT: She paid me.\nToby: It's wrong.\nJT: Wrong? What about this campaign?\nToby: What about it?\nJT: We did this just to get back at your step-sister.\nToby: She's not my step-sister!\nP.A.: Would all candidates please report to the stage?\nJT: Look, if it makes you feel any better, we'll split it. 50/50.\nToby: I don't want her blood money. It's just helping Ashley get exactly what she wants...again.\n[Assembly]\n(Liberty is finishing her speech.)\nLiberty: And in conclusion, I promise that if elected, I, Liberty Van Zandt, will fulfill my responsibilities as student council secretary with enthusiasm and even more enthusiasm. Thank you. (Applause as she sits)\n(Mr. Raditch comes to the mike.)\nMr. R: Thank you very much, Liberty, for that enthusiasm. Next up, our two candidates for school president. Each will have 3 minutes to deliver their speeches and we will begin with, JT Yorke. (Applause)\n(JT goes to the mike.)\nJT: Ladies and gentleman, it's a long year. You gotta vote for me. You need something to laugh at. Now if I could just say a few words about my presidential platform, this speech would be a whole lot shorter. But, seriously, if there's one thing I've learned in my zero years of political experience, well, it's nothing.\nToby: Ashley! (She ignores him) Ashley!\n(She gets up and goes out the door.)\nAshley: What?\nToby: You bribed JT.\nAshley: No I didn't.\nToby: Yes you did. I saw the money. It's corruption.\nAshley: Oh, how thrilling. You learned a new word.\nToby: Oh you want thrilling? Wait'll I go up on stage and tell everyone what you did.\nAshley: But, JT took the money.\nToby: No, he excepted it as evidence.\nAshley: You wouldn't.\nToby: Oh, I will. I'm heading up there and telling everyone what a fraud Ashley Kerwin is.\nAshley: Fine. My life's a disaster anyway. It might as well get worse.\nToby: Your life's a disaster?\nAshley: I want my mom to be happy and I've tired to be nice, but the moment you moved in, everything become all about you.\nToby: About me? Do you have any idea what's it like living in your house?\nAshley: Please! My mom dotes on you. She doesn't care what I feel, as long as you're happy.\nToby: What?\nAshley: And now I can't get away from you. You're everywhere: at home, at school, even in my campaign.\nToby: That's not true...\nAshley: I wanted just one thing that you couldn't take away from me. But you found a way. Please. Before you go up there and publicly humiliate me, just listen to my speech. Then decided if you don't think I deserve to be President.\n[Inside Assembly]\nJT: She's got the looks, she's got the brains, she's got the brains, she's got everything. Don't pity her; pity me. Thank you. Oh, and by the way, I quit the race for school prez. Vote Ashley. (Sits down)\nMr. R: Well that's rather interesting. JT, you sure? (He nods) Well, I still think we'd like to hear what Ashley has to say. Ashley? Ashley? (To JT.) We'll talk later.\n[Outside Door]\nAshley: Please.\nMr. R (O.S.): Ashley?\n[Kerwin House - Outside]\nAshley: No way!\nJimmy: Yeah, whatever, I'm not lying.\nAshley: Yeah, right. Well, thanks, uh, and I'll see you tomorrow. (They hug)\nJimmy: Congratulations, Ms. President.\n(Jimmy leaves. Ashley walks over to Toby, who is sitting at a table.)\nAshley: So, is this what defeat looks like or just guilt?\nToby: Congratulations, Ashley.\nAshley: Yeah, whatever.\nToby: I mean it. Congratulations. You deserved to win.\nAshley: Ok, what have you done with the real Toby Isaacs?\nToby: it's not my fault JT's in trouble for riding the joke campaign. I should've never put him up to it.\nAshley: You're right. You shouldn't have.\nToby: Ash, I'm trying to apologize here. I knew it would drive you crazy. I just couldn't stop myself.\nAshley: You hate me that much?\nToby: Sometimes.\nAshley: I gotta admit sometimes I feel the same way about you. The fact is Toby, we have to live with each other in the same house and that sucks, right?\nToby: You can say that again.\nAshley: But does it have to such this much?\nToby: Maybe not.\nAshley: Maybe not. Are we bonding here?\nToby: Bonding? Us?\nAshley: Well, the first time in a month, I don't wanna rip your eyes out.\nToby: Wow, Dr. Fried would be so proud.", "source": "tv_show_summ", "evaluation": "LLM"}
