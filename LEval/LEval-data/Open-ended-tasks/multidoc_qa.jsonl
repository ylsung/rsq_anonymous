Under the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program , if you teach full - time for five complete and consecutive academic years in a low - income school or educational service agency, and meet other qualifications , you may be eligible for forgiveness of up to $17,500 on your Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans and your Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans. If you have a Direct Consolidation Loan or a Federal Consolidation Loan , you may be eligible for forgiveness of the outstanding portion of the consolidation loan that repaid an eligible Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan. \n\nWhat are the eligibility requirements? \nYou must not have had an outstanding balance on Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loans as of Oct. 1 , 1998, or on the date that you obtained a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan after Oct. 1 , 1998. You must have been employed as a full - time, highly qualified teacher for five complete and consecutive academic years , and at least one of those years must have been after the 1997 98 academic year. You must have been employed at an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency that serves low - income students a \" low - income school or educational service agency \". The loan for which you are seeking forgiveness must have been made before the end of your five academic years of qualifying teaching service. \n\nTeaching for Less Than a Complete Academic Year \nIf you were unable to complete a full academic year of teaching , that year may still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years if you completed at least one - half of the academic year ; and your employer considers you to have fulfilled your contract requirements for the academic year for the purposes of salary increases, tenure, and retirement ; and you were unable to complete the academic year because you returned to postsecondary education, on at least a half - time basis, in an area of study directly related to the performance of the teaching service described above ; you had a condition covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 FMLA ; or you were called or ordered to active duty status for more than 30 days as a member of a reserve component of the U.S. armed forces. \n\nWho is considered a teacher? \nA teacher is a person who provides direct classroom teaching, or classroom - type teaching in a nonclassroom setting. Special education teachers are considered teachers. \n\nAm I a highly qualified teacher? \nThere are basic requirements that all teachers must meet to be considered highly qualified. There are also additional requirements that you must meet depending on whether you re an elementary or secondary school teacher, and whether you re new to the teaching profession. \n\nBasic Requirements for All Teachers \nTo be a highly qualified teacher , you must have attained at least a bachelor s degree ; received full state certification as a teacher ; and not had certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis. You re considered to have received full state certification even if you received your certification through alternative routes to certification or by passing the state teacher licensing examination. If you re a teacher at a public charter school , you are considered to have received full state certification as a teacher if you meet the requirements set forth in the state's public charter school law. \n\nAdditional Requirements for Elementary School Teachers Who Are New to the Profession \nTo be considered highly qualified as an elementary school teacher who is new to the profession , you must also have demonstrated subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and other areas of the basic elementary school curriculum by passing a rigorous state test. The rigorous state test may be a state - required certification or licensing test or tests in reading, writing, mathematics, and other areas of the basic elementary school curriculum. \n\nAdditional Requirements for Middle or Secondary School Teachers Who Are New to the Profession \nTo be considered highly qualified as a middle or secondary school teacher who is new to the profession , you must also have demonstrated a high level of competency in each of the academic subjects in which you teach. To demonstrate a high level of competency , you may either pass a rigorous state academic subject test in each of the academic subjects in which you teach or successfully complete an academic major, a graduate degree, course work equivalent to an undergraduate academic major, or an advanced certification or credential in each of the academic subjects in which you teach. The rigorous state test may be a state - required certification or licensing test or tests in each of the academic subjects in which you teach. \n\nAdditional Requirements for Elementary, Middle, or Secondary School Teachers Who Are Not New to the Profession \nTo be highly qualified as an elementary, middle, or secondary school teacher who is not new to the profession , you must also meet the applicable requirements for an elementary, middle, or secondary school teacher who is new to the profession or demonstrate competence in all the academic subjects in which you teach based on a high, objective, uniform state standard of evaluation. The uniform state standard of evaluation may involve multiple, objective measures of teacher competency and must be set by the state for both grade - appropriate academic subject matter knowledge and teaching skills ; be aligned with challenging state academic content and student academic achievement standards and developed in consultation with core content specialists, teachers, principals, and school administrators ; provide objective, coherent information about your attainment of core content knowledge in the academic subjects in which you teach ; be applied uniformly to all teachers in the same academic subject and the same grade level throughout the state ; take into consideration, but not be based primarily on, the time you have been teaching in the academic subject ; and be made available to the public upon request. \n\nHow do I know if I m teaching at a low-income school or educational service agency? \nThe school or educational service agency must be listed in the Teacher Cancellation Low Income TCLI Directory, which is published by the U.S. Department of Education ED each year. To find out if your school or educational service agency is classified as low - income , search the directory database for the years you have been employed as a teacher. If the TCLI Directory is not available before May 1 of any year , the previous year s directory may be used for that year. Any questions about the inclusion or omission of a particular school must be directed to the state education agency contact in the state where the school is located and not to ED. State education agencies are responsible for determining which schools or educational service agencies are eligible to be reported to ED for inclusion in the TCLI Directory. If your school or educational service agency is included in the TCLI Directory for at least one year of your teaching service, but is not included during subsequent years , your subsequent years of teaching at the school or educational service agency will still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years of teaching. For example , if you taught at the same school for five complete and consecutive academic years from 2011 12 through 2015 16, but the school was included in the TCLI Directory only for the 2011 12 academic year , your subsequent four academic years of teaching at that school can still be counted toward the required five complete and consecutive academic years. Teaching service performed at an educational service agency may be counted toward the required five years of teaching only if the consecutive five - year period includes qualifying service at an eligible educational service agency performed after the 2007 08 academic year. All elementary and secondary schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Education BIE or operated on Indian reservations by Indian tribal groups under contract with BIE qualify as schools serving low - income students. These schools are qualifying schools for the purposes of this loan forgiveness program, even if they are not listed in the TCLI Directory. \n\nHow much loan forgiveness can I receive? \nThe maximum forgiveness amount is either $17,500 or $5,000, depending on the subject area taught. If you have eligible loans under both the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL Program , $ 17,500 or $5,000 is a combined maximum forgiveness amount for both programs. You may receive up to $17,500 in loan forgiveness if you were a highly qualified full - time mathematics or science teacher who taught students at the secondary school level ; or a highly qualified special education teacher at either the elementary or secondary level whose primary responsibility was to provide special education to children with disabilities , and you taught children with disabilities that corresponded to your area of special education training and demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in the content areas of the curriculum that you taught. If you didn't teach mathematics, science, or special education , you may receive up to $5,000 in loan forgiveness if you were a highly qualified full - time elementary or secondary education teacher. \n\nCan I receive loan forgiveness under both the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program? \nYou can potentially receive forgiveness under both the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, but not for the same period of teaching service. For example , if you complete five consecutive years of qualifying teaching and receive forgiveness of your Direct Loans under the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program , any payments you made on your Direct Loans during that five - year period cannot be counted toward the required 120 monthly payments for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. To receive Public Service Loan Forgiveness , you would need to make 120 more qualifying monthly payments. \n\nTeacher Loan Forgiveness and AmeriCorps Program Benefits \nIf you re an AmeriCorps Program volunteer , a period of teaching that qualifies you for a benefit through the AmeriCorps Program cannot be counted toward the required five consecutive years of teaching for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program. \n\nCan I receive teacher loan forgiveness on my PLUS loans or Federal Perkins Loans? \nPLUS loans for parents and graduate or professional students aren t eligible for this type of forgiveness. Federal Perkins Loans aren t eligible for this type of forgiveness. However , you may be eligible to have all or a portion of your Federal Perkins Loan canceled based on your employment or volunteer service or discharged under certain conditions. \n\nAm I eligible for teacher loan forgiveness if I m in default on a loan? \nIf you re in default on a loan , you are not eligible for forgiveness of that loan unless you have made satisfactory repayment arrangements with the holder of the defaulted loan. \n\nHow and when do I apply for teacher loan forgiveness? \nYou apply for teacher loan forgiveness by submitting a completed Teacher Loan Forgiveness Application to your loan servicer after you have completed the required five consecutive years of qualifying teaching. The chief administrative officer of the school or educational service agency where you performed your qualifying teaching service must complete the certification section. If you are applying for forgiveness of loans that are with different loan servicers , you must submit a separate form to each of them. \n\n\n\n\nIf you withdrew from school and the school didn t make a required return of loan funds to the loan servicer, you might be eligible for a discharge of your federal student loans. \nLearn more about the unpaid refund discharge to see whether you might qualify. If you withdrew from school after receiving a loan made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program or Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program , the school may have been required under federal regulations to return some or all of the loan money to your loan servicer. If the school didn t make a required return of the loan funds after you withdrew , you might be eligible for a discharge of the portion of your loan that the school failed to return. \n\nHow do I apply for unpaid refund discharge? \nIf the school that you attended is still open , you should contact that school and attempt to resolve the issue with the school before applying for an unpaid refund discharge. If the school that you attended has closed , you should first determine if you may be eligible for a closed school discharge instead. Contact your loan servicer for more information. Find out who your loan servicer is by logging in to My Federal Student Aid. If you re ready to apply for the unpaid refund discharge , you must complete the Loan Discharge Application: Unpaid Refund and send the completed form to your loan servicer. \n\nHow much of my loan will be discharged if I m approved for a loan discharge? \nOnly the portion of your loan that your school should have returned will be discharged. Contact your loan servicer for more information. \n\nI m a parent who received a Direct PLUS Loan to help pay for my child s education. Can my loan be discharged due to unpaid refund? \nYes , if your child withdrew from school but the school didn t make a required return of your parent PLUS loan funds , the amount of the loan that the school should have returned will be discharged.

The percentage is different depending on the plan. The chart below shows how payment amounts are determined under each income - driven plan. Depending on your income and family size , you may have no monthly payment at all. * For the IBR Plan , you're considered a new borrower on or after July 1 , 2014, if you had no outstanding balance on a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program loan or Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan on or after July 1 , 2014. Because no new FFEL Program loans have been made since June 30 , 2010, only Direct Loan borrowers can qualify as new borrowers on or after July 1 , 2014. \n\nHow do I estimate my payment amount? \nUse our Loan Simulator. Loan Simulator provides a comparison of estimated monthly payment amounts for all federal student loan repayment plans, including income - driven plans. This comparison is important because the income - driven plans may not provide you with the lowest payment amount based on your individual circumstances. Your payment may be lower under another repayment plan. \n\nHow long will I be in repayment under each plan? \nIncome - driven repayment plans have different repayment periods. Under all four plans , any remaining loan balance is forgiven if your federal student loans aren't fully repaid at the end of the repayment period. For any income - driven repayment plan , periods of economic hardship deferment , periods of repayment under certain other repayment plans , and periods when your required payment is zero will count toward your total repayment period. Whether you will have a balance left to be forgiven at the end of your repayment period depends on a number of factors, such as how quickly your income rises and how large your income is relative to your debt. Because of these factors , you may fully repay your loan before the end of your repayment period. Your loan servicer will track your qualifying monthly payments and years of repayment and will notify you when you are getting close to the point when you would qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance. If you re making payments under an income - driven repayment plan and also working toward loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Program , you may qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance after you've made 10 years of qualifying payments, instead of 20 or 25 years. Qualifying payments for the PSLF Program include payments made under any of the income - driven repayment plans. \n\nAm I eligible for income-driven repayment? \nDefaulted loans are not eligible for repayment under any of the income - driven repayment plans.

To qualify , the payment you would be required to make under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size must be less than what you would pay under the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period. If the amount you would have to pay under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size is more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , you wouldn't benefit from having your monthly payment amount based on your income , so you don't qualify. Generally , you'll meet this requirement if your federal student loan debt is higher than your annual discretionary income or represents a significant portion of your annual income. In addition to meeting the requirement described above , to qualify for the PAYE Plan you must also be a new borrower. This means that you must have had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2007, and you must have received a disbursement of a Direct Loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2011. \n\nICR Plan \nAny borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan. This plan is the only available income - driven repayment option for parent PLUS loan borrowers. Although PLUS loans made to parents can t be repaid under any of the income - driven repayment plans including the ICR Plan , parent borrowers may consolidate their Direct PLUS Loans or Federal PLUS Loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan and then repay the new consolidation loan under the ICR Plan though not under any other income - driven plan. \n\nWill I always pay the same amount each month under an income-driven repayment plan? \nNo. Under all of the income - driven repayment plans , your required monthly payment amount may increase or decrease if your income or family size changes from year to year. Each year you must recertify your income and family size. This means that you must provide your loan servicer with updated income and family size information so that your servicer can recalculate your payment. You must do this even if there has been no change in your income or family size. Your loan servicer will send you a reminder notice when it s time for you to recertify. To recertify , you must submit another income - driven repayment plan application. On the application , you ll be asked to select the reason you re submitting the application. Respond that you are submitting documentation of your income for the annual recertification of your payment amount. Although you re required to recertify your income and family size only once each year, if your income or family size changes significantly before your annual certification date for example, due to loss of employment , you can submit updated information and ask your servicer to recalculate your payment amount at any time. To do this , submit a new application for an income - driven repayment plan. When asked to select the reason for submitting the application , respond that you are submitting documentation early because you want your servicer to recalculate your payment immediately. You re not required to report changes in your financial circumstances before the annual date when you must provide updated income information. You can choose to wait until your loan servicer tells you that you need to provide updated income information at the normally scheduled time. If you choose to wait , your current required monthly payment amount will remain the same until you provide the updated income information. \n\nPAYE and IBR Plans \nUnder these plans , your monthly payment amount will be based on your income and family size when you first begin making payments, and at any time when your income is low enough that your calculated monthly payment amount would be less than the amount you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. If your income ever increases to the point that your calculated monthly payment amount would be more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, you ll remain on the PAYE or IBR plan , but your payment will no longer be based on your income. Instead , your required monthly payment will be the amount you would pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, based on the loan amount you owed when you first began repayment under the PAYE or IBR plan. Even if your income continues to increase , your monthly payment will never be more than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount. During any period when your monthly payment is not based on your income , you still have the option of recertifying your income and family size. If you recertify and your income or family size changes so that your calculated monthly payment would once again be less than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount , your servicer will recalculate your payment and you ll return to making payments that are based on your income. \n\nREPAYE and ICR Plans \nUnder the REPAYE and ICR Plans , your payment is always based on your income and family size, regardless of any changes in your income. This means that if your income increases over time, in some cases your payment may be higher than the amount you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. \n\nWhat will happen if I don t recertify my income and family size by the annual deadline? \nIt s important for you to recertify your income and family size by the specified annual deadline. If you don t recertify your income by the deadline , the consequences vary depending on the plan. Under the REPAYE Plan , if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline , you ll be removed from the REPAYE Plan and placed on an alternative repayment plan. Under this alternative repayment plan , your required monthly payment is not based on your income. Instead , your payment will be the amount necessary to repay your loan in full by the earlier of a 10 years from the date you begin repaying under the alternative repayment plan, or b the ending date of your 20- or 25-year REPAYE Plan repayment period. You may choose to leave the alternative repayment plan and repay under any other repayment plan for which you are eligible. Under the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, or the ICR Plan, if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline , you ll remain on the same income - driven repayment plan , but your monthly payment will no longer be based on your income. Instead , your required monthly payment amount will be the amount you would pay under a Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period, based on the loan amount you owed when you initially entered the income - driven repayment plan. You can return to making payments based on income if you provide your servicer with updated income information, and if your updated income still qualifies you to make payments based on income. In addition to the consequences described above , if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline under the REPAYE, PAYE, and IBR plans , any unpaid interest will be capitalized added to the principal balance of your loans. This will increase the total cost of your loans over time, because you will then pay interest on the increased loan principal balance. Under all of the income - driven repayment plans , if you don t recertify your family size each year , you ll remain on the same repayment plan , but your servicer will assume that you have a family size of one. If your actual family size is larger, but your servicer assumes a family size of one because you didn t recertify your family size , this could result in an increased monthly payment amount or for the PAYE and IBR plans loss of eligibility to make payments based on income. \n\nWhat types of federal student loans can I repay under an income-driven repayment plan? \nThe chart below shows the types of federal student loans that you can repay under each of the income - driven repayment plans. * If a loan type is listed as eligible if consolidated , this means that if you consolidate that loan type into a Direct Consolidation Loan, you can then repay the consolidation loan under the income - driven plan. For example , only Direct Loans can be repaid under the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR plans. However , if you consolidate a FFEL Program Loan or Federal Perkins Loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan , you may then be able to repay the Direct Consolidation Loan under the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR Plan depending on the type of loan that you consolidate. Note that consolidation is not the right choice for all borrowers or all loan types. In particular , you may lose certain loan benefits if you consolidate a Federal Perkins Loan. Find out more about loan consolidation. Only federal student loans can be repaid under the income - driven plans. Private student loans are not eligible. \n\nIs an income-driven repayment plan right for me? \nIncome - driven repayment plans usually lower your federal student loan payments. However , whenever you make lower payments or extend your repayment period , you will likely pay more in interest over time sometimes significantly more. In addition , under current Internal Revenue Service rules , you may be required to pay income tax on any amount that's forgiven if you still have a remaining balance at the end of your repayment period. \n\nHow do I decide which income-driven repayment plan to choose? \nIf you ve decided that an income - driven repayment plan is right for you , you ll want to choose the plan that provides the most benefit to you based on your individual circumstances. Although all four income - driven plans allow you to make a monthly payment based on your income , the plans differ in terms of who qualifies, how much you have to pay each month, the length of the repayment period, and the types of loans that can be repaid under the plan. If you have only Direct Loans , you can choose from all four income - driven repayment plans. If you re not sure which plan to choose , you have the option of requesting the income - driven plan that provides the lowest payment amount. Your servicer will determine which plans you qualify for and will then place you on the plan with the lowest monthly payment. If you have FFEL Program loans , your only income - driven repayment plan option is the IBR Plan. However , if you consolidate your FFEL Program loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan , you ll then have access to the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR plans. Find out more about loan consolidation. \n\nHow do I apply for an income-driven repayment plan? \nBefore you apply for an income - driven repayment plan , contact your loan servicer if you have any questions. Your loan servicer will help you decide whether one of these plans is right for you. To apply , you must submit an application called the Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request. You can submit the application online or on a paper form, which you can get from your loan servicer. The application allows you to select an income - driven repayment plan by name, or to request that your loan servicer determine what income - driven plan or plans you qualify for, and to place you on the income - driven plan with the lowest monthly payment amount. Note: If you have more than one servicer for the loans that you want to repay under an income - driven plan , you must submit a separate request to each servicer. When you apply , you ll be asked to provide income information that will be used to determine your eligibility for the PAYE or IBR plans and to calculate your monthly payment amount under all income - driven repayment plans. This may be either your adjusted gross income AGI or alternative documentation of income. Your AGI will be used if you filed a federal income tax return in the past two years , and your current income isn t significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal income tax return. You can provide your AGI in one of the following ways : Apply using the online Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool in the application to transfer income information from your federal income tax return. Use the paper Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request and provide a paper copy of your most recently filed federal income tax return or IRS tax return transcript. If you haven t filed a federal income tax return in the past two years, or if your current income is significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal income tax return for example, if you lost your job or have experienced a drop in income , alternative documentation of your income will be used to determine your eligibility and calculate your monthly payment amount. You can provide alternative documentation in one of the following ways : If you currently receive taxable income , you must submit a paper Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request with alternative documentation of your income, such as a pay stub. If you currently don t have any income or if you receive only untaxed income , you can indicate that on the online or paper application. In this case , you re not required to supply further documentation of your income. Depending on whether you applied electronically or submitted a paper request form and whether you ve submitted all required documents , it may take your servicer a few weeks to process your request, because they will need to obtain documentation of your income and family size. If you are currently repaying your loans under a different repayment plan , your loan servicer may apply a forbearance to your student loan account while processing your request for an income - driven repayment plan. \n\nWhat other options do I have if I need help repaying my student loans? \nIf an income - driven repayment plan isn t right for you , contact your loan servicer to discuss other repayment options. You may be able to extend your repayment period through the Extended Repayment Plan or through loan consolidation. You may also be able to temporarily suspend repayment through a deferment or forbearance. \n\nWhere can I learn more about the income-driven repayment plans? \nWant more information about the income - driven repayment plans?

Keep reading to see whether you might qualify. Alert! If your PSLF application is denied because some or all of your payments were not made under a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF , you might still be eligible for forgiveness through Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Learn more. The PSLF Program forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full - time for a qualifying employer. PSLF Resources Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Help Tool Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Employment Certification Form Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Application for Forgiveness Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program FAQ \n\nQualifying for PSLF \nTo qualify for PSLF , you must be employed by a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or not - for - profit organization ; work full - time for that agency or organization ; have Direct Loans or consolidate other federal student loans into a Direct Loan ; repay your loans under an income - driven repayment plan; and make 120 qualifying payments. To ensure you re on the right track , you should submit a Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form annually or when you change employers. We ll use the information you provide on the form to let you know if you are making qualifying PSLF payments. This will help you determine if you re on the right track as early as possible. \n\nQualifying Employment \nQualifying employment for the PSLF Program isn t about the specific job that you do for your employer. Instead , it s about who your employer is. Employment with the following types of organizations qualifies for PSLF : Government organizations at any level U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal Not - for - profit organizations that are tax - exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code Serving as a full - time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer also counts as qualifying employment for the PSLF Program. The following types of employers do not qualify for PSLF : Labor unions Partisan political organizations For - profit organizations, including for - profit government contractors Contractors : You must be directly employed by a qualifying employer for your employment to count toward PSLF. If you re employed by an organization that is doing work under a contract with a qualifying employer , it is your employer s status not the status of the organization that your employer has a contract with that determines whether your employment qualifies for PSLF. For example , if you re employed by a for - profit contractor that is doing work for a qualifying employer , your employment does not count toward PSLF. Other types of not - for - profit organizations : If you work for a not - for - profit organization that is not tax - exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, it can still be considered a qualifying employer if it provides certain types of qualifying public services. However , in our experience , few organizations meet these criteria. \n\nFull-time Employment \nFor PSLF , you re generally considered to work full - time if you meet your employer s definition of full - time or work at least 30 hours per week, whichever is greater. If you are employed in more than one qualifying part - time job at the same time , you will be considered full - time if you work a combined average of at least 30 hours per week with your employers. If you are employed by a not - for - profit organization , time spent on religious instruction, worship services, or any form of proselytizing may not be counted toward meeting the full - time employment requirement. \n\nEligible Loans \nAny loan received under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program qualifies for PSLF. Loans from these federal student loan programs don't qualify for PSLF: the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program and the Federal Perkins Loan Perkins Loan Program. However , they may become eligible if you consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Student loans from private lenders do not qualify for PSLF. If you consolidate your loans , only qualifying payments that you make on the new Direct Consolidation Loan can be counted toward the 120 payments required for PSLF. Any payments you made on the loans before you consolidated them don t count. The PSLF Help Tool will tell you whether you need to consolidate some or all of your loans. \n\nQualifying Payments \nA qualifying monthly payment is a payment that you make after Oct. 1 , 2007 ; under a qualifying repayment plan ; for the full amount due as shown on your bill ; no later than 15 days after your due date ; and while you are employed full - time by a qualifying employer. You can make qualifying monthly payments only during periods when you re required to make a payment. Therefore , you can t make a qualifying monthly payment while your loans are in an in-school status, the grace period , a deferment , or a forbearance. If you want to make qualifying payments, but you re in a deferment or forbearance , contact your federal student loan servicer to waive the deferment or forbearance. Your 120 qualifying monthly payments don t need to be consecutive. For example , if you have a period of employment with a nonqualifying employer , you will not lose credit for prior qualifying payments you made. The best way to ensure that you are making on - time, complete payments is to sign up for automatic debit with your loan servicer. \n\nCan I qualify sooner by making higher monthly payments? \nNo. If you make a monthly payment for more than the amount you are required to pay , you should keep in mind that you can receive credit for only one payment per month, no matter how much you pay. You can t qualify for PSLF faster by making larger payments. If you want to pay more than your required monthly payment amount , you should contact your servicer and ask that the extra amount not be applied to cover future payments. Otherwise, you may end up being paid ahead , and you can t receive credit for a qualifying PSLF payment during a month when no payment is due. \n\nWhat if I m in AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps, or my loans are being repaid by the U.S. Department of Defense? \nThere are special rules that allow borrowers who are AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteers to use their Segal Education Award or Peace Corps transition payment to make a single lump - sum payment that may count for up to 12 qualifying PSLF payments. In addition , borrowers who have lump - sum payments made on their behalf under a student loan repayment program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense may also receive credit for more than one qualifying PSLF payment. \n\nQualifying Repayment Plans \nQualifying repayment plans include all of the income - driven repayment IDR plans plans that base your monthly payment on your income. While payments made under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan are qualifying payments , you would have to change to an IDR plan to benefit from PSLF. Under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , your loans will be paid in full once you have made the 120 qualifying PSLF payments and there will be no balance to forgive. Before you change to an IDR plan , however , you should understand that your payment may increase under these plans depending on your income and the amount that you owe. If this is the case for you, and you do not wish to pay this higher amount , then the PSLF Program may not benefit you. The following repayment plans do not qualify for PSLF : Standard Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans Graduated Repayment Plan Extended Repayment Plan Alternative Repayment Plan \n\nPSLF Process \nBecause you have to make 120 qualifying monthly payments , it will take at least 10 years before you can qualify for PSLF. Important : You must be working for a qualifying employer at the time you submit the application for forgiveness and at the time the remaining balance on your loan is forgiven. If you are working toward PSLF , you should complete and submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form often referred to as the ECF annually or when you change employers. If you have made 120 qualifying payments , you should fill out and submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Application for Forgiveness PSLF application. Either way , we ll use the information you provide on the form to let you know if you are making qualifying PSLF payments. This will help you determine if you re on the right track as early as possible. Alert! If you don t periodically submit the Employment Certification Form , then at the time you apply for forgiveness , you will be required to submit an Employment Certification Form for each employer where you worked while making the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. \n\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Help Tool \nThe PSLF Help Tool will help you understand more about the PSLF Program and what you need to do to participate and possibly have your loans forgiven ; help you assess whether your employer qualifies for PSLF ; help you assess whether your loans qualify for PSLF ; help you decide which PSLF form to submit ; and use the information we have about your federal student loans to explain other actions you should or must take if you want to receive PSLF. At this time , the PSLF Help Tool won t allow you or your employer to electronically sign the forms that the tool will generate for you. Therefore , after you complete the PSLF Help Tool process , you will need to print the PDF document that the tool generates, sign it yourself, have your employer sign it, and then submit the form to the PSLF servicer as instructed on the printed PDF document. \n\nEmployment Certification Form Process \nAfter you submit an Employment Certification Form , your loans will transfer to the PSLF servicer. After the PSLF servicer determines how many qualifying payments you made during the period on your Employment Certification Form , you ll receive a letter telling you the number of qualifying payments you have made. The number of qualifying payments you have made will only be updated whenever you submit another Employment Certification Form or PSLF application that documents a new period of qualifying employment. You can find out how many qualifying payments you ve made by logging in to your account with the PSLF servicer and viewing your loan details or by looking on your most recent billing statement. \n\nEmployment Certification \nYour employment can be certified by an official who has access to your employment or service records and is authorized by your employer to certify your employment or your service as an AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer. This will often be someone in the human resources department, though in some cases your direct supervisor or another individual may be authorized to certify your employment. Check with your organization to see who is allowed to certify your Employment Certification Form. \n\nTax on Forgiveness \nAmounts forgiven under the PSLF Program are not considered income by the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore , you will not have to pay federal income tax on the amount of your Direct Loans that is forgiven. \n\nHow to Submit PSLF Forms \nSend the completed form, with your employer s certification, to FedLoan Servicing, the U.S. Department of Education s federal loan servicer for the PSLF Program. You may mail the form to this address : U.S. Department of Education FedLoan Servicing P.O. Box 69184 Harrisburg, PA 17106 - 9184 You may also fax your PSLF application or Employment Certification Form to 717 - 720 - 1628.

When you are responsible for paying the interest on your loans during a deferment , you can either pay the interest as it accrues , or you can allow it to accrue and be capitalized added to your loan principal balance at the end of the deferment period. If you don t pay the interest on your loan and allow it to be capitalized , the total amount you repay over the life of your loan may be higher. Unpaid interest is capitalized only on Direct Loans and FFEL Program loans. Unpaid interest is never capitalized on Perkins Loans. \n\nRequest a Deferment \nMost deferments are not automatic you need to submit a request to your student loan servicer, often on a form.

They can also provide loan forgiveness if your loan is not paid in full after 20 or 25 years. Always contact your student loan servicer immediately if you re having trouble making your student loan payments. If you re seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF or income - driven repayment forgiveness , forbearance will not allow you to make progress toward forgiveness. \n\nBe Aware That Interest Might Accrue During a Forbearance \nIf you are granted a forbearance , you are still responsible for paying the interest that accrues during the forbearance period. \n\nHow It Works \nDuring a forbearance , you can either pay the interest as it accrues , or you can allow it to accrue and be capitalized added to your loan principal balance at the end of the forbearance period. If you don t pay the interest on your loan and allow it to be capitalized , the total amount you repay over the life of your loan may be higher.

Learn more about requirements and how to access request forms. \n\nUnderstand Eligibility for a Forbearance \nThere are two main types of forbearance: general and mandatory. \n\nGeneral Forbearance \nYour loan servicer decides whether to grant a request for a general forbearance. For this reason , a general forbearance is sometimes called a discretionary forbearance. You can request a general forbearance if you are temporarily unable to make your scheduled monthly loan payments for the following reasons : Financial difficulties Medical expenses Change in employment Other reasons acceptable to your loan servicer \n\nLoan Programs Eligible for General Forbearance \nGeneral forbearances are available for Direct Loans, Federal Family Education FFEL Program loans, and Perkins Loans. \n\nDuration of a General Forbearance \nFor loans made under all three programs , a general forbearance may be granted for no more than 12 months at a time. If you re still experiencing a hardship when your current forbearance expires , you may request another general forbearance. However , there is a cumulative limit on general forbearances of three years. For more information , review the General Forbearance Request. \n\nMandatory Forbearance \nIf you meet the eligibility requirements for a mandatory forbearance , your loan servicer is required to grant the forbearance. You may be eligible for a mandatory forbearance in the following circumstances. Note : The mandatory forbearances discussed below apply only to Direct Loans and FFEL Program loans unless otherwise noted. \n\nAmeriCorps \nYou are serving in an AmeriCorps position for which you received a national service award.

Complete the Mandatory Forbearance Request : Student Loan Debt Burden. Note: This mandatory forbearance type applies to Direct Loans, FFEL Program loans, and Perkins Loans. \n\nTeacher Loan Forgiveness \nYou are performing teaching service that would qualify you for teacher loan forgiveness.

What if I miss the deadline for submitting my request? What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer? What should I expect if I request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge? What if I want to change my review option after submitting a form? How do I opt in if I want my legacy claim or appeal to be considered in the modernized system? \n\nWhat s new and relevant evidence? \nIn order to file a Supplemental Claim , you have to add evidence that s both new and relevant. New evidence is information that VA didn t have before the last decision. Relevant evidence is information that could prove or disprove something about your case. VA can t accept a Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence. You can either submit the evidence yourself or identify evidence, like medical records, that you d like VA to get for you. \n\nWhat s Duty to Assist? \nVA s Duty to Assist requires VA to assist you in getting evidence, such as medical records, that s needed to support your case. VA s Duty to Assist applies during your initial claim and if you file a Supplemental Claim. If you request a Higher - Level Review or Board Appeal , Duty to Assist doesn t apply. However , the reviewer or judge will look at whether VA met its Duty to Assist during your initial claim or Supplemental Claim , and if not, they ll have VA correct that error. Your review may take longer if this is needed. \n\nWhat if I miss the deadline for submitting my request? \nSubmitting your request on time will ensure that you receive the maximum benefit if your case is granted. Please check the deadline for each review option and submit your request before that date. If the deadline has passed , you can either : Add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim. Because the deadline has passed , the effective date for benefits will generally be tied to the date VA receives the new request, not the date VA received your initial claim. Send a letter to VA requesting that it revise the decision based on a Clear and Unmistakable Error CUE. CUE is a specific and rare kind of error. To prove CUE , you must show that the correct facts, known at the time, were not before VA or that VA incorrectly applied the law as it existed at the time. It must be undebatable that an error occurred and that this error changed the outcome of your case. Misinterpretation of the facts or a failure by VA to meet its Duty to Assist aren t sufficient reasons. Please seek guidance from a qualified representative, as you can only request CUE once per decision. If you disagree with a Board decision , your decision will have information on additional ways to address errors. \n\nWhat should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer? \nIf you request an informal conference with a senior reviewer on the Higher - Level Review option , they ll call the phone number that you or your representative provided on the Higher - Level Review form to schedule a time to discuss your case with you. The senior reviewer will try to reach you or your representative by phone twice. If no one answers , they ll leave a voice mail. During the call , you and/or your representative can talk about why you think the decision should be changed and identify errors. There won t be transcripts of this call. \n\nWhat should I expect if I request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge? \nYou have the option to request a hearing with a judge.

This is called a copay short for \" copayment \". Whether or not you'll need to pay copays and how much you'll pay depends on your disability rating, income level, military service record, and which of our 8 priority groups we assign you to when you enroll in VA health care. For example , if you have a service - connected condition that we've rated at 50% or more disabling or that we've determined makes you unable to work called unemployable , or if you've received a Medal of Honor , we'll assign you to priority group 1 and you won't pay copays for any types of care, tests, or medications.

This is called an income assessment or financial assessment formerly known as a means test. We re required by law to collect this information. We use your income information to help determine : If you re eligible for VA health care based on your income , and Whether you ll need to pay copays for certain types of care or medications Learn more about applying for VA health care \n\nDo I have to provide this information? \nIf you qualify for VA health care enhanced eligibility status , you won't need to provide your income information. View the requirements for enhanced eligibility status If you don't qualify for enhanced eligibility status, but you agree to pay copays for your care , you don't have to provide your financial information. But if you don't , we may decline your enrollment. We also won't be able to consider your eligibility for free medications or beneficiary travel pay.

Learn more about hazardous exposures \n\nWhat information do I need to provide? \nYou ll need to provide your gross household income for the previous year. So if you re applying for health care in 2019 , you ll need to provide your gross household income for 2018. Your gross household income means the total amount of money you and anyone living with you in your home earned within one calendar year, before taxes. This includes your income from work as well as any other sources, like money you may have taken from a retirement fund or income from the sale of a house. If you have a spouse, partner, or dependent child who also contributes income to your family , you ll need to include this income in your application. \n\nDoes VA verify the information I provide? \nThis depends on your situation. If the information you provide shows that your income falls below our limits and qualifies you for free VA health care, medications, or both , we re required by law to verify the information. We do this by confirming your information with the Internal Revenue Service IRS and the Social Security Administration SSA. View our current income limits Because of tax deadlines , we usually begin this process in July, the year after you report your income. So , for example , if you provide information for the year 2018 , we ll verify it in July of 2019. If the information we receive from the IRS and the SSA shows that you have income above our limits , we ll send a letter notifying you and your spouse or partner if their income is part of your household income. You ll have the chance to dispute formally express your disagreement with this information. You can also send documents showing you have additional deductible expenses that we should consider. If you don't respond to our letter : After 45 days , we ll send you a reminder letter. After 75 days , we ll assume the information from the IRS and the SSA is correct. We ll send you a letter to explain the changes in your eligibility or copay status. We ll also explain how you can appeal our decision. If you respond by disputing the information in our letter : When we receive your response , we ll assign an income verification case manager to work with you and your representative, if you choose to have one. Your case manager will guide you through the process and help you find any authorized deductions that may reduce your total gross household income below our limits. We try to resolve all cases within 75 days. If our review shows that your income is still above our limits , we ll send you a final letter explaining that you ll need to pay copays for future care as well as for any care you received during the year for which we reviewed your income. We ll also explain how to appeal our decision. \n\nOnce I m enrolled, do I need to update my income information every year? \nThis depends on your situation : If you completed a financial assessment to find out if you were eligible for cost - free medications or for beneficiary travel pay but not for free VA health care , you ll need to provide updated income information each year. If we determine you re eligible for free VA health care because your household income is below our income limit , you don t have to provide updated income information each year. We ll receive your income information from the IRS and the SSA each year to confirm that you re still eligible for free VA health care. We ll contact you only if this information changes your eligibility or copay requirements. If you disagree with the information , you can keep using VA health care services while we review your situation. Note: Even when not required , we encourage you to report changes in your income. It's also important to let us know about changes to your personal information like your address, phone number, dependents, or other health insurance.

The doctor won t treat you for any illness or injury, give you referrals to other health care providers, or prescribe medicine. That s because the purpose of the exam is to gather information that will help us make a decision on your claim. Each exam is different, depending on the information we need. During your exam , the doctor may do any or all of these things : Review your claim file with you Ask you questions based on the medical records in your claim file. These may include questions from the Disability Benefits Questionnaire for each service - connected condition you re claiming. Take a look at the Disability Benefits Questionnaires DBQs Perform a basic physical exam Ask you to get other tests like X - rays or blood work if needed If you have any questions about what s happening during your exam , feel free to ask the doctor. But keep in mind that the doctor s job is to examine you, not to make any decisions about your claim. They won t be able to answer questions about the claims process. After your exam , the doctor will write up a report and send it to a VA claims processor to be added to your claim file. Your exam may be very short , or it may last an hour or more. It all depends on the conditions you ve claimed and whether we need more information to make a decision. For example , the required questions the doctor asks about a knee injury may take only a few minutes. But the questions for a more complex illness or injury could take much longer. A mental health evaluation usually lasts 2 to 4 hours. It s important to remember that your in - person visit is only one part of the claim review process. The doctor will also spend time outside the exam carefully reviewing your records. Either a VA doctor or a non - VA doctor who we ve contracted with will do the exam. You can also have your own doctor examine you and fill out the necessary forms. Get instructions for your doctor to fill out VA claim exam forms No. The doctor will give the exam results to our VA claims processors.

This fine is in addition to any other fines, penalties or surcharges that you must pay for a traffic conviction. The purpose of the driver civil penalty is to prevent the repeated behavior of problem drivers and to improve traffic safety. The quickest and easiest way is to pay a driver civil penalty online [2]. \n\nWho must pay? \nYou must pay a driver civil penalty if your driver license or driving privilege was suspended or revoked because you violated the NY State Zero Tolerance Law for drivers under age 21 see Penalties for alcohol or drug related offenses [3 ] or , if your driver license or driving privilege was revoked because you refused to take a chemical test for alcohol or drugs you operated or permitted the operation of a motor vehicle without automobile liability insurance you operated a motor vehicle involved in a traffic crash and the vehicle was not covered by automobile liability insurance \n\nPenalty amount \nThe amount depends on the reason for the suspension or revocation.

That person must have worked long enough under Social Security to qualify for benefits. \n\nHow Your Spouse Earns Social Security Survivors Benefits \nA worker can earn up to four credits each year. In 2019 , for example , your spouse can earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When your spouse has earned $5,440 , they have earned their four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for survivors depends on the worker's age when they die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to the worker's children and the surviving spouse who is caring for the children even if the worker doesn't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if the worker has credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before their death. Each person s situation is different and you need to talk to a Social Security claims representative about your choices. \n\nWhen A Family Member Dies \nWe should be notified as soon as possible when a person dies. However , you cannot report a death or apply for survivors benefits online. If you need to report a death or apply for benefits , call 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 TTY 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. You can speak to a Social Security representative between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. You can also visit your local Social Security office. An appointment is not required , but if you call ahead and schedule one, it may reduce the time you spend waiting to speak to someone. \n\nDoes Social Security pay death benefits? \nA one - time payment of $255 can be paid to the surviving spouse if he or she was living with the deceased; or, if living apart, was receiving certain Social Security benefits on the deceased s record. If there is no surviving spouse , the payment is made to a child who is eligible for benefits on the deceased s record in the month of death. \n\nWhat happens if the deceased received monthly benefits? \nIf the deceased was receiving Social Security benefits , you must return the benefit received for the month of death and any later months. For example , if the person died in July , you must return the benefits paid in August. How you return the benefits depends on how the deceased received benefits : For funds received by direct deposit , contact the bank or other financial institution. Request that any funds received for the month of death or later be returned to Social Security. Benefits received by check must be returned to Social Security as soon as possible. Do not cash any checks received for the month in which the person dies or later. \n\nWho receives benefits? \nCertain family members may be eligible to receive monthly benefits, including : A widow or widower age 60 or older age 50 or older if disabled ; A surviving divorced spouse , under certain circumstances ; A widow or widower at any age who is caring for the deceased s child who is under age 16 or disabled and receiving benefits on their record ; An unmarried child of the deceased who is : Younger than age 18 or up to age 19 if he or she is a full - time student in an elementary or secondary school ; or Age 18 or older with a disability that began before age 22. \n\nAre other family members eligible? \nUnder certain circumstances , the following family members may be eligible : A stepchild, grandchild, step grandchild, or adopted child ; and Parents , age 62 or older , who were dependent on the deceased for at least half of their support. \n\nWidow Or Widower \nIf you are the widow or widower of a person who worked long enough under Social Security , you can : receive full benefits at full retirement age for survivors or reduced benefits as early as age 60. begin receiving benefits as early as age 50 if you are disabled and the disability started before or within seven years of the worker's death. receive survivors benefits at any age , if you have not remarried and you take care of the deceased worker's child who is under age 16 or is disabled and receives benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , your remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. A widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse cannot apply online for survivors benefits. You should contact Social Security at 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 to request an appointment. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call our TTY number at 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. If you wish to apply for disability benefits as a survivor , you can speed up the disability application process if you complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of your appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. \n\nA few other situations: \nIf you already receive benefits as a spouse , your benefit will automatically convert to survivors benefits after we receive the report of death. If you are also eligible for retirement benefits but haven't applied yet , you have an additional option. You can apply for retirement or survivors benefits now and switch to the other higher benefit at a later date. For those already receiving retirement benefits , you can only apply for benefits as a widow or widower if the retirement benefit you receive is less than the benefits you would receive as a survivor. \n\nSurviving Divorced Spouse \nIf you are the divorced spouse of a worker who dies , you could get benefits the same as a widow or widower, provided that your marriage lasted 10 years or more. Benefits paid to you as a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amount for other survivors getting benefits on the worker's record. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , the remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivors benefits. If you are caring for a child under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on the record of your former spouse , you would not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your former spouse's natural or legally adopted child. \n\nMinor Or Disabled Child \nIf you are the unmarried child under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time of a worker who dies , you can be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. And you can get benefits at any age if you were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled. Besides the worker's natural children , their stepchildren, grandchildren, or adopted children may receive benefits under certain circumstances. \n\nFor Your Parents \nIf you are the dependent parent , who is at least age 62 , of a worker who dies , you may be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. You must have been receiving at least half of your support from your working child and you must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your child s record. Generally, you must not have married after your deceased adult child s death ; however, there are some exceptions. Besides being the natural parent , you could also be the stepparent, or the adoptive parent if you became the deceased worker s parent before he or she was age 16. \n\nSurvivors Benefit Amount \nYour survivors benefit amount is based on the earnings of the person who died. The more they paid into Social Security , the higher your benefits would be. The monthly amount you would get is a percentage of the deceased's basic Social Security benefit. It depends on your age and the type of benefit you are eligible to receive. If the person who died was receiving reduced benefits , we base your survivors benefit on that amount. These are examples of the benefits that survivors may receive : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of the deceased worker's benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of the deceased worker's basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower aged 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Dependent parent of the deceased worker, age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death benefit. \n\nMaximum Family Amount \nThere's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount. \n\nOther Things You Need To Know \nThere are limits on how much survivors may earn while they receive benefits. Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If you remarry before you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while you are married. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you will continue to qualify for benefits on your deceased spouse's Social Security record. If you receive benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse , you can switch to your own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes you are eligible for retirement benefits and your retirement rate is higher than your rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If you will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , your Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected. \n\nA Special Lump-Sum Death Payment \nA surviving spouse or child may receive a special lump - sum death payment of $255 if they meet certain requirements. Generally , the lump - sum is paid to the surviving spouse who was living in the same household as the worker when they died. If they were living apart , the surviving spouse can still receive the lump - sum if, during the month the worker died, they : were already receiving benefits on the worker's record or became eligible for benefits upon the worker's death. If there's no eligible surviving spouse , the lump - sum can be paid to the worker's child or children if, during the month the worker died, the child : was already receiving benefits on the worker's record or became eligible for benefits upon the worker's death. If the eligible surviving spouse or child is not currently receiving benefits , they must apply for this payment within two years of the date of death. For more information about this lump - sum payment , contact your local Social Security office or call 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. \n\n\n\n\nOther Things to Consider \nWhat Is The Best Age To Start Your Benefits? The answer is that there is no one \" best age \" for everyone and, ultimately, it is your choice. You should make an informed decision about when to apply for benefits based on your individual and family circumstances. Your monthly benefit amount can differ substantially based on the age when you start receiving benefits. If you decide to start benefits : before your full retirement age , your benefit will be smaller but you will receive it for a longer period of time. at your full retirement age or later , you will receive a larger monthly benefit for a shorter period of time. The amount you receive when you first get benefits sets the base for the amount you will receive for the rest of your life. You may want to consider the following when you make that decision : If you plan to continue working , there are limits on how much you can earn each year between age 62 and full retirement age and still get all your benefits. Depending on the amount of your benefit and your earnings for the year , you may have to give up some of your benefits. If your earnings will be high , you may decide to wait until full retirement age to start your benefits. Once you reach full retirement age , there is no limit on how much you can earn. Reminders : After you reach full retirement age , we recalculate your benefit amount to give you credit for any months in which you did not receive a benefit because of your earnings. When additional earnings appear on your record , we check whether they will increase your monthly benefit. If they do , we will send you a letter telling you your new benefit amount. You can apply for just Medicare at age 65 and start receiving retirement benefits later. When you think about retirement , be sure to plan for the long term. A man who turned 65 in 2014 can expect to live about another 19.3 years. A woman who turned 65 the same year can expect to live about another 21.6 years. And those are just averages. About one out of every four 65-year - olds today will live past age 90. One out of 10 will live past age 95. How long do you expect to live? Did your parents and grandparents all live into their 80s or 90s? If the answer is yes, and you have every reason to believe you will too , you may want to delay starting your benefits until full retirement age or later. If they didn't , you may choose to start receiving retirement benefits earlier. If you come from a long - lived family , you may need the extra money more in later years, particularly if you may outlive pensions or annuities with limits on how long they are paid. If you are not in good health , you may decide to start your benefits earlier. If you stop working , not only will you lose your paycheck , but you may also lose valuable employer provided health insurance. Although there are exceptions , most people will not be covered by Medicare until they reach age 65. Your employer should be able to tell you if you will have retiree health benefits or if you can temporarily extend your health insurance coverage after you retire. Also , if you are married and your spouse is employed , you may be able to switch to their health insurance. \n\nShould I apply for Medicare? \nRemember , Medicare usually starts when you reach age 65. If you decide to delay starting your benefits , be sure to contact Social Security about 3 months before you turn age 65 to check about applying for Medicare. Even if you have health insurance through a current or former employer or as part of yourseverance package , you should still check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. If you need to sign up for Medicare but you do not , your Medicare coverage may be delayed and cost more. Please read the general and special enrollment period information on page 12 of our Medicare booklet to find out what may happen if you delay. If you are eligible on another record , you may have additional options : If you qualify for benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse on another record , you may choose to apply for survivors benefits now and delay your retirement benefit until later. If you delay receiving your retirement benefit until your full retirement age or later , your retirement benefit will be higher. If you were born before January 2 , 1954 and have already reached your full retirement age, and are eligible for a spouse s or divorced - spouse s benefit and your own retirement benefit , you can choose to receive only the spouse s benefit and delay receiving your retirement benefit until a later date. If your birthday is January 2 , 1954 or later , the option to take only one benefit at full retirement age no longer exists. If you file for one benefit , you will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. If you don't need your benefits immediately , you may decide to : Wait beyond full retirement age to receive delayed retirement credits. Reminder: If you are within 4 months of age 65, or older, and you have health insurance through an employer or former employer , you should check to see whether you need to sign up for Medicare. Some health insurance plans change automatically at age 65. Choose early retirement and increase the value of your benefits by investing them instead of spending them. Reminder: If you're receiving early retirement from your employer , keep in mind that some company pensions include a Social Security - equivalent supplement that stops automatically at age 62. The supplement stops because they assume you will apply for your retirement benefits at age 62. If your spouse or minor or disabled children will also qualify for benefits from your record , the value of their benefits, added to your own, may help you decide if taking your benefits sooner is your best choice. If your spouse or ex - spouse s date of birth is January 2 , 1954 or later and they become eligible to receive a higher benefit on your record while receiving retirement benefits , they can no longer delay filing for the additional benefit. If your spouse files for one benefit , they will be effectively filing for all retirement or spousal benefits. However , when you start your retirement benefits also affects the amount your surviving spouse may receive. If you start your benefits : before full retirement age , we cannot pay your surviving spouse the full benefit amount from your record. Generally , if you were receiving reduced benefits , we base the survivors benefit on that amount. after full retirement age , your surviving spouse may receive your full benefit amount plus any accumulated delayed retirement credits. Accidents or unexpected changes in your circumstances can't be ruled out, of course , so your final decision may be based on your \" best guess \" about your future.

In 2019, for example, you earn one credit for every $ 1,360 in wages or self-employment income."], "input": "To qualify for Social Security disability benefits , you must first have worked in jobs covered by Social Security. Then you must have a medical condition that meets Social Security's definition of disability. In general , we pay monthly benefits to people who are unable to work for a year or more because of a disability. Benefits usually continue until you are able to work again on a regular basis. There are also a number of special rules, called \" work incentives, \" that provide continued benefits and health care coverage to help you make the transition back to work. If you are receiving Social Security disability benefits when you reach full retirement age, your disability benefits automatically convert to retirement benefits , but the amount remains the same. \n\nHow Much Work Do You Need? \nIn addition to meeting our definition of disability , you must have worked long enough and recently enough under Social Security to qualify for disability benefits. Social Security work credits are based on your total yearly wages or self - employment income. You can earn up to four credits each year. The amount needed for a work credit changes from year to year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 in wages or self - employment income. When you've earned $5,440 , you've earned your four credits for the year. The number of work credits you need to qualify for disability benefits depends on your age when you become disabled. Generally , you need 40 credits , 20 of which were earned in the last 10 years ending with the year you become disabled. However , younger workers may qualify with fewer credits. For more information on whether you qualify , read our publication ; How You Earn Credits. \n\nWhat We Mean By Disability \nThe definition of disability under Social Security is different than other programs. Social Security pays only for total disability. No benefits are payable for partial disability or for short - term disability. We consider you disabled under Social Security rules if : You cannot do work that you did before ; We decide that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition ; and Your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. This is a strict definition of disability. Social Security program rules assume that working families have access to other resources to provide support during periods of short - term disabilities, including workers' compensation, insurance, savings, and investments. \n\nHow We Decide If You Are Disabled \nIf you have enough work to qualify for disability benefits , we use a step - by - step process involving five questions. They are: \n\n1. Are you working? \nIf you are working in 2019 and your earnings average more than $1,220 a month , you generally cannot be considered disabled. If you are not working , we will send your application to the Disability Determination Services DDS office that will make the decision about your medical condition. The DDS uses Steps 2 - 5 below to make the decision. \n\n2. Is your condition \"severe\"? \nYour condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work such as lifting, standing, walking, sitting, and remembering for at least 12 months. If it does not , we will find that you are not disabled. If your condition does interfere with basic work - related activities , we go to Step 3. \n\n3. Is your condition found in the list of disabling conditions? \nFor each of the major body systems , we maintain a list of medical conditions that we consider so severe that it prevents a person from completing substantial gainful activity. If your condition is not on the list , we have to decide if it is as severe as a medical condition that is on the list. If it is , we will find that you are disabled. If it is not , we then go to Step 4. We have two initiatives designed to expedite our processing of new disability claims : Compassionate Allowances : Certain cases that usually qualify for disability can be allowed as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. Examples include acute leukemia, Lou Gehrig s disease ALS, and pancreatic cancer. Quick Disability Determinations : We use sophisticated computer screening to identify cases with a high probability of allowance. For more information about our disability claims process , visit our Benefits For People With Disabilities website. \n\n4. Can you do the work you did previously? \nAt this step , we decide if your medical impairment prevents you from performing any of your past work. It is doesn t, we ll decide you don t have a qualifying disability. If it does , we proceed to Step 5. \n\n5. Can you do any other type of work? \nIf you can t do the work you did in the past , we look to see if there is other work you could do despite your impairment. We consider your medical conditions and your age, education, past work experience, and any transferable skills you may have. If you can t do other work , we ll decide you are disabled. If you can do other work , we ll decide that you don t have a qualifying disability and your claim will be denied. \n\nSpecial Situations \nMost people who receive disability benefits are workers who qualify on their own records and meet the work and disability requirements we have just described. However , there are some situations you may not know about : If You're Blind Or Have Low Vision - How We Can Help If You Are The Worker's Widow Or Widower Benefits For A Disabled Child Benefits for Wounded Warriors & Veterans \n\nSpecial Rules For People Who Are Blind Or Have Low Vision \nWe consider you to be legally blind under Social Security rules if your vision cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in your better eye or if your visual field is 20 degrees or less, even with a corrective lens. Many people who meet the legal definition of blindness still have some sight and may be able to read large print and get around without a cane or a guide dog. If you do not meet the legal definition of blindness , you may still qualify for disability benefits if your vision problems alone or combined with other health problems prevent you from working. There are a number of special rules for people who are blind that recognize the severe impact of blindness on a person's ability to work. For example , the monthly earnings limit for people who are blind is generally higher than the limit that applies to non - blind disabled workers. In 2019 , the monthly earnings limit is $2,040. \n\nBenefits For Disabled Widows Or Widowers \nIf something happens to a worker , benefits may be payable to their widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse with a disability if the following conditions are met : He or she is between ages 50 and 60 ; Their condition meets the definition of disability for adults ; and The disability started before or within seven years of the worker's death. Widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses cannot apply online for survivors benefits. However , if they want to apply for benefits , they should contact Social Security immediatelyat to request an appointment. (If they are deaf or hard of hearing, they should call our TTY number at If they are disabled , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment. We use the same definition of disability for widows and widowers as we do for workers. \n\nBenefits For A Disabled Child \nA child under age 18 may be disabled , but we don't need to consider the child's disability when deciding if he or she qualifies for benefits as your dependent. The child's benefits normally stop at age 18 unless he or she is a full - time student in an elementary or high school benefits can continue until age 19 or is disabled. \n\nAdults Disabled Before Age 22 \nAn adult disabled before age 22 may be eligible for child's benefits if a parent is deceased or starts receiving retirement or disability benefits. We consider this a \" child's \" benefit because it is paid on a parent's Social Security earnings record. The \" adult child \" including an adopted child, or, in some cases, a stepchild, grandchild, or step grandchild must be unmarried, age 18 or older, have a disability that started before age 22, and meet the definition of disability for adults. It is not necessary that the adult child ever worked. Benefits are paid based on the parent's earnings record. An adult child must not have substantial earnings. The amount of earnings we consider \" substantial \" increases each year. In 2019 , this means working and earning more than $1,220 a month. \n\nWhat if the adult child is already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record? \nAn adult child already receiving SSI benefits or disability benefits on his or her own record should still check to see if benefits may be payable on a parent's earnings record. Higher benefits might be payable and entitlement to Medicare may be possible. \n\nHow do we decide if an adult \"child\" is disabled for SSDI benefits? \nIf a child is age 18 or older , we will evaluate his or her disability the same way we would evaluate the disability for any adult. We send the application to the Disability Determination Services in your state that completes the disability decision for us. \n\nWhat happens if the adult child gets married? \nIf he or she receives benefits as an adult disabled since childhood , the benefits generally end if he or she gets married. However , some marriages for example, to another adult disabled child are considered protected. The rules vary depending on the situation. Contact a Social Security representative at (If you are deaf or hard of hearing, call TTY number at to find out if the benefits can continue. If they are disabled , they can speed up the application process if they complete an Adult Disability Report and have it available at the time of their appointment. \n\nRelated Information \nApply For Disability Benefits Child Under Age 18 Family Benefits \n\nPublications \nDisability Benefits Disability Starter Kits If You Are Blind Or Have Low Vision How We Can Help SSI Child Disability Starter Kit for children under age 18 Benefits For Children With Disabilities Other Disability Publications \n\n\n\n\nBenefits Planner: Retirement \n\n\nBenefits For Your Family \nWhen you start receiving Social Security retirement benefits , some members of your family may also qualify to receive benefits on your record. If they qualify , your spouse or child may receive a monthly payment of up to one - half of your full retirement benefit amount. These payments will not decrease your retirement benefit. In fact , the value of the benefits your family may receive, added to your own, may help you decide if taking your benefits sooner may be more advantageous. Benefits paid to your spouse will not decrease your retirement benefit. In fact , the value of the benefits they may receive, added to your own, may help you decide if taking your benefits sooner may be more advantageous. \n\nMaximum Family Benefits \nIf one of your children also qualifies for benefits , there is a limit to the amount we can pay your family. The total depends on your benefit amount and the number of family members who also qualify on your record. The total varies , but generally the total amount you and your family can receive is about 150 to 180 percent of your full retirement benefit. If any of your qualified family members apply for benefits with you , we will ask you for their Social Security numbers and their birth certificates. \n\nBenefits For Your Spouse \nEven if they have never worked under Social Security , your spouse may be able to get benefits if they are at least 62 years of age and you are receiving or eligible for retirement or disability benefits. Your spouse can also qualify for Medicare at age 65. \n\nHow Much Will My Spouse Receive? \nIf your spouse qualifies for benefits on their own record , we will pay that amount first. If the benefit on your record is higher , they will get an additional amount on your record so that the combination of benefits equals that higher amount. If they begin receiving benefits : between age 62 and their full retirement age , the amount will be permanently reduced by a percentage based on the number of months up to their full retirement age. If your spouse is under full retirement age and : works while receiving benefits , their benefits may be affected by the retirement earnings test. also qualifies on their own record , their application will include both benefits. at their full retirement age , the spouse s benefit cannot exceed one - half of your full retirement amount. \n\n\n\n\nYou Can Apply For Retirement Benefits Or Medicare \nApply Online The easiest and quickest way to apply for retirement, spouse's, ex - spouse's, or Medicare benefits is to apply online.

Most people don t pay higher premiums. \n\nIf You Have a Higher Income \nIf you have higher income , you ll pay an additional premium amount for Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. We call the additional amount the income - related monthly adjustment amount. Here s how it works : Part B helps pay for your doctors services and outpatient care. It also covers other medical services, such as physical and occupational therapy, and some home health care. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a substantial portion about 75 percent of the Part B premium , and the beneficiary pays the remaining 25 percent. If we determine you re a higher - income beneficiary , you ll pay a larger percentage of the total cost of Part B based on the income you normally report to the Internal Revenue Service IRS. You ll pay monthly Part B premiums equal to 35 , 50 , 65 , 80, or 85 percent of the total cost, depending on what you report to the IRS. Medicare prescription drug coverage helps pay for your prescription drugs. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a major portion of the total costs for this coverage , and the beneficiary pays the rest. Prescription drug plan costs vary depending on the plan, and whether you get the Extra Help, also known as the subsidy, with your portion of the Medicare prescription drug coverage costs. If you re a higher - income beneficiary with Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay monthly premiums plus an additional amount, which is based on what you report to the IRS. Because individual plan premiums vary , the law specifies that the amount is determined using a base premium. We tie the additional amount you pay to the base beneficiary premium, not your own premium amount. If you re a higher - income beneficiary , we deduct this amount from your monthly Social Security payments regardless of how you usually pay your monthly prescription plan premiums. If the amount is greater than your monthly payment from Social Security, or you don t get monthly payments , you ll get a separate bill from another federal agency, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Railroad Retirement Board. \n\nHow Social Security Determines You Have a Higher Premium \nSocial Security uses the most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. If you must pay higher premiums , we use a sliding scale to calculate the adjustments, based on your modified adjusted gross income MAGI. Your MAGI is your total adjusted gross income and tax - exempt interest income. If you file your taxes as married, filing jointly and your MAGI is greater than $170,000 , you ll pay higher premiums for your Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. If you file your taxes using a different status, and your MAGI is greater than $85,000 , you ll pay higher premiums. See the chart below, Modified Adjusted Gross Income MAGI, for an idea of what you can expect to pay. If you must pay higher premiums , we ll send you a letter with your premium amount and the reason for our determination. If you have both Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay higher premiums for each. If you have only one Medicare Part B or Medicare prescription drug coverage you ll pay an income - related monthly adjustment amount only on the benefit you have. If you decide to enroll in the other program later in the same year, and you already are paying an income - related monthly adjustment amount , we ll apply an adjustment automatically to the other program when you enroll. In this case , we won t send you another letter explaining how we made this determination. Remember , if your income isn t greater than the limits described above , this law does not apply to you. \n\nYour Tax Return \nTo determine your 2020 income - related monthly adjustment amounts , we use your most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. Generally , this information is from a tax return filed in 2019 for tax year 2018. Sometimes , the IRS only provides information from a return filed in 2018 for tax year 2017. If we use the 2017 tax year data , and you filed a return for tax year 2018 or did not need to file a tax return for tax year 2018 , call us or visit any local Social Security office. We ll update our records. If you amended your tax return , we count and it changes the income to determine the income - related monthly adjustment amounts your MAGI , let us know. Social Security needs to see a copy of the amended tax return you filed and your acknowledgment receipt from IRS. We ll update our records with the information you provide, and correct or remove your income - related monthly adjustment amounts, as appropriate. \n\nIf Your Income Has Gone Down \nIf your income has gone down due to any of the following situations, and the change makes a difference in the income level we consider , contact us to explain that you have new information and may need a new decision about your income - related monthly adjustment amount : You married, divorced, or became widowed. You or your spouse stopped working or reduced your work hours. You or your spouse lost income - producing property because of a disaster or other event beyond your control. You or your spouse experienced a scheduled cessation, termination, or reorganization of an employer s pension plan. You or your spouse received a settlement from an employer or former employer because of the employer s closure, bankruptcy, or reorganization. If any of the above applies to you , we need to see documentation verifying the event and the reduction in your income. The documentation you provide should relate to the event and may include a death certificate, a letter from your employer about your retirement, or something similar. If you filed a federal income tax return for the year in question , you need to show us your signed copy of the return.

It also covers other medical services, such as physical and occupational therapy, and some home health care. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a substantial portion about 75 percent of the Part B premium , and the beneficiary pays the remaining 25 percent. If we determine you re a higher - income beneficiary , you ll pay a larger percentage of the total cost of Part B based on the income you normally report to the Internal Revenue Service IRS. You ll pay monthly Part B premiums equal to 35 , 50 , 65 , 80, or 85 percent of the total cost, depending on what you report to the IRS. Medicare prescription drug coverage helps pay for your prescription drugs. For most beneficiaries , the government pays a major portion of the total costs for this coverage , and the beneficiary pays the rest. Prescription drug plan costs vary depending on the plan, and whether you get the Extra Help, also known as the subsidy, with your portion of the Medicare prescription drug coverage costs. If you re a higher - income beneficiary with Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay monthly premiums plus an additional amount, which is based on what you report to the IRS. Because individual plan premiums vary , the law specifies that the amount is determined using a base premium. We tie the additional amount you pay to the base beneficiary premium, not your own premium amount. If you re a higher - income beneficiary , we deduct this amount from your monthly Social Security payments regardless of how you usually pay your monthly prescription plan premiums. If the amount is greater than your monthly payment from Social Security, or you don t get monthly payments , you ll get a separate bill from another federal agency, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Railroad Retirement Board. \n\nHow Social Security Determines You Have a Higher Premium \nSocial Security uses the most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. If you must pay higher premiums , we use a sliding scale to calculate the adjustments, based on your modified adjusted gross income MAGI. Your MAGI is your total adjusted gross income and tax - exempt interest income. If you file your taxes as married, filing jointly and your MAGI is greater than $170,000 , you ll pay higher premiums for your Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage. If you file your taxes using a different status, and your MAGI is greater than $85,000 , you ll pay higher premiums. See the chart below, Modified Adjusted Gross Income MAGI, for an idea of what you can expect to pay. If you must pay higher premiums , we ll send you a letter with your premium amount and the reason for our determination. If you have both Medicare Part B and Medicare prescription drug coverage , you ll pay higher premiums for each. If you have only one Medicare Part B or Medicare prescription drug coverage you ll pay an income - related monthly adjustment amount only on the benefit you have. If you decide to enroll in the other program later in the same year, and you already are paying an income - related monthly adjustment amount , we ll apply an adjustment automatically to the other program when you enroll. In this case , we won t send you another letter explaining how we made this determination. Remember , if your income isn t greater than the limits described above , this law does not apply to you. \n\nYour Tax Return \nTo determine your 2020 income - related monthly adjustment amounts , we use your most recent federal tax return the IRS provides to us. Generally , this information is from a tax return filed in 2019 for tax year 2018. Sometimes , the IRS only provides information from a return filed in 2018 for tax year 2017. If we use the 2017 tax year data , and you filed a return for tax year 2018 or did not need to file a tax return for tax year 2018 , call us or visit any local Social Security office. We ll update our records. If you amended your tax return , we count and it changes the income to determine the income - related monthly adjustment amounts your MAGI , let us know. Social Security needs to see a copy of the amended tax return you filed and your acknowledgment receipt from IRS. We ll update our records with the information you provide, and correct or remove your income - related monthly adjustment amounts, as appropriate. \n\nIf Your Income Has Gone Down \nIf your income has gone down due to any of the following situations, and the change makes a difference in the income level we consider , contact us to explain that you have new information and may need a new decision about your income - related monthly adjustment amount : You married, divorced, or became widowed. You or your spouse stopped working or reduced your work hours. You or your spouse lost income - producing property because of a disaster or other event beyond your control. You or your spouse experienced a scheduled cessation, termination, or reorganization of an employer s pension plan. You or your spouse received a settlement from an employer or former employer because of the employer s closure, bankruptcy, or reorganization. If any of the above applies to you , we need to see documentation verifying the event and the reduction in your income. The documentation you provide should relate to the event and may include a death certificate, a letter from your employer about your retirement, or something similar. If you filed a federal income tax return for the year in question , you need to show us your signed copy of the return. Use Form Medicare Income - Related Monthly Adjustment Amount Life - Changing Event to report a major life - changing event. If your income has gone down , you may also use Form SSA-44 to request a reduction in your income - related monthly adjustment amount. You can find Form SSA-44. \n\nMonthly Medicare premiums for 2020 \nThe standard Part B premium for 2020 is $144.60. If you re single and filed an individual tax return, or married and filed a joint tax return , the following chart applies to you : If you re married and lived with your spouse at some time during the taxable year, but filed a separate tax return , the following chart applies to you : \n\nIf You Disagree With Our Decision \nIf you disagree with the decision we made about your income - related monthly adjustment amounts , you have the right to appeal. The fastest and easiest way to file an appeal of your decision is online. You can file online and provide documents electronically to support your appeal. You can file an appeal online even if you live outside of the United States. You may also request an appeal in writing by completing a Request for Reconsideration Form SSA-561-U2 , or you may contact your local Social Security office to file your appeal. You can use the appeal form online, or request a copy through our toll - free number at 1 - 800 - 772 - 1213 TTY 1 - 800 - 325 - 0778. You don t need to file an appeal if you re requesting a new decision because you experienced one of the events listed and, it made your income go down, or if you ve shown us the information we used is wrong. If you disagree with the MAGI amount we received from the IRS , you must correct the information with the IRS. If we determine you must pay a higher amount for Medicare prescription drug coverage , and you don t have this coverage , you must call the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services CMS at 1 - 800-MEDICARE 1 - 800 - 633 - 4227; TTY 1 - 877 - 486 - 2048 to make a correction.

The portion of your pre - retirement wages that Social Security replaces is based on your highest 35 years of earnings and varies depending on how much you earn and when you choose to start benefits. The Social Security system works like this : when you work, you pay taxes into Social Security. We use the tax money to pay benefits to : People who have already retired. People who are disabled. Survivors of workers who have died. Dependents of beneficiaries. The money you pay in taxes isn t held in a personal account for you to use when you get benefits. We use your taxes to pay people who are getting benefits right now. Any unused money goes to a Social Security trust fund that pays monthly benefits to you and your family when you start receiving retirement benefits. \n\nAdditional Information \nAn Overview Of Retirement Benefits Your Retirement Benefit : How It s Figured Benefits For Your Family \n\nFAQs \nWhat is the current maximum amount of taxable earnings for Social Security? \n\nPlanning For Retirement \nPlanning is the key to creating your best retirement.

While many factors affect retirement planning , we want you to understand what Social Security can mean to you and your family s financial future. \n\nSocial Security Should Be Just One Part Of Your Retirement Plan \nOn average , retirement beneficiaries receive 40% of their pre - retirement income from Social Security. As you make your retirement plan , knowing the approximate amount you will receive in Social Security benefits can help you determine how much other retirement income you ll need to reach your goals. \n\nAre You Eligible? \nWhen you work and pay Social Security taxes , you earn credits toward Social Security benefits. The number of credits you need to get retirement benefits depends on when you were born. If you were born in 1929 or later , you need 40 credits usually, this is 10 years of work. If you stop working before you have enough credits to qualify for benefits , the credits will remain on your Social Security record. If you return to work later , more credits may be added. We can t pay any retirement benefits until you have 40 credits. Our retirement planner has additional details on how Social Security Credits work. \n\nVerify Your Earnings History \nThe amount of the Social Security benefits you or your family receives depends on the amount of earnings shown on your record.

If you choose to retire begin receiving benefits when you reach your full retirement age , you ll receive your full benefit amount. We will reduce your benefit amount if you retire start benefits before reaching full retirement age. To make an informed choice , consider the following factors as you think about when to start your Social Security benefits. \n\nWhat Age Should You Start To Receive Benefits? \nThe age you begin collecting your retirement benefit affects how much you will receive. There are three important things to know about age when thinking about when to start your benefits. \n\nFull Retirement Age \nFull retirement age is the age when you will be able to collect your full retirement benefit amount. The full retirement age is 66 if you were born from 1943 to 1954. The full retirement age increases gradually if you were born from 1955 to 1960, until it reaches 67. For anyone born 1960 or later , full retirement benefits are payable at age 67. You can find your full retirement age by birth year in the full retirement age chart. \n\nEarly Retirement Age \nYou can get Social Security retirement benefits as early as age 62. However , your benefit is reduced if you start receiving benefits before your full retirement age. Understand how claiming retirement benefits early will affect your benefit amount. \n\nDelayed Retirement Age \nWhen you delay collecting benefits beyond your full retirement age , the amount of your retirement benefit will continue to increase up until age 70. There is no incentive to delay claiming after age 70. \n\nAdditional Information \nWhen To Start Receiving Retirement Benefits Your Options: Working, Applying For Retirement, Or Both? Social Security Credits \n\nFAQs \nWhat is the maximum Social Security retirement benefit payable? When can I get Social Security retirement benefits? \n\nWhat Else Affects Your Retirement Benefits \nEveryone s retirement is unique. Beyond deciding when to begin receiving retirement benefits , other factors that can affect your benefits include whether you continue to work, what type of job you had, and if you have a pension from certain jobs. \n\nContinuing To Work \nYou can choose to keep working beyond your full retirement age. If you do , you can increase your future Social Security benefits. Each extra year you work adds another year of earnings to your Social Security record. Higher lifetime earnings can mean higher benefits when you choose to receive benefits. \n\nSpecific Types Of Earnings \nWhile Social Security earnings are calculated the same way for most American workers , there are some types of earnings that have additional rules. Earning types with special rules include : Farm Work Federal Government Employment Household Employment Military Service Nonprofit Or Religious Organizations Railroad Earnings Self-Employment State And Local Government Employment Wages Work Outside The United States \n\nPensions And Other Factors \nPensions and taxes have the potential to impact your retirement benefit.

How do you protect my identity when I use a my Social Security account? \n\n\n\n\nSocial Security Credits \nYou must earn at least 40 Social Security credits to qualify for Social Security benefits. You earn Social Security credits when you work and pay Social Security taxes. The number of credits does not affect the amount of benefits you receive. It only determines if you are eligible or not. You do not get extra benefits for earning more than the minimum number of credits. We cannot pay benefits to you if you don t have enough credits. We use the amount of credits you ve earned to determine your eligibility for retirement or disability benefits, as well as your family s eligibility for survivors benefits when you die. \n\nHow Credits Are Earned \nSince 1978 , when you work and pay Social Security taxes , you earn up to a maximum of four credits per year. Credits are based on your total wages and self - employment income for the year. You might work all year to earn four credits , or you might earn enough for all four in much less time. The amount of earnings it takes to earn a credit may change each year. In 2020 , you earn one Social Security or Medicare credit for every $1,410 in covered earnings each year. You must earn $5,640 to get the maximum four credits for the year. During your lifetime , you might earn more credits than the minimum number you need to be eligible for benefits. These extra credits do not increase your benefit amount. The average of your earnings over your working years , not the total number of credits you earn , determines how much your monthly payment will be when you receive benefits. Read our publication, \" How You Earn Credits, \" for more information. \n\nNumber Of Credits Needed For Retirement Benefits \nIf you were born after 1928 , you need 40 credits to qualify for retirement. \n\nNumber Of Credits Needed For Disability Benefits \nTo be eligible for disability benefits , you must meet a recent work test and a duration work test. The number of credits necessary to meet the recent work test depends on your age. The rules are as follows : Before age 24 - You may qualify if you have 6 credits earned in the 3-year period ending when your disability starts. Age 24 to 31 In general , you may qualify if you have credit for working half the time between age 21 and the time you become disabled. As a general example , if you become disabled at age 27 , you would need 3 years of work 12 credits out of the past 6 years between ages 21 and 27. Age 31 or older - In general , you must have at least 20 credits in the 10-year period immediately before you become disabled. The following table shows how many years of work credits you need to meet the duration of work test based on your age when your disability began. For the duration of work test , your work does not have to fall within a certain period. The table only provides an estimate of how many work credits you need. It does not cover all situations. If you are statutorily blind , you must only meet the duration of work test. When statutory blindness is involved , there is not a recent work test requirement. NOTE : This table is an estimate only and does not cover all situations \n\nNumber Of Credits Needed For Survivors Benefits \nThe number of credits needed for family members to be eligible for survivors benefits depends on your age when you die. The younger you are , the fewer credits needed. Nobody needs more than 40 credits. Under a special rule , we can pay benefits to your children and your spouse caring for your children, even if your record doesn't have the number of credits needed. They can get benefits if you have credits for one and one - half year's work 6 credits in the three years before your death. If you are already receiving retirement or disability benefits at the time of your death , we will pay your survivors based on that entitlement. We will not have to determine your credits again.

If your income is low enough , your payment could be as low as $0 per month. An income - driven repayment plan sets your monthly student loan payment at an amount that is intended to be affordable based on your income and family size. We offer four income - driven repayment plans : Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan REPAYE Plan Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan PAYE Plan Income - Based Repayment Plan IBR Plan Income - Contingent Repayment Plan ICR Plan If you d like to repay your federal student loans under an income - driven plan , you need to fill out an application.

The percentage is different depending on the plan. The chart below shows how payment amounts are determined under each income - driven plan. Depending on your income and family size , you may have no monthly payment at all. * For the IBR Plan , you're considered a new borrower on or after July 1 , 2014, if you had no outstanding balance on a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program loan or Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan on or after July 1 , 2014. Because no new FFEL Program loans have been made since June 30 , 2010, only Direct Loan borrowers can qualify as new borrowers on or after July 1 , 2014. \n\nHow do I estimate my payment amount? \nUse our Loan Simulator. Loan Simulator provides a comparison of estimated monthly payment amounts for all federal student loan repayment plans, including income - driven plans. This comparison is important because the income - driven plans may not provide you with the lowest payment amount based on your individual circumstances. Your payment may be lower under another repayment plan. \n\nHow long will I be in repayment under each plan? \nIncome - driven repayment plans have different repayment periods. Under all four plans , any remaining loan balance is forgiven if your federal student loans aren't fully repaid at the end of the repayment period. For any income - driven repayment plan , periods of economic hardship deferment , periods of repayment under certain other repayment plans , and periods when your required payment is zero will count toward your total repayment period. Whether you will have a balance left to be forgiven at the end of your repayment period depends on a number of factors, such as how quickly your income rises and how large your income is relative to your debt. Because of these factors , you may fully repay your loan before the end of your repayment period. Your loan servicer will track your qualifying monthly payments and years of repayment and will notify you when you are getting close to the point when you would qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance. If you re making payments under an income - driven repayment plan and also working toward loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Program , you may qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance after you've made 10 years of qualifying payments, instead of 20 or 25 years. Qualifying payments for the PSLF Program include payments made under any of the income - driven repayment plans. \n\nAm I eligible for income-driven repayment? \nDefaulted loans are not eligible for repayment under any of the income - driven repayment plans. Find out how to get out of default. \n\nREPAYE Plan \nAny borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan. \n\nPAYE and IBR Plans \nEach of these plans has an eligibility requirement you must meet to qualify for the plan. To qualify , the payment you would be required to make under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size must be less than what you would pay under the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period. If the amount you would have to pay under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size is more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , you wouldn't benefit from having your monthly payment amount based on your income , so you don't qualify. Generally , you'll meet this requirement if your federal student loan debt is higher than your annual discretionary income or represents a significant portion of your annual income. In addition to meeting the requirement described above , to qualify for the PAYE Plan you must also be a new borrower. This means that you must have had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2007, and you must have received a disbursement of a Direct Loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2011. \n\nICR Plan \nAny borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan. This plan is the only available income - driven repayment option for parent PLUS loan borrowers. Although PLUS loans made to parents can t be repaid under any of the income - driven repayment plans including the ICR Plan , parent borrowers may consolidate their Direct PLUS Loans or Federal PLUS Loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan and then repay the new consolidation loan under the ICR Plan though not under any other income - driven plan. \n\nWill I always pay the same amount each month under an income-driven repayment plan? \nNo. Under all of the income - driven repayment plans , your required monthly payment amount may increase or decrease if your income or family size changes from year to year. Each year you must recertify your income and family size. This means that you must provide your loan servicer with updated income and family size information so that your servicer can recalculate your payment. You must do this even if there has been no change in your income or family size. Your loan servicer will send you a reminder notice when it s time for you to recertify. To recertify , you must submit another income - driven repayment plan application. On the application , you ll be asked to select the reason you re submitting the application. Respond that you are submitting documentation of your income for the annual recertification of your payment amount. Although you re required to recertify your income and family size only once each year, if your income or family size changes significantly before your annual certification date for example, due to loss of employment , you can submit updated information and ask your servicer to recalculate your payment amount at any time. To do this , submit a new application for an income - driven repayment plan. When asked to select the reason for submitting the application , respond that you are submitting documentation early because you want your servicer to recalculate your payment immediately. You re not required to report changes in your financial circumstances before the annual date when you must provide updated income information. You can choose to wait until your loan servicer tells you that you need to provide updated income information at the normally scheduled time. If you choose to wait , your current required monthly payment amount will remain the same until you provide the updated income information. \n\nPAYE and IBR Plans \nUnder these plans , your monthly payment amount will be based on your income and family size when you first begin making payments, and at any time when your income is low enough that your calculated monthly payment amount would be less than the amount you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. If your income ever increases to the point that your calculated monthly payment amount would be more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, you ll remain on the PAYE or IBR plan , but your payment will no longer be based on your income. Instead , your required monthly payment will be the amount you would pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, based on the loan amount you owed when you first began repayment under the PAYE or IBR plan. Even if your income continues to increase , your monthly payment will never be more than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount. During any period when your monthly payment is not based on your income , you still have the option of recertifying your income and family size. If you recertify and your income or family size changes so that your calculated monthly payment would once again be less than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount , your servicer will recalculate your payment and you ll return to making payments that are based on your income. \n\nREPAYE and ICR Plans \nUnder the REPAYE and ICR Plans , your payment is always based on your income and family size, regardless of any changes in your income. This means that if your income increases over time, in some cases your payment may be higher than the amount you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. \n\nWhat will happen if I don t recertify my income and family size by the annual deadline? \nIt s important for you to recertify your income and family size by the specified annual deadline. If you don t recertify your income by the deadline , the consequences vary depending on the plan. Under the REPAYE Plan , if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline , you ll be removed from the REPAYE Plan and placed on an alternative repayment plan. Under this alternative repayment plan , your required monthly payment is not based on your income. Instead , your payment will be the amount necessary to repay your loan in full by the earlier of a 10 years from the date you begin repaying under the alternative repayment plan, or b the ending date of your 20- or 25-year REPAYE Plan repayment period. You may choose to leave the alternative repayment plan and repay under any other repayment plan for which you are eligible. Under the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, or the ICR Plan, if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline , you ll remain on the same income - driven repayment plan , but your monthly payment will no longer be based on your income. Instead , your required monthly payment amount will be the amount you would pay under a Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period, based on the loan amount you owed when you initially entered the income - driven repayment plan. You can return to making payments based on income if you provide your servicer with updated income information, and if your updated income still qualifies you to make payments based on income. In addition to the consequences described above , if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline under the REPAYE, PAYE, and IBR plans , any unpaid interest will be capitalized added to the principal balance of your loans. This will increase the total cost of your loans over time, because you will then pay interest on the increased loan principal balance. Under all of the income - driven repayment plans , if you don t recertify your family size each year , you ll remain on the same repayment plan , but your servicer will assume that you have a family size of one. If your actual family size is larger, but your servicer assumes a family size of one because you didn t recertify your family size , this could result in an increased monthly payment amount or for the PAYE and IBR plans loss of eligibility to make payments based on income. \n\nWhat types of federal student loans can I repay under an income-driven repayment plan? \nThe chart below shows the types of federal student loans that you can repay under each of the income - driven repayment plans. * If a loan type is listed as eligible if consolidated , this means that if you consolidate that loan type into a Direct Consolidation Loan, you can then repay the consolidation loan under the income - driven plan. For example , only Direct Loans can be repaid under the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR plans. However , if you consolidate a FFEL Program Loan or Federal Perkins Loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan , you may then be able to repay the Direct Consolidation Loan under the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR Plan depending on the type of loan that you consolidate. Note that consolidation is not the right choice for all borrowers or all loan types. In particular , you may lose certain loan benefits if you consolidate a Federal Perkins Loan. Find out more about loan consolidation. Only federal student loans can be repaid under the income - driven plans. Private student loans are not eligible. \n\nIs an income-driven repayment plan right for me? \nIncome - driven repayment plans usually lower your federal student loan payments. However , whenever you make lower payments or extend your repayment period , you will likely pay more in interest over time sometimes significantly more. In addition , under current Internal Revenue Service rules , you may be required to pay income tax on any amount that's forgiven if you still have a remaining balance at the end of your repayment period. \n\nHow do I decide which income-driven repayment plan to choose? \nIf you ve decided that an income - driven repayment plan is right for you , you ll want to choose the plan that provides the most benefit to you based on your individual circumstances. Although all four income - driven plans allow you to make a monthly payment based on your income , the plans differ in terms of who qualifies, how much you have to pay each month, the length of the repayment period, and the types of loans that can be repaid under the plan. If you have only Direct Loans , you can choose from all four income - driven repayment plans. If you re not sure which plan to choose , you have the option of requesting the income - driven plan that provides the lowest payment amount. Your servicer will determine which plans you qualify for and will then place you on the plan with the lowest monthly payment. If you have FFEL Program loans , your only income - driven repayment plan option is the IBR Plan. However , if you consolidate your FFEL Program loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan , you ll then have access to the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR plans. Find out more about loan consolidation. \n\nHow do I apply for an income-driven repayment plan? \nBefore you apply for an income - driven repayment plan , contact your loan servicer if you have any questions. Your loan servicer will help you decide whether one of these plans is right for you. To apply , you must submit an application called the Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request. You can submit the application online or on a paper form, which you can get from your loan servicer. The application allows you to select an income - driven repayment plan by name, or to request that your loan servicer determine what income - driven plan or plans you qualify for, and to place you on the income - driven plan with the lowest monthly payment amount. Note: If you have more than one servicer for the loans that you want to repay under an income - driven plan , you must submit a separate request to each servicer. When you apply , you ll be asked to provide income information that will be used to determine your eligibility for the PAYE or IBR plans and to calculate your monthly payment amount under all income - driven repayment plans. This may be either your adjusted gross income AGI or alternative documentation of income. Your AGI will be used if you filed a federal income tax return in the past two years , and your current income isn t significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal income tax return. You can provide your AGI in one of the following ways : Apply using the online Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool in the application to transfer income information from your federal income tax return. Use the paper Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request and provide a paper copy of your most recently filed federal income tax return or IRS tax return transcript. If you haven t filed a federal income tax return in the past two years, or if your current income is significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal income tax return for example, if you lost your job or have experienced a drop in income , alternative documentation of your income will be used to determine your eligibility and calculate your monthly payment amount. You can provide alternative documentation in one of the following ways : If you currently receive taxable income , you must submit a paper Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request with alternative documentation of your income, such as a pay stub. If you currently don t have any income or if you receive only untaxed income , you can indicate that on the online or paper application. In this case , you re not required to supply further documentation of your income. Depending on whether you applied electronically or submitted a paper request form and whether you ve submitted all required documents , it may take your servicer a few weeks to process your request, because they will need to obtain documentation of your income and family size. If you are currently repaying your loans under a different repayment plan , your loan servicer may apply a forbearance to your student loan account while processing your request for an income - driven repayment plan. \n\nWhat other options do I have if I need help repaying my student loans? \nIf an income - driven repayment plan isn t right for you , contact your loan servicer to discuss other repayment options. You may be able to extend your repayment period through the Extended Repayment Plan or through loan consolidation. You may also be able to temporarily suspend repayment through a deferment or forbearance. \n\nWhere can I learn more about the income-driven repayment plans? \nWant more information about the income - driven repayment plans?

Keep reading to see whether you might qualify. Alert! If your PSLF application is denied because some or all of your payments were not made under a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF , you might still be eligible for forgiveness through Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Learn more. The PSLF Program forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full - time for a qualifying employer. PSLF Resources Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Help Tool Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Employment Certification Form Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Application for Forgiveness Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program FAQ \n\nQualifying for PSLF \nTo qualify for PSLF , you must be employed by a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or not - for - profit organization ; work full - time for that agency or organization ; have Direct Loans or consolidate other federal student loans into a Direct Loan ; repay your loans under an income - driven repayment plan; and make 120 qualifying payments. To ensure you re on the right track , you should submit a Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form annually or when you change employers. We ll use the information you provide on the form to let you know if you are making qualifying PSLF payments. This will help you determine if you re on the right track as early as possible. \n\nQualifying Employment \nQualifying employment for the PSLF Program isn t about the specific job that you do for your employer. Instead , it s about who your employer is. Employment with the following types of organizations qualifies for PSLF : Government organizations at any level U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal Not - for - profit organizations that are tax - exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code Serving as a full - time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer also counts as qualifying employment for the PSLF Program. The following types of employers do not qualify for PSLF : Labor unions Partisan political organizations For - profit organizations, including for - profit government contractors Contractors : You must be directly employed by a qualifying employer for your employment to count toward PSLF. If you re employed by an organization that is doing work under a contract with a qualifying employer , it is your employer s status not the status of the organization that your employer has a contract with that determines whether your employment qualifies for PSLF. For example , if you re employed by a for - profit contractor that is doing work for a qualifying employer , your employment does not count toward PSLF. Other types of not - for - profit organizations : If you work for a not - for - profit organization that is not tax - exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, it can still be considered a qualifying employer if it provides certain types of qualifying public services. However , in our experience , few organizations meet these criteria. \n\nFull-time Employment \nFor PSLF , you re generally considered to work full - time if you meet your employer s definition of full - time or work at least 30 hours per week, whichever is greater. If you are employed in more than one qualifying part - time job at the same time , you will be considered full - time if you work a combined average of at least 30 hours per week with your employers. If you are employed by a not - for - profit organization , time spent on religious instruction, worship services, or any form of proselytizing may not be counted toward meeting the full - time employment requirement. \n\nEligible Loans \nAny loan received under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program qualifies for PSLF. Loans from these federal student loan programs don't qualify for PSLF: the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program and the Federal Perkins Loan Perkins Loan Program. However , they may become eligible if you consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Student loans from private lenders do not qualify for PSLF. If you consolidate your loans , only qualifying payments that you make on the new Direct Consolidation Loan can be counted toward the 120 payments required for PSLF. Any payments you made on the loans before you consolidated them don t count. The PSLF Help Tool will tell you whether you need to consolidate some or all of your loans. \n\nQualifying Payments \nA qualifying monthly payment is a payment that you make after Oct. 1 , 2007 ; under a qualifying repayment plan ; for the full amount due as shown on your bill ; no later than 15 days after your due date ; and while you are employed full - time by a qualifying employer. You can make qualifying monthly payments only during periods when you re required to make a payment. Therefore , you can t make a qualifying monthly payment while your loans are in an in-school status, the grace period , a deferment , or a forbearance. If you want to make qualifying payments, but you re in a deferment or forbearance , contact your federal student loan servicer to waive the deferment or forbearance. Your 120 qualifying monthly payments don t need to be consecutive. For example , if you have a period of employment with a nonqualifying employer , you will not lose credit for prior qualifying payments you made. The best way to ensure that you are making on - time, complete payments is to sign up for automatic debit with your loan servicer. \n\nCan I qualify sooner by making higher monthly payments? \nNo. If you make a monthly payment for more than the amount you are required to pay , you should keep in mind that you can receive credit for only one payment per month, no matter how much you pay. You can t qualify for PSLF faster by making larger payments. If you want to pay more than your required monthly payment amount , you should contact your servicer and ask that the extra amount not be applied to cover future payments. Otherwise, you may end up being paid ahead , and you can t receive credit for a qualifying PSLF payment during a month when no payment is due. \n\nWhat if I m in AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps, or my loans are being repaid by the U.S. Department of Defense? \nThere are special rules that allow borrowers who are AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteers to use their Segal Education Award or Peace Corps transition payment to make a single lump - sum payment that may count for up to 12 qualifying PSLF payments. In addition , borrowers who have lump - sum payments made on their behalf under a student loan repayment program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense may also receive credit for more than one qualifying PSLF payment. \n\nQualifying Repayment Plans \nQualifying repayment plans include all of the income - driven repayment IDR plans plans that base your monthly payment on your income. While payments made under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan are qualifying payments , you would have to change to an IDR plan to benefit from PSLF. Under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , your loans will be paid in full once you have made the 120 qualifying PSLF payments and there will be no balance to forgive. Before you change to an IDR plan , however , you should understand that your payment may increase under these plans depending on your income and the amount that you owe. If this is the case for you, and you do not wish to pay this higher amount , then the PSLF Program may not benefit you. The following repayment plans do not qualify for PSLF : Standard Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans Graduated Repayment Plan Extended Repayment Plan Alternative Repayment Plan \n\nPSLF Process \nBecause you have to make 120 qualifying monthly payments , it will take at least 10 years before you can qualify for PSLF. Important : You must be working for a qualifying employer at the time you submit the application for forgiveness and at the time the remaining balance on your loan is forgiven. If you are working toward PSLF , you should complete and submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form often referred to as the ECF annually or when you change employers. If you have made 120 qualifying payments , you should fill out and submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Application for Forgiveness PSLF application. Either way , we ll use the information you provide on the form to let you know if you are making qualifying PSLF payments. This will help you determine if you re on the right track as early as possible. Alert! If you don t periodically submit the Employment Certification Form , then at the time you apply for forgiveness , you will be required to submit an Employment Certification Form for each employer where you worked while making the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. \n\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Help Tool \nThe PSLF Help Tool will help you understand more about the PSLF Program and what you need to do to participate and possibly have your loans forgiven ; help you assess whether your employer qualifies for PSLF ; help you assess whether your loans qualify for PSLF ; help you decide which PSLF form to submit ; and use the information we have about your federal student loans to explain other actions you should or must take if you want to receive PSLF. At this time , the PSLF Help Tool won t allow you or your employer to electronically sign the forms that the tool will generate for you. Therefore , after you complete the PSLF Help Tool process , you will need to print the PDF document that the tool generates, sign it yourself, have your employer sign it, and then submit the form to the PSLF servicer as instructed on the printed PDF document. \n\nEmployment Certification Form Process \nAfter you submit an Employment Certification Form , your loans will transfer to the PSLF servicer. After the PSLF servicer determines how many qualifying payments you made during the period on your Employment Certification Form , you ll receive a letter telling you the number of qualifying payments you have made. The number of qualifying payments you have made will only be updated whenever you submit another Employment Certification Form or PSLF application that documents a new period of qualifying employment. You can find out how many qualifying payments you ve made by logging in to your account with the PSLF servicer and viewing your loan details or by looking on your most recent billing statement. \n\nEmployment Certification \nYour employment can be certified by an official who has access to your employment or service records and is authorized by your employer to certify your employment or your service as an AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer. This will often be someone in the human resources department, though in some cases your direct supervisor or another individual may be authorized to certify your employment. Check with your organization to see who is allowed to certify your Employment Certification Form. \n\nTax on Forgiveness \nAmounts forgiven under the PSLF Program are not considered income by the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore , you will not have to pay federal income tax on the amount of your Direct Loans that is forgiven. \n\nHow to Submit PSLF Forms \nSend the completed form, with your employer s certification, to FedLoan Servicing, the U.S. Department of Education s federal loan servicer for the PSLF Program. You may mail the form to this address : U.S. Department of Education FedLoan Servicing P.O. Box 69184 Harrisburg, PA 17106 - 9184 You may also fax your PSLF application or Employment Certification Form to 717 - 720 - 1628. If FedLoan Servicing is already your servicer , you may upload your PSLF application or Employment Certification Form on their website. \n\nContact for PSLF Questions \nIf you have more questions , review the PSLF FAQ page.

What if I miss the deadline for submitting my request? What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer? What should I expect if I request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge? What if I want to change my review option after submitting a form? How do I opt in if I want my legacy claim or appeal to be considered in the modernized system? \n\nWhat s new and relevant evidence? \nIn order to file a Supplemental Claim , you have to add evidence that s both new and relevant. New evidence is information that VA didn t have before the last decision. Relevant evidence is information that could prove or disprove something about your case. VA can t accept a Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence. You can either submit the evidence yourself or identify evidence, like medical records, that you d like VA to get for you. \n\nWhat s Duty to Assist? \nVA s Duty to Assist requires VA to assist you in getting evidence, such as medical records, that s needed to support your case. VA s Duty to Assist applies during your initial claim and if you file a Supplemental Claim. If you request a Higher - Level Review or Board Appeal , Duty to Assist doesn t apply. However , the reviewer or judge will look at whether VA met its Duty to Assist during your initial claim or Supplemental Claim , and if not, they ll have VA correct that error. Your review may take longer if this is needed. \n\nWhat if I miss the deadline for submitting my request? \nSubmitting your request on time will ensure that you receive the maximum benefit if your case is granted. Please check the deadline for each review option and submit your request before that date. If the deadline has passed , you can either : Add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim. Because the deadline has passed , the effective date for benefits will generally be tied to the date VA receives the new request, not the date VA received your initial claim. Send a letter to VA requesting that it revise the decision based on a Clear and Unmistakable Error CUE. CUE is a specific and rare kind of error. To prove CUE , you must show that the correct facts, known at the time, were not before VA or that VA incorrectly applied the law as it existed at the time. It must be undebatable that an error occurred and that this error changed the outcome of your case. Misinterpretation of the facts or a failure by VA to meet its Duty to Assist aren t sufficient reasons. Please seek guidance from a qualified representative, as you can only request CUE once per decision. If you disagree with a Board decision , your decision will have information on additional ways to address errors. \n\nWhat should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer? \nIf you request an informal conference with a senior reviewer on the Higher - Level Review option , they ll call the phone number that you or your representative provided on the Higher - Level Review form to schedule a time to discuss your case with you. The senior reviewer will try to reach you or your representative by phone twice. If no one answers , they ll leave a voice mail. During the call , you and/or your representative can talk about why you think the decision should be changed and identify errors. There won t be transcripts of this call. \n\nWhat should I expect if I request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge? \nYou have the option to request a hearing with a judge. A video conference hearing will take place at a VA location near you. At your hearing , you and the judge will have a conversation. The judge will listen to your testimony. The judge may ask you a few questions. Your representative , if you have one , may help you at the hearing. The hearing will be transcribed and added to your appeal file. You can add new and relevant evidence within 90 days after the hearing , but it isn t required. \n\nWhat if I want to choose a different review option after I ve already submitted a form? \nIf you ve submitted a form and want to change your review option , you can send in a new decision review request form within 1 year from the date on your VA decision. You must include a letter that says you want to withdraw your existing review and switch to a different option. If you requested a Board Appeal and want to switch to a different appeal option , you can send in a new Board Appeal form with a different option selected. You can switch appeal options within 1 year from the date on your VA decision or 60 days from the date you submitted your original form.
