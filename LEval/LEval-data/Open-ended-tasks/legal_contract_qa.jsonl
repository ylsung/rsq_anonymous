Upon any termination of this Agreement or, in the event of any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, upon the expiration of such period, and within fifteen (15) days after request by the disclosing party, each receiving party will return the Confidential Information of the other or destroy such Confidential Information and all copies of it and all information, records and materials developed therefrom, except that the recipient may retain one copy for archival purposes to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein will require the erasure, deletion, alteration or destruction of any Confidential Information required to be retained for legal or regulatory purposes or stored on back-up tapes or other back-up media or archiving systems made in the ordinary course of business, subject in each case to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein. Each party may only disclose the general nature, but not the specific terms, of this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party; provided, however, either party may provide a copy of this Agreement or otherwise disclose its terms on a confidential basis in connection with any legal or regulatory requirement, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry. For clarity, in the event that use, disclosure or retention of any Confidential Information is required in order for DIALOG to exercise the license granted in Section 2, this Section 10 will not be deemed to prevent such use, disclosure or retention.\n\n  Page 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.3 Required Disclosure. Nothing herein will prevent a receiving party from disclosing all or part of the other's Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to court order, the lawful requirement of a governmental agency or when disclosure is required by operation of law (including disclosures pursuant to applicable securities laws or regulations thereunder); provided, that prior to any such disclosure, the receiving party will use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the disclosing party in writing of such requirement to disclose, and (b) cooperate fully with the disclosing party in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure or obtaining a protective order.   11. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMERS.   11.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties. ENERGOUS and DIALOG hereby each represent and warrant to the other that as of the Effective Date:   (a) it is a duly and validly organized and existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the state or country of its incorporation, as applicable, and that it is legally qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which this Agreement may be performed and the performance of its activities hereunder requires such qualification;   (b)  the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will not result in any breach or violation of any terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents, or any material agreement or instrument to which it is a party, by which it is bound, or to which any of its property is subject;   (c) all requisite corporate action has been taken for the due authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it, and this Agreement constitutes a legally binding obligation, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally; and\n\n  Page 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (d) it is not a party to any litigation relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to affect, its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   11.2 Product Warranty.   (a)  ENERGOUS warrants that (i) when manufactured in accordance with the Approved Production Specifications, and as implemented in a suitable circuit application in accordance with the Product Specifications, the Products and Product Die will conform to the Product Specifications and will be free from defects that could have been avoided in their design; (ii) the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation and the Deposit Materials do not infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights; (iii) it did not misappropriate any third party's trade secrets in the development of the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation or the Deposit Materials; and (iv) when delivered (including any software updates if any), no Product will contain any viruses, \"Trojan horses\" or other harmful code. The above warranties are valid for a period of [***] from the date of shipment of any Licensed Product to any customer.   (b) The warranty contained in Section 11.2(a) does not apply to the extent any Product is operated in a manner other than that specified by the Product Specifications, is treated with abuse, negligence or other improper treatment (including, without limitation, use outside the device maximum ratings, package MSL (moisture sensitivity level) guidelines or environmental limits as may be set forth in the Product Specifications), or is defective as a result of any materials or workmanship of the Manufacturing Subcontractors or failure of the Manufacturing Subcontractors to manufacture the Product according to Approved Production Specifications. As such, any warranty claims due to defects in build, materials or workmanship will be directed to the Manufacturing Subcontractors as part of that contract between DIALOG or, if applicable, its Affiliate and such parties.   (c) With the exception of the warranties in Section 11.2(a)(ii) (third party IP infringement) and Section 11.2(a)(iii) (misappropriation of third party trade secrets) related to any Product Die, the warranties in this Section 11.2 do not apply to MCMs or repackaged Product Die developed by or for DIALOG or its Affiliates.   (d) In the event any warranty claim is due to or arises from an Epidemic Defect, ENERGOUS will be responsible for all costs and expenses directly incurred by DIALOG or its Affiliates or their respective customers as a result of reasonable inspection, servicing, repairs, replacements, recall notices, recalls and responses with respect thereto, provided that ENERGOUS' aggregate liability to DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers under this paragraph (d) will not exceed [***] per occurrence of an Epidemic Defect. Each party will immediately notify the other upon becoming aware of the circumstance that could reasonably be construed to be an indication of an Epidemic Defect, and, in any event, will notify the other party immediately upon becoming aware of the existence of an Epidemic Defect. ENERGOUS and DIALOG will expeditiously work together in good faith to determine a technical resolution of the Epidemic Failure. ENERGOUS agrees to make all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly diagnose the Epidemic Failure's root cause, provide DIALOG a report detailing the results of ENERGOUS' investigation and plan an effective workaround and a permanent solution. ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds and other solutions.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.3  Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. If any of the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials is, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Intellectual Property Rights infringement claim, and as a result DIALOG or any of its Affiliates or their respective customers are enjoined, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion are likely to be enjoined, from using the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, ENERGOUS will use its best efforts to:   (a) procure for DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers the right to continue to use the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable; or, but only in the event that, despite ENERGOUS' best efforts to do so, ENERGOUS is unable to so procure such right,   (b) replace or modify the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable, to make them non-infringing, provided that the replaced or modified Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials remain substantially similar in performance to the infringing Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials.   If none of the foregoing alternatives is available within a commercially reasonable time period, DIALOG may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect, provided that it will give ENERGOUS prompt prior written notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 11.3 is intended to limit DIALOG's rights to indemnification under Section 12 in connection with any such infringement claim.   11.4  Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11, THE PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCT IP, TOOLING, DOCUMENTATION, DEPOSIT MATERIALS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND ALL LICENSES, SERVICES AND OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY A PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. EXCEPT FOR THOSE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE.   12. INDEMNIFICATION.   12.1 Indemnification by Energous. Subject to Section 12.2, ENERGOUS agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, in the case of any third party claims, defend DIALOG and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, distributors and customers (collectively, \"DIALOG Indemnitees\") from and against and in respect of any and all alleged or actual demands, claims, actions, causes of action, suits or proceedings, assessments, awarded damages (including punitive damages), liabilities, interest and penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and disbursements in connection therewith) (each, a \"Claim\") to the extent resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any DIALOG Indemnitees by reason of (a) death or bodily injury caused by or resulting from use of the Products, (b) any breach of any representation or warranty made by ENERGOUS hereunder or to any third party in relation to the Products or Product Die, (c) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights in relation to the Products or Product Die, (d) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights as a result of DIALOG's or its Affiliates' exercise of rights in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Manufacturing Subcontractors' manufacture of the Products on their behalf, provided that the Products are manufactured in strict compliance with the Product Specifications and Approved Production Specifications and only to the extent such Claims arise due to compliance with the Product Specifications and/or the Approved Production Specifications or use of the Tooling provided by ENERGOUS hereunder, (e) the infringement by DIALOG of any third party Marks rights as a result of its authorized use of the ENERGOUS Marks, (f) any failure by ENERGOUS to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (g) ENERGOUS' negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud.\n\n  Page 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.2 Exclusion. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.1, ENERGOUS will not be liable to the extent any Claim results from (a) modification of the Products by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party (including the Manufacturing Subcontractors), or combination of the Products with other products, offered by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party, (b) acts or omissions of any Manufacturing Subcontractor (except to the extent such Claims are due to the infringement or misappropriation of third party Intellectual Property Rights arising from such Manufacturing Subcontractor's manufacturing of the Products on behalf of DIALOG in strict compliance with the Product Specifications, Approved Production Specifications and Tooling provided by ENERGOUS), (c) failure of any DIALOG Indemnitee to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (d) negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud of any DIALOG Indemnitee. For clarification, if any of the foregoing is not the cause, in whole or in part of the Claim, ENERGOUS is not relieved of its obligations under Section 12.1.   12.3 Conditions. DIALOG must notify ENERGOUS within thirty (30) business days after receipt of actual notice of any Claim by a third party for which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, any failure or delay in notice will not relieve ENERGOUS of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that ENERGOUS is actually prejudiced by such failure to notify. ENERGOUS will have control and authority with respect to the defense, litigation, compromise or settlement of such third party Claim (except to the extent that any settlement involves any commitments, responsibilities or obligations on the part of DIALOG, in which case such settlement will require the prior written consent of DIALOG, which consent will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). DIALOG will cooperate and provide assistance and information as may reasonably be required by ENERGOUS (but at ENERGOUS' expense) in connection therewith. DIALOG reserves the right to participate at its own cost in any third party proceedings with counsel of its own choosing. In the event that ENERGOUS does not respond to any third party Claim or does not sufficiently defend such third party Claim, DIALOG, acting reasonably, may step in and take over the defense of such Claim. Costs incurred in the settlement of any Claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable legal expenses, may be off set against future Royalties and Service Fees payable.\n\n  Page 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.4 Insurance. Each party will maintain, during the Term and for three (3) years thereafter, such comprehensive general liability insurance (including without limitation, products liability) as will adequately protect it against its potential liabilities under this Agreement, in amounts customary in the semiconductor industry for similar services and products. Each party will, at the other party's request, provide to the other party a certificate of insurance evidencing the foregoing insurance coverage.   13.

Each party will comply with all law and regulations applicable such party's performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to U.S. Export Administration laws and regulations and any other export, import and re-export control laws applicable to such party. The parties will refrain from exporting or re-exporting the Products or Product IP or any technical data or other materials received from each other, or the direct product of any of these, to any country, individual or organization proscribed by the United States government, unless properly authorized by the appropriate agencies of the United States government.

ENERGOUS will at its expense, at DIALOG's written request during the Term and any Wind Down Period, enter into a three- party escrow deposit arrangement, in accordance with this Section 16, with a recognized escrow agent (the \"Escrow Agent\") of mutual agreement. ENERGOUS will keep the Deposit Materials in escrow and ensure on a quarterly basis that all the information relating to the Deposit Materials in escrow is current, including deposit of any Product Updates.   16.2 Release of Deposit Materials. In the event of any Insolvency Event and where the design files need to be accessed by DIALOG to fix an Epidemic Defect or other Product design or production issue impacting yield or quality (\"Release Condition\"), the Escrow Agent will, in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement between the parties and the Escrow Agent (the \"Escrow Agreement\"), release the Deposit Materials to DIALOG.   16.3 License.

The licenses granted pursuant to this Agreement are license to rights in \"intellectual property\" (as that term is defined in Section 101 of the United States Bankruptcy Code) and governed by 11 USC Section 365(n). Accordingly, if a trustee in bankruptcy rejects the Escrow Agreement and/or this Agreement as executory contracts, then Company may elect to retain its rights under this Agreement in accordance with and subject to the provisions of 11 USC Section 365(n).\n\n  Page 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  17. PUBLICITY.   17.1 Publicity.

ENERGOUS and DIALOG acknowledge and agree that the covenants in this Section 18 are reasonable and necessary to protect each of their trade secrets, Confidential Information and stable workforces.   19. CHOICE OF LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.   19.1 Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of conflict of laws principles.   19.2 Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any matters regarding its existence, scope, validity, breach or termination, or any non-contractual obligations arising out of or related to it) that is not able to be resolved through negotiations will be submitted to arbitration in San Francisco, California, administered by the International Chamber of Commerce under its Rules of Arbitration. There will be one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration will be English. The award will be in writing, state the reasons for the award and be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. Except as may be required by law, the parties will preserve the confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be the sole and exclusive forum for final resolution of any such dispute or claim, provided, however, that, because each party will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information of the other party, the unauthorized use or disclosure of which may cause irreparable harm and significant injury which may be difficult to ascertain and which may not be compensable by damages alone, the parties agree that the damaged party will have the right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that it may have for such unauthorized use or disclosure. Each party irrevocably waives all rights to a jury trial in any judicial proceeding permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the validity, construction, and enforceability of this Agreement and the resolution of disputes arising out of and relating to this Agreement, will be governed solely by this Section 19.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  20.

The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Facility will require either expansion or modification (which may include moving to or adding another location) to meet future capacity requirements for the Product. By no later than [***], MediWound shall fund, at its sole cost, the expansion of its annual manufacturing capacity to be [***] of Intermediate Drug Product (whether provided in that form or in the form of the equivalent amount of Finished Product). The Parties will in good faith review existing market research to mutually agree on peak anticipated volume prior to [***]. After the foregoing expansion, the expanded capacity shall be deemed the \"Maximum Capacity\" for purposes of this Agreement. As part of the expansion of the Facility, the Parties will discuss any shut down or transfer to another facility made in connection therewith.\n\n(b) Shut-Down or Expansion of Facility; Transfer to Another Facility. In the event that MediWound desires to cease or shut down operations at a Facility, expand or modify a Facility, or transfer the Manufacturing of a Product to another facility which would reasonably be anticipated to result in inability (permanent or temporary) of MediWound to Manufacture, supply or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder, MediWound shall provide prior written notice to Vericel within the applicable Change Notification Period of such planned shut-down, cessation, expansion, modification or transfer. During such Change Notification Period, Vericel\n\n7 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nwill have the right to order, and in such case MediWound will manufacture, up to [***] of quantities of Product set forth in the Rolling Forecast with respect to such Change Notification Period which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MediWound shall remain obligated to supply Product at the then current Facility and will not supply Product to Vericel from a new facility unless and until MediWound can perform the Manufacturing and supply Product from such new Facility in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any modifications to the regulatory filings for such Product are approved by the relevant Regulatory Authorities. MediWound shall bear all costs incurred in connection with the shut-down, cessation, expansion or modification of the Facility or transfer of the Manufacturing of a Product to a new facility pursuant to this Section 2.6(b), including any costs associated with changes to the regulatory filings. Once such new facility is able to Manufacture in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all required regulatory changes have been approved, such new facility shall be the Facility for purposes of such Product under this Agreement.\n\n2.7 Establishment of Second Source.\n\n(a) Within [***] of the Effective Date, MediWound must provide Vericel with true and accurate copies of all documents consistent with Schedule 2.7. If MediWound does not provide all documents within [***] of the Effective Date, Vericel's obligation under Section 8.1 regarding the time period to provide MediWound with a notice of an extension of the Initial Term shall be extended by the amount of time beyond [***] taken by MediWound to provide the required documents.\n\n(b) Within [***] of a request by Vericel to initiate technology transfer or as soon as reasonably practicable upon request by Vericel in connection with a Supply Failure, MediWound shall provide Vericel, at Vericel's cost consistent with Schedule 4.5, with information necessary for Vericel to qualify a second or back-up supplier identified by Vericel for the Manufacture and supply of Product (a \"Second Source\") and facilitate technology transfer to such Second Source so that Vericel can consistently manufacture intermediate and final product that meets all specifications. MediWound will notify the IIA in accordance with applicable Israeli Laws upon the commencement of Manufacture of Product by such Second Source. MediWound will provide Vericel with access to the manufacturing process and information and any and all original processes, records, and any other information required to manufacture, package and test the Product in accordance with the Specifications. Second Source manufacturers shall be permitted to manufacture Product for Vericel, its Affiliates and Sublicensees as provided in Section 9.1 and the License Agreement; provided that such Second Source manufacturers: [***].\n\n2.8 Forecasting and Ordering.\n\n(a) Forecasting. Vericel shall furnish MediWound with a [***] rolling forecast of the quantities of each Product that Vericel intends to order during the succeeding [***] period (each, a \"Rolling Forecast\") which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity for the Binding Forecast. No later than [***] after the filing of a BLA, Vericel shall\n\n8 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nfurnish MediWound the first rolling Forecast. Subject to this Section 2.8, the [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall constitute a binding order for the quantities of Product specified (\"Binding Forecast\"). The remaining [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall be non-binding, but shall represent Vericel's good faith estimate, as of the date of its submission of the Rolling Forecast, of its forecasted requirements of the Product during such period. MediWound shall maintain at all times the manufacturing capacity at the relevant Facility to manufacture [***] of the quantities of Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity.\n\n(b) Purchase Orders. On a Calendar Quarter basis, Vericel shall issue at least one Purchase Order for the number and unit size of each Product specified in the Binding Forecast. Vericel is not limited to one Purchase Order per Calendar Quarter. Each Purchase Order shall specify (i) a purchase order number; (ii) the quantity of units of each Product to be Manufactured; and (iii) the requested delivery date of such Product (which in no event shall be earlier than [***] days following the date the applicable Purchase Order was received by MediWound). MediWound shall respond to each Purchase Order within [***] of receipt by: (i) accepting such Purchase Order if it conforms to the requirements of this Agreement or (ii) notifying Vericel if such Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement. If MediWound timely notifies Vericel that a Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Parties shall confer as soon as reasonably practicable to resolve any issues related to such purported nonconformity. If MediWound fails to respond to a Purchase Order that is consistent with the Binding Forecast within [***] after receiving it, Vericel will, within [***] thereafter, confirm with MediWound that such Purchase Order was received by MediWound, and if such Purchase Order is consistent with the Binding Forecast and was properly submitted by Vericel in accordance with this Section 2.8(b), MediWound shall be deemed to have accepted such Purchase Order (\"Binding Order\") as of the date of MediWound's receipt of such Purchase Order. If a Purchase Order contains quantities of Products in excess of the quantity of such Product forecasted for such quarter (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) by an amount greater than [***] of the Binding Forecast (\"Excess Amount\"), MediWound will accept the Purchase Order up to, but not including the Excess Amount which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Should Vericel place a Purchase Order to procure a given Product in a given Calendar Quarter which includes an Excess Amount, MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet Vericel's request. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, this Agreement shall govern.\n\n(c) Minimum Purchase Obligation. In each Calendar Year following Vericel's submission of the first Rolling Forecast, Vericel shall issue Purchase Orders for at least [***] of the quantities of each Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year).\n\n(d) BARDA. As of the Effective Date, MediWound is a party to BARDA Contract HHSO100201500035C and BARDA Contract HHSO100201800023C (collectively, the\n\n9 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n\"BARDA Agreements\") with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (\"BARDA\"). The Parties agree that until commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, MediWound shall remain responsible for the supply and other obligations and shall manage the forecasts and production schedule for such BARDA Agreements. During such period, any Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will not be included in Purchase Orders, Binding Orders, Rolling Forecasts or the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c); provided that the Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will be included in the Maximum Capacity and thus the applicable Maximum Capacity for the Binding Orders will be adjusted accordingly. If and when commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, then Vericel shall become responsible for including the applicable purchases by BARDA in its Purchase Orders, Binding Orders and Rolling Forecasts and such purchases will be included in the Maximum Capacity and the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c).\n\n2.9 Delivery.\n\n(a) Shipping. MediWound shall only ship Products that have been Manufactured and released in accordance with the Specifications. Unless agreed in advance by Vericel and MediWound in writing, MediWound shall not ship (or permit such Third Party packager to ship) any Products prior to approval and release by MediWound in accordance with the Quality Agreement and Regulatory Standards. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, Products shall be delivered to Vericel Ex-Works (Incoterms 2010), at MediWound's facility (the \"Delivery Site\") at which point, the title and risk of loss shall transfer to Vericel which shall transfer the Products from the Delivery Site in accordance with cGMP as applicable. MediWound shall notify (or cause such Third Party packager to notify) Vericel at least [***] prior to any shipment of Products.\n\n(b) Delivery Amount. MediWound shall deliver Product within [***] of the units set out on the relevant Purchase Order. To the extent that a delivery is in excess of [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel may accept such excess Product provided that if Vericel accepts such excess, Vericel shall be entitled, (i) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product to the extent reasonably required due to the acceptance of such excess, and (ii) to reduce subsequent Purchase Orders and take credits for the amount of excess Product received against the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c). To the extent that a delivery is less than [***] but at least [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel shall accept such delivery and shall be entitled, (A) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product due to the acceptance of such delivery, and (B) to increase subsequent Purchase Orders with the applicable shortage quantities.\n\n(c) On Time Delivery. MediWound's performance with respect to \"on time delivery\" will be measured as delivery to Vericel [***] before or after the delivery date agreed\n\n10 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8; provided that MediWound shall be deemed to have made a delivery during the \"on time delivery\" window if the delay in delivery to Vericel is due to Vericel's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (including in connection with Vericel's review of the Batch records).\n\n2.10 Dating. The remaining shelf-life for each Product for the Territory shall be at least [***] of the FDA approved shelf-life of such Product, as measured from the time of delivery of such Product to Vericel (the \"Minimum Shelf Life\").\n\n2.11 Safety Stock. MediWound shall be entitled to meet its obligation to maintain as safety stock not less than [***] of the Rolling Forecast demand of stock of each of the Key Materials (the \"Safety Stock\") so long as the Minimum Shelf Life has been satisfied by holding either Product or an equivalent quantity of Materials, or a mixture of the two. The Parties will cooperate to set minimum inventory levels of Key Materials held by Key Materials Suppliers. Vericel shall maintain an inventory of [***] supply of unlabeled or labeled Finished Product in order to supply its commercial requirements in accordance with the Rolling Forecast, which may be stored at Facility at Vericel's option, cost and risk.\n\n2.12 Non-Conforming Product.\n\n(a) Rejection Notice. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, within [***] after receipt of a delivery of Product hereunder, Vericel shall give MediWound written notice of rejection (\"Rejection Notice\") (i) if the Product does not constitute Conforming Product (\"Non-Conforming Product\") or (ii) of any shortage in quantity of such delivery of Product. Any such Rejection Notice provided with respect to any quantity of Product shall be deemed to apply to the full Batch of such Product unless otherwise specified by Vericel. Vericel shall be deemed to have accepted such shipment of Product as Conforming Product and any shortage in quantity if it does not provide Rejection Notice within [***] after receipt of delivery describing the reasons for such rejections in reasonable detail, provided, however, that such [***] period shall not apply to any Latent Defects, in which case Vericel shall notify MediWound of any such failure as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within [***] after the Latent Defect is confirmed by Vericel and prior to expiration of the shelf-life for such Product.\n\n(b) Disputes. In the event that MediWound disagrees with Vericel's claim that Product fails to constitute Conforming Product, then the Parties shall promptly attempt to resolve such dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute, a sample of such Product shall be submitted by MediWound and Vericel to a mutually agreeable qualified Third Party laboratory for testing against the applicable Specifications, Regulatory Standards and other standards and controls in the Quality Agreement and the test results obtained by such laboratory shall be final and controlling (absent manifest error). Test results must be furnished to both Parties within [***] of concluding such testing. The fees and expenses of such laboratory testing and any obsolescence due to short dating shall be borne entirely by the Party whose original Product analysis was in error.\n\n11 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Remedy. On receipt of Vericel's Rejection Notice pursuant to Section 2.12(a), subject to Section 2.12(b), MediWound shall, [***] (except if such Non-Conforming Product is due to MediWound's gross negligence or willful misconduct):\n\n(i) deliver the appropriate shortage quantities of Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel;\n\n(ii) replace the Non-Conforming Product with Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel; or\n\n(iii) promptly grant Vericel a credit in an amount equal to the amount paid or payable by Vericel with respect to reasonable out of pocket expenses directly associated with the Non-Conforming Product to the extent applicable (e.g. shipment costs, destruction fees, and restocking fees) and any such shortage or Non-Conforming Product, including, without limitation, but solely in the case of Non-Conforming Product, expenses associated with destruction or return at MediWound's instruction. This subsection (iii) shall additionally apply in the event Vericel elects as its option the foregoing (i) or (ii), as applicable, and such delivery or replace of Product thereunder is not practicable within a reasonable period of time (as reasonably determined by MediWound).\n\n2.13 Shortages.\n\n(a) Without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Vericel, in the event of any shortage in the supply of any Materials or Product, or if MediWound is for any other reason unable to supply Product in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then MediWound will promptly notify Vericel and, in the event such inability is caused by a shortage of any Materials and/or capacity required for the Manufacture of any Product, will take all commercially reasonable steps to (i) procure adequate quantities of Materials from Third Party suppliers reasonably acceptable to Vericel, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill all Binding Orders for Product.\n\n(b) Prior to a Second Source commencing supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of (i) any Materials required to Manufacture Product or (ii) Product, MediWound will allocate the available Materials to the Manufacture of Product for sale to Vericel and will allocate the available Product for sale to Vericel, in each case ((i) or (ii)), to the extent any Binding Orders then in place prior to allocating such materials to the Manufacture of any other product (including EscharEx), or for any entity other than Vericel.\n\n(c) After a Second Source commences supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of Materials or Product, MediWound will allocate to Vericel its pro rata share of MediWound's supply of the same in a manner no less favorable than those of its equivalently situated customers or MediWound's own similarly situated products.\n\n12 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) The Parties will cooperate to discuss expansion plans, address capacity and any other product supply issues, including efficient use of resources, manufacturing schedules and shipping schedules.\n\n2.14 Supply Failures. In the event that MediWound becomes aware of the existence of a situation that may lead to a Supply Failure, then MediWound shall promptly (and in no event later than [***] from the date of such awareness) notify Vericel of the particular circumstances. MediWound and Vericel shall promptly discuss how to resolve such circumstances in an effort to avoid or mitigate such potential Supply Failure. MediWound shall investigate the root cause of the anticipated Supply Failure and prepare and provide to Vericel a Remediation Plan within [***] of MediWound's notice to Vericel. If the Remediation Plan is acceptable to Vericel, and MediWound is able to reasonably assure Vericel of MediWound's ability to Manufacture Product and, thereby, (a) avoid a Supply Failure or (b) supply Product in accordance with the Rolling Forecast within [***], then MediWound shall continue to Manufacture Product for Vericel. In all other cases, Vericel shall be permitted to take such measures as are reasonably determined in good faith by Vericel to ensure the supply of Product to the marketplace including cancelling or revising outstanding Purchase Orders and, at Vericel's option, Vericel's obligations under Section 2.8(a), (b) and (c) shall be deemed terminated.\n\nARTICLE 3  COMPLIANCE, QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL\n\n3.1 Certificates of Analysis; Release. MediWound shall perform, or cause to be performed testing and other activities on each Batch of Product Manufactured pursuant to this Agreement before delivery to Vericel or Vericel's designated Affiliate or contractor and consistent with the testing and procedures specified in the Quality Agreement.

Vericel's and its Affiliates', Sublicensees' and Distributors' costs (including internal costs of Vericel) associated with any such Recall shall be borne solely by Vericel (including refunds to customers); provided, however, that all out of pocket expenses associated with a Recall (including those of Vericel and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors and refunds to customers) shall be borne solely by MediWound to the extent such Recall (a) arises from or is caused directly by any breach by MediWound of this Agreement, the License Agreement or the Quality Agreement, or MediWound's or any of its Affiliates', Suppliers' or subcontractors' negligence or willful misconduct; or (b) resulting directly from MediWound's failure to supply Product that conforms to the applicable Product Warranty. MediWound shall cooperate in the implementation of any Recall of Product in the Territory, as required by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Vericel and, for such a Recall, the cost of such cooperation shall be at Vericel's reasonable\n\n15 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nexpense (except to the extent the Recall results from the matters described in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b)).\n\n3.8 Quality Agreement. Each Party shall perform the duties required of it pursuant to a quality agreement to be entered into by the Parties within [***] of the execution of this Agreement (the \"Quality Agreement\"). To the extent the Quality Agreement either conflicts with this Agreement or is silent on an issue addressed, this Agreement shall control, except to the extent the matter is strictly a quality matter, in which event the Quality Agreement shall supersede this Agreement solely with respect to such quality matter.\n\nARTICLE 4 CHANGES\n\n4.1 Changes. MediWound shall not change the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the Manufacture of Product for supply to Vericel for the Territory hereunder except as expressly permitted pursuant to this Article 4. Each Party shall notify the other Party of any change in the Regulatory Standards applicable to the Manufacturing of Product for the supply to Vericel for the Territory that could reasonably affect the obligations of MediWound under this Agreement. All changes shall include an assessment of the need for regulatory submission and approval by a method to be defined in the Quality Agreement. The applicable notification period for any change or proposed change by a Party to the Manufacturing process or Specifications for a Product or Key Materials, the Facility and other Manufacturing changes (the \"Change Notification Period\") is set forth on Schedule 4.1.\n\n4.2 Changes to Facility. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 2.6 and this Article 4, MediWound shall not perform any change of any part of any Facility, change the physical location within the Facility for Manufacturing any Products or change the Facility at which the Manufacturing of any Products takes place, if such change would reasonably be expected to (a) impact the Regulatory Approval for one or more of the Products or any regulatory compliance program; or (b) result in inability (permanent or temporary) of MediWound to Manufacture, supply or otherwise perform its obligations per Vericel's Rolling Forecast in accordance with this Agreement. For any change in the Facility at which the Manufacturing of any Products takes place, MediWound shall (i) give Vericel notice within the applicable Change Notification Period, and (ii) provide Vericel a plan for avoiding any interruption in supply that may result from such change. In the event of a \"Major\" change to the Facility (as detailed in Schedule 4.1), such change will be treated in accordance with Section 2.6(b).\n\n4.3 Discretionary Manufacturing Changes. Vericel may propose changes to the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the supply of Product to Vericel for the Territory that are not Regulatory Changes (any such change, a \"Discretionary Manufacturing Change\"). If agreed to by MediWound, MediWound or its Suppliers will use commercially reasonable efforts to make such proposed changes, and Vericel will bear [***] of the costs associated with such changes. MediWound may propose changes to the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the supply of Product for the Territory that are not Regulatory Changes. MediWound shall propose any such Discretionary Manufacturing Change in accordance with the applicable\n\n16 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Notification Period prior to the proposed implementation. [***]. Vericel shall, within [***] of receipt of MediWound's notice, notify MediWound in writing whether Vericel accepts or rejects the proposed change, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless consultations with regulatory authorities are required to assess the impact of such proposed change.\n\n4.4 Regulatory Changes.\n\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision under this Agreement to the contrary, if either Party receives notice, or is otherwise informed of, any change to the Manufacturing process or Specifications for a Product or Key Materials, the Facility or any change that has an impact of the obligations of Vericel or MediWound under this Agreement that is required by applicable Law or that is otherwise required by any applicable Regulatory Authority (any such change, a \"Regulatory Change\"), such Party shall promptly deliver notice thereof to the other Party. Within the applicable Change Notification Period, MediWound shall notify Vericel in writing of MediWound's good faith and reasonable determination as to (i) whether MediWound is technically able to comply with such Regulatory Change, (ii) whether the Regulatory Change would adversely affect MediWound's ability to timely manufacture and supply any Product supplied hereunder and (iii) the costs to implement such Regulatory Change. MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Key Material Suppliers to provide such notice of any Regulatory Change to MediWound or Vericel.\n\n(b) If MediWound determines it is technically unable to comply with the Regulatory Change at the Facility in the timeframe required by the applicable Regulatory Authority, then, in MediWound's discretion, it shall have the right to transfer the Manufacturing of the applicable Product to an alternative facility of MediWound that is qualified and approved for Manufacturing such Product in accordance with this Agreement, if available. In the event MediWound is unable to supply Product as a result of such Regulatory Change, Vericel, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to source all or any portion of Vericel's requirements of the applicable Product, until MediWound regains the ability to supply Product, from a Third Party, including from the Second Source. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if as a result of a Regulatory Change, MediWound is unable to Manufacture and supply a Product to Vericel, Vericel shall be entitled to source such Product, until MediWound regains the ability to supply Product, from a Third Party or Second Source in accordance with this Section 4.4(b), in which case MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Vericel with reasonable technical assistance with regard to transferring the technology relating to the Product to such Third Party, and the Parties shall discuss the allocation of such costs related to such transfer, including MediWound's expenses and any incremental costs of supply of such Product and Materials from such Third Party consistent with Schedule 4.5.\n\n(c) If MediWound determines it is technically able to implement a Regulatory Change required by a Regulatory Authority in the Territory, the costs for such Regulatory Change shall be borne by Vericel consistent with Schedule 4.5.\n\n17 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Ongoing Regulatory Assistance. Within [***] following Vericel's request, MediWound shall provide technical data and assistance in answering Vericel's questions (a) for regulatory filings and for process changes initiated by MediWound at no cost to Vericel, (b) for process changes initiated by Vericel at the cost of Vericel for the applicable number of hours at a Full Time Equivalent rate described in Schedule 4.5, (c) for new regulatory registrations, which shall be at Vericel's cost, and (d) for periodic regulatory reporting and questions from regulatory authorities, which shall be at the cost of Vericel.\n\nARTICLE 5  PRICE AND PAYMENT TERMS\n\n5.1 Supply Price. On a Product-by-Product basis, the price payable in U.S. Dollars by Vericel for supply of such Product for a given Calendar Year shall be as set forth on a per unit basis on Exhibit A (with respect to each Product, the \"Supply Price\"), which shall be updated on a Calendar Year basis in accordance with Section 5.2 below.\n\n5.2 Price Mechanics.\n\n(a) Beginning on [***] (each, a \"Re-Pricing Date\"), MediWound may annually increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.2. MediWound may increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year if the United States Producer Price Index (Chemical Manufacturing) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the \"PPI\") [***] and (b) in the event the PPI [***]. MediWound shall give Vericel at least [***] prior written notice of any such adjustment to the Supply Price.\n\n(b) In addition to the foregoing price adjustment mechanism, MediWound may propose an adjustment to the Supply Price to reflect changes that substantially affect MediWound's costs or ability to supply Product. MediWound shall provide Vericel with written notice of such changes and its proposed adjustment and provide appropriate documentation demonstrating that the price adjustment is required. Following Vericel's receipt of such notice and documentation, the Parties will engage in good faith discussions to negotiate a mutually agreed upon adjustment to the Supply Price, if any.\n\n(c) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the adjusted Supply Price will be the Supply Price for the next applicable Purchase Order placed after Vericel's receipt of notification of the adjusted Supply Price, and shall apply to each Purchase Order placed thereafter until the next adjustment is made (if any) in accordance with the above mechanism.\n\n5.3 Cost Savings. Either Party may propose changes to any Manufacturing process in order to obtain efficiencies and cost savings in such process (\"Cost Savings Change\"). The proposing Party shall submit to the other Party a proposal detailing the Cost Savings Change, the implementation of such Cost Savings Change, and the analysis of the expected efficiencies and cost savings from such Cost Savings Change. If Vericel proposes a Cost Savings Change and (a) MediWound determines it is technically able to implement the Cost Savings Change, (b) the Cost Savings Change would not materially adversely affect the applicable Facility, and (c) Vericel agrees to pay the costs to implement such Costs Saving Change as an Additional Service Fee,\n\n18 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nMediWound shall agree to implement such proposed change which MediWound shall not unreasonably decline to implement. If MediWound proposes a Cost Savings Change and the Parties agree to its implementation, (i) Vericel shall pay MediWound the agreed amount to implement such change as an Additional Service Fee prior to the implementation of such Cost Savings Change; and (ii) MediWound shall make its reasonable commercial efforts to implement such Cost Savings Change pursuant to a mutually agreed upon schedule. In the event cost savings are actually achieved, then the cost saving will be [***] between the Parties (i.e. [***] of the cost savings shall be added to the new discounted Supply Price).\n\n5.4 Payments. Unless specified otherwise, any payment to be made by Vericel under this Agreement shall be made within [***] from date of invoice. It is hereby agreed that the invoice with respect to any shipment will be issued upon the delivery date. The Parties' respective rights and responsibilities under Sections 5.6.5 and 5.6.6 of the License Agreement shall apply as such Section pertains to the Parties' performance under this Agreement, and are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n5.5 Late Payments. Any payments due under this Agreement shall be due on such date as specified in this Agreement and, in the event such date is not a Business Day, then the next succeeding Business Day. In the event that any payment due under this Agreement is not made when due, the amount due shall accrue interest beginning on the [***] following the date on which such payment was due, calculated at the [***] for the due date, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law, calculated from the due date until paid in full. Each payment made after the due date shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall have recourse to any other remedy available at law or in equity with respect to any delinquent payment, subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n\n5.6 Taxes. Vericel shall be responsible for the payment of any value added or similar tax (but excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any tax on the income of MediWound) on the Products delivered by MediWound to Vericel, to the extent such taxes are itemized and included on a valid invoice and required to be collected from Vericel under applicable Law. In addition, in the event any payments made by Vericel pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the Laws or regulations of any jurisdiction or Governmental Authority, Vericel shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of MediWound to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations; such amounts payable to MediWound shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld; and Vericel shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and transmit to MediWound an official tax certificate or other evidence of such tax obligations together with proof of payment from the relevant Governmental Authority of all amounts deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under applicable Laws or regulations to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, MediWound. Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party in claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any relevant agreement or treaty which is in effect. The Parties shall discuss applicable mechanisms for minimizing such taxes to the extent possible in compliance with applicable Laws. Vericel will provide MediWound with reasonable assistance to enable MediWound to recover such taxes as permitted by applicable Laws or regulations.\n\n19 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 6 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS\n\n6.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties.

Each Party will notify the other Party in writing in the event it becomes aware of a claim for which indemnification may be sought hereunder. In the event that any Third Party asserts a claim or other proceeding (including any governmental investigation) with respect to any matter for which a Party (the \"Indemnified Party\") is entitled to indemnification hereunder (a \"Third Party Claim\"), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Party obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") thereof; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.\n\n(b) Control. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any Third Party Claim, to assume direction and control of the defense, litigation, settlement, appeal or other disposition of the Third Party Claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment that is sought, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks solely monetary damages and (iii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the Third Party Claim in full (the conditions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above are collectively referred to as the \"Litigation Conditions\"). Within [***] after the Indemnifying Party has given notice to the Indemnified Party of its exercise of its right to defend a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give notice to the Indemnifying Party of any objection thereto based upon the Litigation Conditions. If the Indemnified Party reasonably so objects, the Indemnified Party shall continue to defend the Third Party Claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, until such time as\n\n22 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch objection is withdrawn. If no such notice is given, or if any such objection is withdrawn, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to assume direction and control of such defense, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. During such time as the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate, and shall cause its Affiliates and agents to cooperate upon request of the Indemnifying Party, in the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim, including by furnishing such records, information and testimony and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may reasonably be requested by the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Conditions or does not notify the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's intent to defend any Third Party Claim within [***] after notice thereof, the Indemnified Party may (without further notice to the Indemnifying Party) undertake the defense thereof with counsel of its choice and at the Indemnifying Party's expense (including reasonable, out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and costs and expenses of enforcement or defense). The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to join in (including the right to conduct discovery, interview and examine witnesses and participate in all settlement conferences), but not control, at its own expense, the defense of any Third Party Claim that the other party is defending as provided in this Agreement.\n\n(c) Settlement. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any compromise or settlement that commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third Party Claim involves equitable or other non-monetary relief, but shall not have the right to settle such Third Party Claim to the extent such Third Party Claim involves monetary damages without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall not make any admission of liability in respect of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, and the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate liabilities arising from such Third Party Claim.\n\n7.5 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES, AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF PRODUCT HEREUNDER), EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n7.6 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE, SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. [***].\n\n23 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7 Insurance. For the duration of this Agreement and for a period of [***] following its termination, each Party agrees to obtain and maintain, during the Term, commercial general liability insurance, including product liability insurance, with reputable and financially secure insurance carriers (or pursuant to a program of self-insurance reasonably satisfactory to the other Party) to cover its indemnification obligations under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, as applicable, in each case with limits of not less than [***] per occurrence and in the aggregate. Insurance shall be procured with carriers having an A.M. Best Rating of A-VII or better.\n\nARTICLE 8  TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n8.1 Term. The term of this Agreement will commence upon the Effective Date and will continue until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated or extended under this Article 8 (the \"Initial Term\"). At least twenty-four (24) months from the end of the Initial Term, Vericel shall provide MediWound notice whether Vericel elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement by an additional twenty four (24) months. After the Initial Term (including any extension thereto made in accordance with the preceding sentence), the Agreement may be extended on a yearly basis up to ten (10) years at Vericel's sole discretion, with renewal notice to be provided to MediWound no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiry of any yearly extension (the \"Renewal Term\", and the Initial Term, together with the Renewal Term, if any, the \"Term\"); provided that unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Term of this Agreement (including the Initial Term, any extension of the Initial Term and any Renewal Terms) shall be no more than fifteen (15) years in total.\n\n8.2 Automatic Termination. This Agreement will automatically immediately terminate in the event of the expiration or termination of the License Agreement.\n\n8.3 Termination for Breach. Subject to the provisions of Article 10 below, either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety if the other Party materially breaches a material provision and does not cure such breach, or does not take reasonable steps required under the circumstances to cure such breach going forward, within [***] after receiving notice of the breach.\n\n8.4 Termination by Vericel. Following the Initial Term, Vericel may, without penalty or prejudice to any other rights or remedies Vericel may have, in its sole discretion terminate or reduce the scope of any individual activities contemplated by this Agreement or any Additional Service or with respect to any Product or terminate this Agreement as a whole with or without cause, upon [***] prior written notice of such termination or reduction (which such written notice may be provided during the Initial Term).\n\n8.5 Termination by MediWound. Following the Initial Term, MediWound may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to Vericel upon on at least [***] advanced written notice (or such longer period of time as reasonably necessary to avoid a supply disruption) if MediWound determines to cease Manufacturing the applicable Product for the Territory, but in such case MediWound will reasonably cooperate with Vericel to enable Vericel to establish its own source for the Product (including, to the extent requested by Vericel and within\n\n24 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nMediWound's ability to do so, by transferring MediWound's applicable Third Party manufacturing relationships to Vericel).\n\n8.6 Effects of Termination. Any expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not affect any claims that have accrued or outstanding obligations or payments due hereunder prior to such termination or expiration, nor shall it prejudice any other remedies that the Parties may have under this Agreement. In addition, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement:\n\n(a) if Vericel terminates the Agreement for breach or MediWound terminates in accordance with Section 8.5, Vericel shall have the option of [***]\n\n(b) Vericel shall pay to MediWound: (i) all amounts outstanding and remaining to be paid for Product supplied prior to such expiration or termination or under any other obligation under the Agreement; (ii) all amounts for Product in the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders prior to the expiration or termination, provided that MediWound delivers such Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) all amounts representing the purchase by MediWound of Materials in reliance upon the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders (if MediWound is unable to cancel (without incurring any costs) or otherwise use such Materials); and (iv) all amounts representing remaining inventory of Product and all Product work in process undertaken in accordance with the Binding Forecasts or Binding Orders or undertaken otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n(c) Following expiration of the Royalty Term (as defined in the License Agreement) for any Licensed Product in a given country, the license granted to Vericel under Section 9.1 of this Agreement with respect to such Licensed Product in such country shall automatically become fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free.\n\n8.7 Survival. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the following terms of this Agreement shall survive: Article 1, Sections 3.2, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, Article 7, Article 8, Sections 9.1 and 9.2 (except in the event of termination of the License Agreement under Section 9.2, 9.3 or 9.4 thereof), Section 9.3, Article 10, and Article 11.\n\nARTICLE 9 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n9.1 Manufacturing License Grant. Subject to the terms herein, MediWound hereby grants to Vericel a non-exclusive, sublicensable (subject to Section 4.2 of the License Agreement) license under the MediWound Technology and MediWound's interest in the Joint Technology, to Manufacture and have Manufactured Licensed Products in the Territory for use in the Field in the Territory.\n\n9.2 Trademarks License Grant. MediWound hereby grants to Vericel an exclusive (even as to MediWound), sublicensable, royalty- free, fully paid-up, license in the Territory to use the Licensed Trademarks (as defined in the License Agreement) and a non- exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, license to use the MediWound name and trademark, in\n\n25 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\neach case, in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory. All uses of the Licensed Trademarks by Vericel (and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors) in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory shall be in accordance with Regulatory Approvals and all applicable Laws and MediWound's quality control guidelines for the Licensed Trademarks, as may be amended from time to time. Vericel (and its Affiliates) shall only use the Licensed Trademarks licensed hereunder in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in the Territory. Vericel shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, Sublicensee and Distributors not to) use such Licensed Trademarks to identify, or in connection with the marketing of, any other products.\n\n9.1 Ownership. Ownership of all inventions and discoveries made by the Parties in the course of Manufacturing and supply of the Product hereunder (including Manufacture and supply of Product) shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 10  FORCE MAJEURE\n\n10.1 Excusing Performance. Neither Party shall be liable for the failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing Party, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, embargoes, shortages, epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorist acts, insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances involving the workforce of any Third Party, or acts of God (a \"Force Majeure Event\"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event will not excuse or prevent a failure of MediWound to deliver Product from being deemed a \"Supply Failure\" or otherwise limit Vericel's rights, to the extent applicable, under Section 2.13.\n\n10.2 Notice of Force Majeure Event. A Party claiming a right to be excused from performance under Section 10.1 shall immediately notify the other Party in writing of the extent of its inability to perform, which notice shall specify the Force Majeure Event and the estimated likely period of time during which its performance will be affected.\n\n10.3 Resumption; Termination. A non-performing Party as a result of a Force Majeure Event shall use reasonable best efforts, at its own expense, to eliminate the Force Majeure Event and to mitigate the effect of such cause and resume performance under this Agreement, in each case, as soon as practicable and for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues. Further, consistent with diligent risk management practices, MediWound will keep current a risk management program. If MediWound is affected by any Force Majeure Event, MediWound agrees to perform its obligations under this Section 10.3 to mitigate the effect thereof and resume performance under this Agreement in the same manner as MediWound would use to resolve any similar disruptions affecting its own products (including EscharEx). MediWound shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the impact of the Force Majeure Event shall not be relatively greater for Vericel than it is for MediWound with respect to MediWound's products (including EscharEx).\n\n26 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 11  MISCELLANEOUS\n\n11.1 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as follows: (a) such Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, provided that the assignee shall expressly agree to be bound by such Party's obligations under this Agreement and that such Party shall remain liable for all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (b) either Party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a Third Party in connection with a permitted assignment or other permitted transfer of the License Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1. This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties and the name of a Party appearing herein shall be deemed to include the names of such Party's successors and permitted assigns to the extent necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 11.1 shall be void.\n\n11.2 Further Actions. Each Party agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver such further instruments, and to do all such other acts, as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of the Agreement.\n\n11.3 Notices.

If any clause or portion thereof in this Agreement is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same shall not affect any other portion of this Agreement, as it is the intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall be construed in such fashion as to maintain its existence, validity and enforceability to the greatest extent possible.

TouchStar shall defend any action brought against Reseller   based on an allegation that any TouchStar Software infringes a United   States or foreign Patent, Copyright, or Trademark, and TouchStar shall   pay all costs and damages made in settlement or awarded as a result of   any such action.

The expiration or   termination of this Agreement shall not relieve TouchStar of its   continuing obligation to ship TouchStar Software pursuant to any   purchase orders accepted by TouchStar prior to the notice of   termination, nor shall it relieve Reseller of its continuing   obligation to accept and pay for such TouchStar Software; PROVIDED,   HOWEVER, that with respect to all TouchStar Software shipped after any   notice of termination, Reseller shall make payment prior to shipment   on terms and conditions and by means satisfactory to TouchStar,   notwithstanding any credit terms that may have been available to   Reseller prior to such notice of termination.\n\n     9.6  LIABILITY UPON TERMINATION. TouchStar shall have no liability to   Reseller or any Other Reseller by reason of the termination or   expiration of this Agreement for compensation, reimbursement, or   damages of any kind, including any loss of prospective profits on   anticipated sales, loss of goodwill, or investments made in reliance   on this Agreement. Reseller acknowledges that it has received no   assurances from TouchStar that its business relationship with   TouchStar will continue beyond the term established in this Agreement,   or that it will obtain any anticipated amounts of profits in   connection with this Agreement, or that it will recoup its investment   in the promotion of the TouchStar Software.

However, these   provisions apply only to damages that are attributable to the   expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall not affect any   amount due\n\n       20\n\n  under this Agreement or the right of either party to seek damages   directly attributable to any breach.\n\n10.

Within [***] ([***]) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.\n\n11.3.2 If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith.\n\n11.3.3 The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. 35\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim or consent to any judgment in respect thereof that does not include a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party or adversely affects the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n11.4 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, OR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of Aimmune's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written evidence of such insurance prior to commencement of this Agreement and upon expiration of any one coverage. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.\n\nARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n12.1 Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.1 The Parties agree that during the Term, and for a period of [***] ([***]) years thereafter, a Party receiving Confidential Information of the other Party will (X) maintain in confidence such Confidential Information to the same extent such Party maintains its own proprietary information of similar kind and value, and, in any event, no less than a reasonable standard of care, (Y) not disclose such Confidential Information to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as otherwise expressly permitted below, and (Z) not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except those permitted by this Agreement. 36\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAs used herein, \"Confidential Information\" means all Know-How and other information and materials received by either Party from the other Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.

Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Party's intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.3 Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential Information of the other Party only to (i) the receiving Party's attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party's Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, actual or potential acquirers, sublicensees and subdistributors of such Affiliates, who have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the 37\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nactivities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential Information as required under this Section 12.1.\n\nFor clarity, either Party may disclose without any limitation such Party's U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions relating to such Party that are based on or derived from this Agreement, as well as all materials of any kind (including opinions, other tax analyses, or a complete copy of this Agreement and any amendments thereto) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.\n\n12.1.4 Each Party acknowledges that a Party in breach of any of its obligations under this Section 12.1 shall cause the non-breaching Party irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of bond or other security.\n\n12.2 Publicity. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties shall each issue the applicable press release in the form attached hereto as Schedule 12.2, with respect to this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, any press releases or other public statements or disclosures regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to the express prior written consent of each of the Parties; provided that a disclosure shall be permitted without the other Party's consent to the extent that it does not contain information beyond that included in a prior disclosure approved in writing by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party's counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although, prior to any such legally required disclosure by a Party, such Party shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to give the other Party reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.\n\n12.3 Securities Filings.

Except for disclosures permitted under this Agreement, if Xencor, its Affiliates, or its employee(s) or consultant(s) wishes to make a publication or presentation specific to the Product or which otherwise may reasonably contain Know-How, or other intellectual property, of Aimmune, Xencor must receive written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, from Aimmune at least [***] ([***]) days prior to submission for publication or presentation.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, neither Party shall use the name of the other Party in relation to this transaction in any public announcement, press release or other public document without the written consent of such other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that subject to Section 12.3, either Party may use the name of the other Party in any document filed with any Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority, including the Securities and Exchange Commission or the rules of any securities exchange.\n\n12.6 Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information. Each Party shall have a response plan in place for any disclosure of Confidential Information that is not authorized or otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Such plan shall include considerations of, among other things, notification, remediation and retrieval. In the event that a Party becomes aware of an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, then such Party shall notify the other Party promptly in writing.\n\n12.7 Prior CDA. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this ARTICLE 12 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties dated [***].

(Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb\u00ae7195 from Xencor, Inc.\n\nXmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) programs, including PALFORZIA\u2122 , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies.\n\n\"As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,\" said Jayson Dallas, M.D., President and CEO of Aimmune. \"In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.\"\n\n\"Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,\" said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xencor. \"AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238 newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones \u2014 beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial \u2014 and is eligible to receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.\n\nAbout AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb\u00ae7195)\n\nAIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nin patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.\n\nAbout Aimmune\n\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for patients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company's Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) approach is intended to provide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with defined, precise amounts of key allergens. Aimmune has one FDA-approved medicine for peanut allergy and other investigational therapies in development to treat other food allergies.

Cisco Customer Service may accept a Purchase Order even if some of the information required by Section 4.1 above is missing or incomplete. In relation to Services, Cisco will confirm acceptance of a Purchase Order for Services by issuing a list of Products covered by such Services (the \"Equipment List\").\n\n4.3 Distributor may defer Product shipment for up to [*****] from the original shipping date scheduled by Cisco, provided written or electronic notice (issued, in either case, by an authorized representative of Distributor) is received by Cisco at least [*****] days before the originally scheduled shipping date.

[*****] As provided in sub- section 3.2, in its discretion, Cisco may choose to make products or services which are on the Global Price List but not on the Value Added Distributor Price List available to Distributor. The prices for such products or services will be provided by Cisco to Distributor at the time Cisco makes such products available.\n\n6.2 Upon and subject to credit approval by Cisco, payment terms shall be [*****] days from shipping date. All payments shall be made in the currency in which the Price List is quoted for the applicable Purchase Order [*****].\n\n6.3 The purchase price does not include any federal, state or local taxes, or sales, use, excise, ad valorem, value-add, withholding or other taxes or duties that may be applicable to the purchase of Products. When Cisco has the legal obligation to collect such taxes, the appropriate amount shall be added to Distributor's invoice and paid by Distributor, unless Distributor provides Cisco with a valid tax exemption certificate prior to issuance of a purchase order. Such certificate must be in a form authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n6.4 Distributor is free to determine its minimum resale prices unilaterally. Distributor understands that neither Cisco nor any employee or representative of Cisco may give any special treatment (favorable or unfavorable) to Distributor as a result of Distributor's selection of minimum resale prices. No employee or representative of Cisco or anyone else has any authority to determine what Distributor's minimum resale prices for the Products must be, or to limit Distributor's pricing discretion with respect to the Products and Services.\n\n6.5 In the event any provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement between Distributor and Cisco require that Cisco grant credits to Distributor's account, Cisco will grant such credit to Distributor's account. [*****]. Cisco will only consider debit memos initially received from Distributor during the time period associated with such request, as set forth herein.\n\nAll debit memos Distributor submits to Cisco will be submitted using any method identified in 25.8, or as otherwise agreed between the parties.\n\n6.6 Except as stated in Sections 7 (Price Protection), 12 (Inventory Balance), 13 (Return of Obsolete Product), 18 (Term and Termination) or as otherwise stated herein, for all price adjustment related credits requested by the Distributor to be granted by Cisco, the\n\n6.7 Distributor must make the initial credit request to Cisco, in writing, within [*****] of the underlying point of sale transaction. Any initial credit requests submitted by the Distributor to Cisco greater than [*****] after the underlying point of sale transaction will not be honored by Cisco and Cisco will not grant such credit to Distributor.\n\n7.0 PRICE PROTECTION. 7.1 Definition: For purposes of this Section 7.0, Products \"In-Transit\" shall be defined as all Products with a particular Cisco part number shipped by Cisco to Distributor in the [*****] day period prior to the date on which Cisco announces a general price decrease for Products with such part number, excluding those Products which Distributor has received into its inventory during such [*****] day period.\n\n7.2 In the event Cisco puts into effect a general price decrease for any Product from the Value Added Distributor Price List, Cisco will provide to Distributor a price credit on any such Product on order, In Transit or in Distributor's inventory as of the effective date of the price decrease, provided that the price credit for such Product in inventory or In Transit shall not exceed the dollar value of shipments of that Product (measured by the appropriate Cisco product number) to Distributor over the preceding [*****]. Cisco will credit Distributor's account with an amount equal to the number of units of such Product in Distributor's inventory and In Transit on the effective date of a price decrease multiplied by the difference between the net price paid and the new net price. Distributor will have [*****] from the effective date of the price change to exercise protection under this program by issuing a request for credit memo with supporting documentation to Cisco. Claims for price protection submitted more than [*****] from the effective date of a price decrease will be rejected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Product on order will receive an automatic retroactive price credit. The only inventoried Product covered under this price protection clause is Product which has been identified by Distributor to Cisco in the daily inventory reports required in sub-sub-section 17.2.2, excluding any Third-Party\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nSourced Product.

For purposes of this Agreement, all references to \"Customer\" or \"You\" therein shall refer to Distributor.\n\n9.2 Distributor shall notify Cisco promptly of any breach or suspected breach of the EULA and further agrees that it will, at Cisco's request, assist Cisco in efforts to preserve Cisco's intellectual property rights including pursuing an action against any breaching third parties.\n\n10.

A transfer occurs when: (1) the original or authorized subsequent licensee tries to convey or reassign its right to use the Software to another entity, or (2) the original lessor of Cisco used hardware (including bundled Software) (\"Hardware\") tries to reassign the original lessee's right to use the Software to another lessee, or the lessor tries to convey or reassign its right to lease the Hardware and Software bundle to another lessor. A rental would be treated the same as the lease situation as described in item 2 above.\n\nThis policy applies to all Software whether Standalone or Embedded. Standalone Software is Software which is not required to operate the Hardware upon which it resides (i.e., ICSG software such as call center, unified messaging, network management software). Embedded Software is Software which is incorporated into the Hardware and is required for its operation (i.e., operating system software, certain features of IOS).\n\nPolicy:\n\nCisco's policy is that Software, whether Standalone or Embedded, is not transferable, except where a listed exception below applies, and except, of course, where Cisco's contract expressly allows it. Any other transfers will require the payment of a new license fee (see Global Price List). For products where there is no separate line item for the Software (i.e. the prices for both the Hardware and Software are bundled), and therefore, a fee cannot be determined, an exception will be made to allow for the transfer without the customer being required to obtain a new license (the customer may be required to pay an inspection fee), if (A) Software to be transferred (i) will be under a support contract provided by either Cisco or a Cisco\u200b\u2010 authorized support partner or (ii) is still supported by Cisco; or (B) approval from the theatre Sales Controller has been obtained.\n\nUse of the Software will be governed by either the original license terms and conditions in place between Cisco and the original Software licensee or by the new license between Cisco and the new user. Cisco may withhold its consent to any transfer not conforming to this policy.\n\nLicense Fee:\n\nThe License Fee is generally the same amount as the fee charged for a new license or a portion of the fee of a new license, unless otherwise noted on the Global Price List.\n\nIt is the obligation of the transferor to obtain Cisco's consent and/or a new license before the transfer occurs.\n\nExceptions:\n\nProvided the conditions of transfer are met as set forth below, the follow exceptions apply to the prohibition against transfer without written approval and payment of the applicable fee. These exceptions may be overridden by express terms in an applicable licensing agreement governing the transferability of Special License Software (Special License Software is the term now used in our templates to refer to ICSG Product)\n\nAffiliate: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to its Affiliate. An Affiliate is another entity where at least 50.1% of its voting power is owned or controlled by the transferring entity or where as least 50.1% of the transferring entity's voting power is owned or controlled by the transferee.\n\nMerger or Acquisition: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to the purchaser of all or substantially all of the capital stock of the transferor or all or substantially all of the assets of that portion of the transferor's business to which those licenses pertain. Lease: In a leasing situation where the original lessee/customer would like to buy out the equipment from the leasing company during or at the end of the lease term, the original lessee/customer may retain the license without paying a new License Fee, provided leasing company gives Cisco prior written notice. Also, if the original lessee/customer defaults under the lease and the leasing company takes the equipment back before the end of the lease term, the leasing company may transfer the license to the another lessee for the remainder of the original lease term, without paying Cisco a License Fee, upon 30 days' prior written notice to Cisco, or as soon as practicable if the equipment is re-leased before such 30- day period. If the new lease term is in\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nexcess of the original lease term, the leasing company is expected to pay Cisco a new License Fee on or before the expiration date of the original lease term. [NOTE: In the situation where a leasing company leases Cisco equipment to Customer A for a specified term and at the end of the lease term, the leasing company desires to lease the same equipment to Customer B, leasing company may not transfer the license without obtaining a new license from Cisco.)].\n\nOutsource: Customer desires to outsource the operation, support and maintenance of its network to a third party (e.g. EDS) (\"Third-Party Service Provider\"), for the benefit of that customer. As part of the outsourcing, customer transfers all of its rights, title and interest to the assets, including certain Cisco products and software licenses, to the Third-Party Service Provider. Customer may transfer the license to the Third-Party Service Provider solely for the purposes of providing services to Customer upon 30 days' prior written notice to Cisco.\n\nAll notices should be sent to sw-license@cisco.com or as indicated in the agreement between Cisco and the customer or transferor, if any.\n\nConditions of Transfer:\n\nTransfers, in any event, shall only be allowed under the following conditions:\n\n\u25e6 The parties involved in the transfer are not in breach of the agreement governing the use of the Software or any other agreement with Cisco;\n\n\u25e6 Any additional services or charges incurred by Cisco as the result of any transfer shall be borne by the transferor and transferee; and\n\n\u25e6 The parties involved in the transfer shall provide written prior notice of a permitted transfer to Cisco and the transferee shall, in a writing to Cisco, (i) assume all of the obligations of the transferor, and (ii) agree that transferee's use of the Software shall be governed by the terms of the then-current license agreement between Cisco and transferor or, at Cisco's sole discretion, by the terms of Cisco's then-current standard license agreement.\n\nQuestions?\n\nAny questions or comments regarding this policy should be sent to sw-license@cisco.com.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nEXHIBIT G\n\nCisco End of Life Policy\n\nProducts reach the end of their Product Life Cycle for a number of reasons. These reasons may be due to market demands, technology innovation and development driving changes in the product, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer technology. While this is an established part of the overall product life cycle, Cisco Systems recognizes that end-of-life milestones often prompt companies to review the way in which such end-of-sale and end-of-life milestones impact the Cisco products in their networks. With that in mind, we have set out below Cisco's end-of-life policy to help customers better manage their end-of-life transition and to understand the role that Cisco can play in helping to migrate to alternative Cisco platforms and technology.\n\nThe End of Life Policy only applies to End of Life and End of Sale announcements made in all Theaters on or after November 30, 2002 for all Cisco product lines. The Policy does not apply to product that is already subject to an End of Life and/or End of Sale announcement. The general policy guidelines are:\n\n1. As a general rule, Cisco will provide 6 months' notice of the affected product's end-of-sale date and/or the last day when the affected product can be ordered. This notice will appear on Cisco.com site (http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_end_of_life.html) and we encourage you to visit this site regularly as it contains useful information regarding Cisco's end-of-life program. Sign up to receive notification here: http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/FieldNoticeTool/field-notice\n\n2. Access to Cisco's Technical Assistance Center (TAC) will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for a period of 5 years from the end-of-sale date for hardware and operating system software issues and for a period of 3 years from the end-of-sale date for application software issues.\n\n3. Spares or replacement parts for hardware will be available for a period of 5 years from the end-of\u200b sale date. We will provide spares and replacement parts in accordance with our Return Materials Authorization (RMA) process.\n\n4. Software support will be as follows\n\na. For the first year following the end-of-sale date, we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds, or patches for critical bugs reported via the TAC or Cisco.com Web site.\n\nb. After the first year and for Operating System SW -where available- we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for a period of 4 years for operating system software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release to correct a reported problem.\n\nc. After the first year and for Application SW -where available - we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds or patches for a period of 2 years for application software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release to correct a reported problem.\n\n5. You will need to ensure that you have a current and fully paid support contract with Cisco. Please contact your Support Account Manager regarding fees payable during the end-of-life period so that we can support you right through the end-of-life transition period.\n\n6. Below are guidelines that should be followed to ensure that you receive effective support for the affected products within your network:\n\na. For hardware or software that is not covered under a service contract, customers may add the product(s) to a current contract or purchase a new contract until 12 months after the end-of-sale date.\n\nb. Service contracts that have not been renewed or have lapsed after 12 months of end-of\u200b sale date are not re-newable.\n\nc. Renewal of your service contract will generally be available until the last year of support, but will not extend\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nbeyond the last date of support.\n\nThe end-of-life milestones and Cisco commitments are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1. Standard Guideline for End-of-Life Milestones Milestone - 6 mos Day 0 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 year 5 Year\n\nEnd-of-sale date\n\nEnd-of-Sale Notice Period\n\nOperating System Software Maintenance Support See 4(a) See 4(b) above\n\nAdd or attach new service contracts\n\nRenew service contracts - for HW & Operating System SW\n\nHardware Repair or Replacement\n\nCustomer Service and Support of HW & Operating System SW (TAC access & support)\n\nApplication Software maintenance support See 4(a) See 4(c) above\n\nRenew service contracts - for Application SW\n\nHere is an explanation of some of the terms that we have used in this notice: End of Product Life Cycle: A process that guides the final business operations associated with the product life cycle. The end-of-life process consists of a series of technical and business milestones and activities that, once completed, make a product obsolete. Once obsolete, the product is not sold, manufactured, improved, repaired, maintained, or supported.\n\nEnd-of-sale date: The last date to order the product through Cisco point-of-sale mechanisms. The product is no longer for sale.\n\nHardware: The physical product and its physical components.\n\nOperating System Software: Cisco operating system software that runs on Cisco hardware Application software: Cisco software that requires the presence of some non-Cisco operating system software.\n\nSoftware Maintenance support: The time period that Cisco may release any software maintenance releases or bug fixes to the software product. After this date, Cisco Engineering will no longer develop, repair, maintain, or test the product software.\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019", "instructions": ["Highlight the parts (if any) of this contract related to \"Effective Date\" that should be reviewed by a lawyer.

If Pretzel  Time has fully  negotiated  a lease  agreement  for such location,  then  Franchisee  shall (1) obtain the  consent  of the  landlord  to execute such lease and execute such lease,  if applicable;  (2) execute  Pretzel Time's then current form of Satellite Unit Addendum  (containing  Pretzel Time's then  current  fees  and  expense  requirements)  and such  ancillary  documents (including guarantees) as are then customarily used by Pretzel Time in the grant of franchises for Pretzel Time Units as modified for use in connection  with the Site, as necessary, and (3) pay Pretzel Time's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in locating such additional  Site and negotiating the lease  agreement, all within ten (10) business days after Pretzel Time's delivery to Franchisee of the lease agreement and the franchise documents.\n\n If Franchisee  timely notifies  Pretzel Time in writing that Franchisee desires to develop and operate an additional  Pretzel Time Unit, such as a kiosk or cart,  within its Territory and Pretzel Time has not fully negotiated a lease agreement for such location, then Franchisee will have thirty (30) days in which to negotiate and deliver to Pretzel Time a lease agreement for such site in form for execution.  If Pretzel Time  disapproves  the lease agreement for failure to meet  Pretzel  Time's  requirements,  Franchisee  will have ten (10) days within which to negotiate  and deliver to Pretzel Time a revised  lease  agreement  for such  location  in form for  execution.  If  Pretzel  Time  approves  the  lease agreement  for such  location  as  meeting  Pretzel  Time's  requirements,  then Franchisee  will (1) execute  such lease  agreement;  (2) execute the  franchise documents;   and  (3)  pay  Pretzel  Time's  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred,  if any, in locating such  additional  Site and  negotiating the lease agreement,  all within ten (10) business days after Pretzel  Time's  delivery to Franchisee of the lease agreement and the franchise documents.\n\n 2.F.

The franchise fee is fully  earned  by  Pretzel  Time  upon the  payment  in full  thereof  and is nonrefundable   (except  as   specifically   provided  in  this   agreement)  as consideration for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in furnishing assistance and services to Franchisee  and for Pretzel  Time's lost or deferred  opportunity to franchise others,  and not as compensation for the use of the copyrighted works, Marks or Trade Dress.

The Royalty is not uniform as to  all  franchisees,  it is  fully  earned,  and  is  nonrefundable  in  any circumstance.  Franchisee  shall pay weekly by electronic  funds  transfer (ACH) without offset,  defalcation,  credit or deduction of any nature to Pretzel Time the royalty fee, the advertising  fund fee and all other amounts due and payable on each Wednesday for the immediately  preceding week. The Royalty shall be paid by electronic funds transfer from Franchisee's  general operating  account.  The Royalty is paid,  in part,  to  compensate  Pretzel  Time for  various  services provided  to  Franchisee  after the Unit opens,  including,  but not limited to, quality, service, and cleanliness inspections. Pretzel Time, upon written notice to  Franchisee,  shall  have the right to  change  the  timing  of  Franchisee's payments of Royalty  Fees and  Advertising  Fund Fees due under this  Agreement.

The transfer fee is non-refundable. The fee shall be due and payable by the current  Franchisee to Pretzel Time five (5) days prior to the transfer of the Franchise to the assignee.  Additionally,  the assignee  of the  Franchisee  shall pay  Pretzel  Time an  additional  amount of Twenty-Five  Thousand Dollars  ($25,000.00) (plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt Product is included),  for any  additional  units that are not existing  stores or the then current initial franchisee fee for traditional Pretzel Time Units.\n\n 4.F.     FEES FOR ADDITIONAL FRANCHISES.\n\n  In the event that Franchisee  meets Pretzel Time's  qualifications  to open  additional  Franchises at sites  acceptable to both Franchisee and Pretzel Time,  which  approval is at the sole  discretion of Pretzel  Time,  the initial franchisee  fee shall be the greater of FIVE THOUSAND  DOLLARS  ($5,000.00)(plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt  Product is included) or the then current fee for additional franchises set by Pretzel Time, at its sole discretion. The decision to grant an additional  franchise  location shall be in the sole  discretion of Pretzel Time and at no time does Pretzel Time promise or guarantee that additional franchises will be offered  or  approved.  Such  decisions  will be made on a  case-to-case basis,  based on  factors  including,  but not  limited to the  availability  of suitable locations,  quality of standards maintained in the Franchisee's current Units,   the  impact  of  additional   locations  upon  the  operations  of  the Franchisee's  current Units, the geographical  distance between the Franchisee's existing and proposed  location,  the business  plan of Pretzel  Time,  national contracts  with  major  corporations,  the  population  of  the  area  near  the prospective  site,  the quality of the site,  and other  economic  and  business factors.  Under no  circumstances  is  Franchisee  entitled to demand or require Pretzel Time to grant to Franchisee a Franchise or a similar variation thereof.\n\n 4.G.     FEES FOR RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.\n\n Franchisee  agrees that in consideration of the grant of the \"Successor Franchise\"  (defined in Section 5.A.),  Franchisee shall pay the current renewal fee as of the  date of  renewal  and  execute  a  general  release  in the  form prescribed  by Pretzel Time in  accordance  with Section 5.B. The renewal fee is due and payable thirty (30) days prior to the renewal day.\n\n 4.H.     PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER.\n\n Franchisee agrees to pay all Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due Pretzel Time for purchases by Franchisee from Pretzel Time or its Affiliates and other amounts which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel Time via  electronic  funds transfer from Franchisee's general account,  which shall be initiated by Pretzel Time and any transfer fees shall be paid by Franchisee  every  Wednesday for the preceding week based upon the Net Revenues.  Franchisee herein agrees to execute and complete all necessary  documentation required by Pretzel Time to permit the wire transfer to Pretzel Time (in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit E or such other form as Pretzel Time shall accept). Under this procedure, Franchisee shall authorize  Pretzel  Time to initiate  debit  entries  and/or  credit  correction entries  to  Franchisee's   general  operating  bank  account  for  payments  of Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement and any late or interest  charges due thereon.  Franchisee  shall make the funds\n\n\n\n\n\navailable to Pretzel Time for  withdrawal by  electronic  transfer no later than one day prior to the due date for payment therefor.  The Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees amount actually  transferred from Franchisee's  account shall be based on the Unit's Net Revenues  indicated on the reports  submitted by Franchisee as required  hereunder.  If Franchisee  has not reported the Unit's Net Revenues to Pretzel  Time  for any week as  required  herein,  then  Pretzel  Time  shall be authorized  to  debit  Franchisee's  account  in an  amount  equal  to the  fees transferred from Franchisee's  account for the last reporting period for which a report of the Unit's Net  Revenues  was  provided  to Pretzel  Time as  required hereunder.  If,  at any  time,  Pretzel  Time  determines  that  Franchisee  has under-reported the Unit's Net Revenues, or underpaid Royalty or Advertising Fund Fees or other  amounts  due  hereunder,  Pretzel  Time  shall be  authorized  to initiate  immediately a debit to Franchisee's  account in the appropriate amount in  accordance  with the foregoing  procedure,  plus interest as provided for in this  Agreement.  Any  overpayment  shall be  credited to  Franchisee's  account through a credit  effective  as of the first week after  Franchisee  and Pretzel Time  determine  that such credit is due.  Notwithstanding  any  designation  by Franchisee, Pretzel Time shall have the sole discretion to apply any payments by Franchisee to any past  indebtedness  of Franchisee  for Royalty or  Advertising Fund Fees,  purchases from Pretzel Time and/or its  Affiliates,  interest or any other indebtedness,  including,  without  limitation,  payment of rental sums in arrears for the Unit.\n\n 4.I.     LATE CHARGE AND INTEREST.\n\n To compensate Pretzel Time for the increased  administrative expense of handling late payments,  Pretzel Time may charge Franchisee a $50.00 late charge for each delinquent payment.  All Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due for  purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates,  and other amounts  which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  shall bear interest  after  their due date at a rate equal to the  lesser of: (1)  eighteen percent (18%) per annum for the number of days which such payment is due; or (2) the highest  applicable  legal rate  permitted  by  applicable  law.  Franchisee acknowledges  that this  Section  shall  not  constitute  Pretzel  Time's or its Affiliates' agreement to accept such payments after they are due or a commitment by Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  to extend  credit to or  otherwise  finance operation of the Unit.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Section  4.I., Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that his failure to pay all amounts when due shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.\n\n5.

FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO A SUCCESSOR FRANCHISE.\n\n Upon the expiration of the initial term of this  Agreement,  Franchisee shall  have the one time  right to obtain a  successor  franchise  to  operate a Pretzel  Time Unit at the Site (a  \"Successor  Franchise\")  for a single term of five (5) years  immediately  following the expiration of the initial term of the Franchise upon giving Pretzel Time six (6) months notice prior to the expiration of the then current term if:\n\n (1) Franchisee and its Owners have complied with this Agreement and any  amendment  during the initial  term of this  Agreement  in all material  respects; and\n\n (2) Franchisee  maintains  possession of the Site and agrees to remodel  and/or expand the Unit, add or replace equipment, furnishings, fixtures  and signs and  otherwise  modify  the Unit to bring it into  compliance  with   specifications  and  standards  then  applicable  under  new  or  Successor Franchises for Pretzel Time Units; or if Franchisee is unable  to maintain  possession  of the Site, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel  Time,  the Unit should be  relocated,  Franchisee  secures a substitute  site approved by Pretzel Time and agrees to develop  expeditiously such  substitute  site in compliance with  specifications  and standards then  applicable  under new or successor  franchises  for Pretzel Time units;  and\n\n (3) Pretzel  Time has not given notice of its election not to renew six  (6) months  prior to the  expiration  of the  initial  twenty (20) year  term; and\n\n (4)  Franchisee  is not in default of any material term or condition of  the lease  agreement,  or any other agreement  between Pretzel Time and  Franchisee; and\n\n (5) Franchisee executes Pretzel Time's then current Franchise Agreement  and  other  ancillary  agreements  required  and being  offered  to new  Franchisees on the date of renewal, which agreements shall supersede in  all respects this  Agreement and the terms of which may differ from the  terms of this Agreement,  including,  without limitation,  Royalty Fees  and  Advertising  Fund  Fees,  other  fees  and  charges,   performance  criteria,  and a provision which allows Pretzel Time and its Affiliates  to reserve  the right,  both within and  outside of the  Territory,  to  offer and sell at wholesale or retail, through channels of distribution  distinct  from  those  of a  Franchise,  Products  and  services  which  comprise,  or may in the  future  comprise a part of the  Pretzel  Time  System, which Products may be resold at retail to the general public by  such entities; and\n\n (6) Franchisee is in full  compliance  with Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual; and\n\n (7) On renewal,  Franchisee  agrees to pay the current renewal fee, the  Royalty and  Advertising  Fund fees specified in Pretzel Time's current\n\n\n\n\n\n Franchise  Agreement then being offered new  Franchisees on the date of  renewal; and\n\n (8) Franchisee shall execute general releases,  in form satisfactory to  Pretzel  Time,  of any and all  claims  against  Pretzel  Time  and its  Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents, successors  and assigns arising under this Agreement; and\n\n (10)   Franchisee   has  complied  with  Pretzel  Time's  then  current  qualification and training requirements.\n\n Following receipt of Franchisee's election to renew, Pretzel Time shall provide Franchisee with an execution copy of the form of Franchise  Agreement to be entered into for the renewal  term.  If the  Franchisee  does not execute and return the renewal Franchise Agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt,  then Franchisee  shall be deemed to have  withdrawn  its notice of renewal,  and this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the current term.\n\n Pretzel Time may, at its option, with reasonable cause and upon written notice,  elect not to renew the Franchise  Agreement.  Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee  of the  nonrenewal  not  less  than  six  (6)  months  prior  to the expiration  of the term of this  Agreement.  If  applicable  law  requires  that Pretzel Time give longer  notice to  Franchisee  prior to the  expiration of the term than is specified in the Franchise Agreement,  the Franchise Agreement will remain in effect on a  month-to-month  basis until the requisite notice has been given.\n\n 5.B.

Failure by Franchisee and its Owners to sign and deliver to Pretzel  Time,  such  agreements  and releases  within thirty (30) days after delivery  thereof to Franchisee shall be deemed an election by Franchisee not to obtain a Successor Franchise.\n\n 5.C.

RELOCATION.\n\n In the event that  Franchisee's  lease is  terminated,  with or without fault of  Franchisee,  if the Site is damaged,  condemned or otherwise  rendered unusable as a Pretzel Time Unit in accordance with this Agreement, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel Time and  Franchisee,  there is a change in the character of the location of the Site sufficiently  detrimental to his business  potential to warrant its relocation,  Pretzel Time will not unreasonably  withhold permission for  relocation  of the  Unit  to  another  Site,  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's then-current  site  criteria,  subject to the rights of  existing  Pretzel  Time franchisees  under their  franchise  agreements  with Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time is under no  obligation  to approve a relocation of the Franchise.  However,  upon written approval from Pretzel Time, Franchisee may relocate the Franchise to another  location.  Such approval shall not be granted unless  Franchisee is in compliance with all terms and conditions of this  Agreement  and  Franchisee  has the  financial  resources  available to relocate the Unit and construct a new and  comparable  Unit according to Pretzel Time's then current design  standards.  Any such  relocation of the Franchise is subject to Pretzel Time's prior  approval of the new Unit  location.  Relocation shall be at  Franchisee's  sole expense and Pretzel Time shall have the right to charge  Franchisee  for  any and all  costs  incurred  by  Pretzel  Time,  and a reasonable  fee  for  its  services,  in  connection  with  any  such  approval, evaluation  and  relocation  of the  Franchise.  The Unit  shall  re-open at the replacement  Site as soon as  reasonably  practicable  but in no event more than ninety (90) days after the closing of the original location.\n\n8.

FRANCHISEE TRAINING.\n\n 10.A.    INITIAL TRAINING.\n\n Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that, while Pretzel Time's training program will provide  Franchisee  with the  fundamental  knowledge  necessary to operate a unit,  Franchisee  cannot  expect  success  unless he devotes his best personal efforts to the business and exercises good business judgment in dealing with customers,  suppliers, and employees.  Prior to the Unit's opening, Pretzel Time shall  furnish an initial  training  program on the  operation of a Pretzel Time Unit which shall take place at Pretzel Time's  headquarters  in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  or at a location  which will  provide the best  training  for the\n\n\n\n\n\nFranchisee,  which may or may not be close to Pretzel Time's  headquarters.  The Franchisee agrees that he and his Unit Manager shall attend the initial training session held four (4) to eight (8) weeks prior to the Unit's  projected  opening date. Pretzel Time will not charge for the initial training of the Franchisee or if a corporation or partnership,  the Principal Owners of the Franchisee and the Unit  Manager.  All  incidental  expenses  relative  to the  required  training, including  travel  expenses,  hotel/motel  expenses,  and  meals  shall  be  the responsibility  of  the  Franchisee  while  attending  training.  Prior  to  the commencement  of the  operation  of the Unit,  the  manager  of the Unit  (\"Unit Manager\") and the  Franchisee or if a corporation or  partnership,  one Owner of the Franchisee as identified in Exhibit B, who will be personally overseeing the Unit shall attend and  successfully  complete the Pretzel Time initial  training program to the satisfaction of Pretzel Time.\n\n The  Franchisee  and his  Unit  Manager  must  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel  Time's  training as  determined  by Pretzel  Time, in its sole opinion, before  Franchisee is allowed to operate the Franchise.  If Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion, determines that Franchisee is unable to satisfactorily complete the  training  program,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right to  terminate  this Agreement and no franchise fees shall be refunded.  The initial training program shall cover material aspects of the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit,  including financial   controls,   employee  relations,   food  preparation,   service  and operational techniques,  sampling, recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and public  relations,  cleanliness and maintenance  procedures,  and maintenance of Pretzel  Time  System  standards.  Franchisee  shall  receive  one  copy  of the Operations Manual, which cannot be reproduced, in whole or in part. In the event that  the  Franchisee's  copy  is  lost  destroyed  or  significantly   damaged, Franchisee  shall be  obligated  to obtain from Pretzel  Time,  at  Franchisee's expense a replacement copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n 10.B.    EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\n Pretzel  Time may  provide  to  Franchisee,  at  Franchisee's  request, guidance in the selection of a Unit Manager and may provide periodic evaluations of  Franchisee's  Unit,  Managers  and  employees,  but  without  any  liability therefore to Pretzel Time.

Franchisee agrees  to  maintain  a staff  of  trained  employees  to  operate  the  Unit in compliance with Pretzel Time's standards.\n\n In the event the Unit Manager ceases to hold such full-time position at the  Unit,  Franchisee  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days in  which to  appoint  a substitute  or  replacement  Unit  Manager,  who must  attend  and  successfully complete,  to  Pretzel  Time's  satisfaction  the  initial  training  program as specified  above within sixty (60) days after  employment  as Unit  Manager.  If Pretzel  Time in its sole  discretion  determines  that the Unit  Manager or any subsequently  appointed Unit Manager has failed to  satisfactorily  complete the initial  training  program or any  additional  or  refresher  training  program, Franchisee  agrees to  immediately  hire a substitute  Unit Manager and promptly arrange  for such  person  to  complete  the  initial  training  program  to the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to notify Pretzel Time of any new  Unit  Managers  for the  Unit  within  seven  (7)  business  days of  their employment.  In the event  Franchisee  operates more than one (1) Unit, at least one (1)  trained and  competent  Unit  Manager  referred to above shall act as a full-time manager in each Territory. Franchisee shall keep Pretzel Time informed at all times of the identity of any Unit Manager(s) of the Unit.\n\n All Unit  Managers  of the Unit must  have  successfully  completed  an initial training program as specified by Pretzel Time at the sole expense of the Franchisee, including, but not limited to, salary and incidental travel expenses attendant to any training provided by Pretzel Time. Franchisee and Unit Managers who  successfully  complete  training will receive a Training  Certificate  from Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall make training  available to Franchisee's  Unit Manager during Pretzel Time's regularly  scheduled training course. In no event, will  Pretzel Time be under any  obligation  to provide  individual  training to Franchisee's  Unit  Managers.  Franchisee  agrees that each Unit  Manager  shall participate at Franchisee's  expense in Pretzel Time's initial  training program and all other mandatory  training  programs which may subsequently be offered by Pretzel Time.\n\n 10.C.  ON-SITE TRAINING.\n\n Additionally,   Pretzel   Time  will   provide   on-site   training  at Franchisee's  business  location for a period of five (5) days,  generally to be commenced  immediately  prior to  Franchisee's  day of opening and continued the first three (3) days of operation.  Franchisee  herein agrees to notify  Pretzel Time,  in writing,  of his opening  date  twenty (20) days prior  thereto.  This training  will include all  functions  required for the proper  operation of the franchise.\n\n Should Franchisee  request  additional  assistance from Pretzel Time in order to facilitate  the opening of the  Franchise,  and should Pretzel Time, in its discretion,  deem it necessary,  feasible and appropriate to comply with the request or should Pretzel Time determine that  additional  training is required, Franchisee  shall  reimburse  Pretzel Time at Pretzel  Time's then current daily training  service fee, for the expense of Pretzel Time providing such additional assistance and for its training  related  expenses,  which may include,  travel, room and board.\n\n 10.D.    COMPANY GROWTH.\n\n Throughout  the  term of  this  Agreement,  Pretzel  Time  may  provide Franchisee  with  information  on company  growth and  operations as well as new\n\n\n\n\n\ntechniques developed to reduce costs and/or enhance sales or profits.\n\n 10.E.    RETRAINING PROGRAMS.\n\n Pretzel  Time shall  provide  re-training  programs  at a  location  of Pretzel Time's choice from time to time for  experienced  franchisees  and their managers and/or employees.  Pretzel Time may charge fees for refresher  training courses  for  previously  trained  and  experienced  managers.  Fees for special programs will be based upon Pretzel Time's actual costs and attendance  shall be required. Attendance at retraining programs or seminars shall be at Franchisee's sole expense,  provided,  however,  that attendance will not be required at more than two (2) such  programs  in any  calendar  year and shall  not  collectively exceed ten (10) business days in duration during any calendar year.\n\n 10.F.    OTHER GUIDANCE.\n\n Pretzel  Time may  advise  Franchisee  from  time to time of  operating problems of the Unit which come to Pretzel Time's attention and, at Franchisee's request but without any liability  therefore to Pretzel Time, Pretzel Time shall furnish to Franchisee guidance in connection with:     (i)  Methods,  standards,   specifications  and  operating  procedures        utilized by Pretzel Time Units;\n\n  (ii) Purchasing  required  fixtures,  furnishings,  equipment,  signs,        Products, materials and supplies;\n\n  (iii) Advertising and Promotional programs;\n\n  (iv) Employee training; and\n\n  (v)  Administrative, bookkeeping, accounting and general operating and        management procedures.\n\nSuch guidance shall, in Pretzel Time's  discretion,  be furnished in the form of Pretzel  Time's  Operations  Manual,  bulletins  and  other  written  materials, electronic computer messages,  telephone  conversations  and/or consultations at Pretzel Time's offices or at the Unit. Pretzel Time will make no separate charge to  Franchisee  for  such  operating  assistance  as  Pretzel  Time  customarily provides.  From time to time, Pretzel Time may make special assistance  programs available to  Franchisee,  however,  Franchisee  will be required to pay the per diem fees and charges that Pretzel Time  establishes  from time to time for such special assistance programs.\n\n11.      ADVERTISING AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.\n\n 11.A.    PROVIDING OF ADVERTISING MATERIALS.\n\n Franchisee  and Pretzel Time agree and  recognize  the value of uniform advertising to the goodwill and public image of Pretzel Time Units. Pretzel Time has  instituted  and  maintains and  administers  an  advertising  fund for such advertising  or  public  relations   programs  as  Pretzel  Time,  in  its  sole discretion,  may deem  necessary  or  appropriate  to  advertise  or promote the Pretzel Time System,  nationally or regionally.  Pretzel Time will  periodically provide Franchisee with programs,  promotional  concepts,  and other information designed to enhance the operation of the  Franchise.  In addition,  Pretzel Time may  provide  optional  special  promotions  from time to time  which will be at Franchisee's cost, which may be mandatory. At its initial opening, Pretzel Time, at  Franchisee's  expense,  shall  designate  and supply an initial  quantity of forms,  literature,   display,  and  promotional  materials.  Pretzel  Time,  in consideration of the Advertising Fund Fee, shall periodically provide Franchisee with  camera  ready  advertising  materials.   Multiple  copies  of  advertising materials will be furnished to Franchisee for an additional  fee,  including any related shipping, handling and storage charges.\n\n 11.B.    CONTROL OF ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND CONCEPTS.\n\n Pretzel Time shall direct all such programs,  with sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials,  endorsements, and media used therein, and the placement  and  allocation  thereof.   The  manner,   media  and  cost  of  such advertising,  public  relations  and  promotional  mailings  shall be solely and completely  within the  discretion of Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion,  the target and market areas for the development  and  implementation  of such  programs.  Pretzel  Time may  expend, disburse and use funds from the Advertising  Fund, in its sole  discretion,  for the following purposes:\n\n  (1) The  creation  and  development  of nonlocal  advertising,  promotional campaigns,  and public relations to promote and enhance the  value of the Service  Marks and the  business  of all the Pretzel  Time  retail establishments;\n\n  (2) Payments to Pretzel Time of such reasonable sums as may be  necessary  for actual  costs of  advertising  production,  direct  mail  purchases, and other media marketing tools;\n\n  (3) Payment of salaries and  benefits  for staff  personnel in  the  marketing  and  public  relations  department  as  well  as  other  administrative  costs and overhead expenses of the department  incurred  by Pretzel Time;\n\n  (4) The  costs of  employing  advertising,  marketing,  public  relations and promotion  agencies to assist in preparing and conducting  media programs and activities and supporting public  relations,  market\n\n\n\n\n\n research and other advertising, promotion and marketing activities;\n\n  (5) Market  research  expenditures  related to the development  and evaluation of the effectiveness of advertising and sales promotion;  and\n\n  (6)  Costs  of  organizing   and  providing   facilities   for  international, national, or regional franchisee conferences.\n\n Franchisee  understands and  acknowledges  that the Advertising Fund is intended to maximize  recognition  of the Marks and  patronage  of Pretzel  Time Units.  Although  Pretzel Time will endeavor to utilize the Advertising  Fund to develop   advertising  and  marketing   materials  and  programs  and  to  place advertising that will benefit all Pretzel Time Units, Pretzel Time undertakes no obligation to ensure that  expenditures by the Advertising  Fund in or affecting any geographic area are  proportionate or equivalent to the contributions to the Advertising Fund by Pretzel Time Units operating in that geographic area or that any  Pretzel  Time  Units  will  benefit   directly  or  in  proportion  to  its contribution  to the  Advertising  Fund from the  development of advertising and marketing materials or the placement of Advertising.\n\n 11.C.    SEGREGATION OF ADVERTISING FUND.\n\n Pretzel  Time  herein   agrees  to   administratively   segregate   the Advertising  Fund on its books and  records.  Fees paid by  Franchisee  into the advertising  fund  shall  not  under any  circumstance  be used for the  general operating  expenses of Pretzel Time but shall and will be used  exclusively  for advertising  as outlined  herein.  Pretzel  Time may spend in any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the aggregate  contributions  of the  franchisees to the fund in that  year and  Pretzel  Time  may  make  loans to the fund  bearing reasonable  interest  to cover  any  deficits  of the fund and cause the fund to invest any surplus for future use by the fund. It is anticipated,  and it is the intent of Pretzel Time that all  contributions to the Fund shall be expended for advertising  and  promotional  purposes during Pretzel Time's fiscal year within which  contributions  are made.  Any monies not  expended  in the fiscal year in which they were  contributed  shall be applied and used for Fund expenses in the following year.\n\n   11.D. SUSPENSION OF ADVERTISING FUND FEES.\n\n Pretzel  Time  reserves  the right to  suspend  contributions/fees  and operations of the  Advertising  Fund for one or more  periods,  and the right to terminate the  Advertising  Fund, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Franchisee.  All unspent monies on the date of termination  shall be distributed to Pretzel Time's  franchisees and Pretzel Time, its Affiliates and designees in proportion to their  respective  contributions  to the Advertising Fund upon the same terms and  conditions set forth herein upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice Franchisee.\n\n 11.E.    FRANCHISEE'S REQUIRED ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES.\n\n In addition to any contributions by Franchisee to the Advertising Fund, Franchisee is required to spend on marketing and related programs such amount as is  required  pursuant  to the terms and  conditions  of  Franchisee's  lease or sublease.  Franchisee  acknowledges  such amounts will vary from lease to lease, and therefore, all Pretzel Time Unit franchisees will not be obligated to expend the same amount on local advertising and marketing of the Unit.\n\n 11.F.    USE OF TRADEMARK REFERENCES AND APPROVAL   OF FRANCHISEE'S MARKETING.\n\n Franchisee further agrees that all advertising, promotion and marketing by Franchisee shall be completely clear and factual and not misleading and shall conform to the highest  standards of ethical  marketing and  promotion  policies which may be prescribed from time to time by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee agrees to use the  registration  symbol of \"R\" within a circle (7 ) in connection with its use of the Marks.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain  from any business or marketing practice  which may be  injurious  to the  business of Pretzel Time and the good will associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.  Prior to their use by  Franchisee,  all  press  releases,  literature,  and  samples  of all  local advertising, marketing, point-of-purchase, and related materials not prepared or previously  approved  by Pretzel  Time shall be  submitted  to Pretzel  Time for approval,  which shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  If written disapproval is not received within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by Pretzel Time of such  materials,  Pretzel Time shall be deemed to have  approved the  materials. Franchisee  agrees not to use  promotional or advertising  materials  which have been  disapproved  by Pretzel Time or that have not been approved for use within the preceding twelve months.\n\n In  addition,  any  pamphlets,  brochures,  cards or other  promotional materials  offering  free Products may only be used if prepared by Pretzel Time, unless  otherwise  approved  in  advance by Pretzel  Time.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Pretzel Time will give favorable consideration to Franchisee's use of free product cards developed by Franchisee, if the cards clearly state that they may only be  redeemed  at Pretzel  Time Units  owned by  Franchisee.  Franchisee agrees to list and advertise the Franchise in the regular white pages  telephone directories distributed within Franchisee's metropolitan area.\n\n Franchisee  agrees to distribute and display at Franchisee's  location, literature,  display and promotional  materials  including  special  promotional materials  as  Pretzel  Time may from  time to time make  available.  Franchisee agrees that only those advertising,  promotional  materials,  or items which are authorized  by  Pretzel  Time in  writing  prior to use  shall be used,  sold or\n\n\n\n\n\ndistributed,  and no  alternate  display or use of the Pretzel Time Service Mark shall be made without the prior written permission of Pretzel Time.  Replacement or updated literature, display,  point-of-purchase and promotional materials may be obtained from Pretzel Time for a fee including shipping.\n\n12.

CONFIDENTIALITY OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.\n\n Pretzel Time will make  available to Franchisee  during the term of the Franchise (1) copy of the Operations  Manual by loaning a copy of the Operations Manual to Franchisee.

The Operations Manual contains trade secrets and confidential information and will  remain the  property  of Pretzel  Time and shall be  returned to it on termination of this Agreement.  Franchisee  covenants not to reveal the contents of the Operations  Manual to  unauthorized  persons.  Franchisee may not, at any time,  copy the Operations  Manual,  in whole or in part,  either  physically or electronically. In the event Franchisee's copy of the Operations Manual is lost, destroyed or significantly damaged, Franchisee shall be obligated to obtain from Pretzel Time, at Pretzel Time's then applicable  charge,  a replacement  copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n 12.C.    INCORPORATION OF OPERATIONS MANUAL INTO AGREEMENT.\n\n The  Operations  Manual's  specifications,   standards,  and  operating procedures  communicated to Franchisee in writing shall be deemed a part of this Agreement and are  incorporated  herein by  reference.  Such  Operations  Manual provisions and all reasonable  modifications shall be binding upon Franchisee to the same extent as if set forth verbatim in this Franchise  Agreement,  and such provisions  may be  changed  from  time to time by  Pretzel  Time,  in its  sole discretion,  provided that changes are  reasonably  designed to enhance  Pretzel Time's  Products,  the Pretzel  Time  System,  or  franchise  operation  and are uniformly  applied  with  respect  to all  franchisees.  Any  administrative  or financial  Section set forth in the  Operations  Manual shall be in addition to, and not in derogation or limitation  of, any right or remedy  granted to Pretzel Time  under  the  Franchise  Agreement,  the  Operations  Manual,  or any  other document,  or  otherwise  available  to  Pretzel  Time,  at  law  or in  equity, including,  without limitation,  the right to terminate a franchise in the event of certain defaults or delinquencies.\n\n 12.D.    MODIFICATIONS/UPDATES OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.\n\n  Franchisee  understands  and agrees  that the  Pretzel  Time System is constantly  being  modified  and  improved,  and  that  such  modifications  and improvements  require  changes  from time to time in the  system of  operations. Franchisee  further  agrees  to  accept  and  comply  with  such  modifications, revisions,  and additions to the Pretzel Time System and Operations Manual which Pretzel Time in the good faith exercise of its judgment believes to be desirable and reasonably necessary in the time period indicated by Pretzel Time.\n\n Franchisee  agrees  that  Standards  may be  periodically  modified  by Pretzel  Time and that such  modifications  may  obligate  Franchisee  to invest additional capital in the Unit and/or incur higher operating costs. Pretzel Time will not obligate  Franchisee to invest  additional  capital at a time when such investment cannot in Pretzel Time's reasonable  judgment be amortized during the remaining term of this  Agreement.  Franchisee  hereby agrees that standards and specifications  prescribed  from  time  to  time in the  Operations  Manual,  or otherwise  communicated  to  Franchisee  in  writing  or  electronically,  shall constitute provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.\n\n13.      UNIT IMAGE AND OPERATION.\n\n 13.A.    CONDITION AND APPEARANCE OF UNIT.\n\n Franchisee agrees that:\n\n  (1) neither the Unit nor the Site will be used for any purpose  other than the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit in full compliance with  this Agreement or other agreements with Pretzel Time; and\n\n  (2)  Franchisee  will maintain the condition and appearance of  the Unit, its equipment, furnishings, fixtures, and signs in accordance  with the  specifications  and standards of Pretzel Time and  consistent  with  the  image  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit  as a  first-class,  clean,  sanitary,  attractive and efficiently  operated food service  business;  and\n\n  (3)  Franchisee  will  perform  such  maintenance  (including,  without limitation,  maintenance  procedures and routines which Pretzel  Time  prescribes  from  time  to  time)  with  respect  to  the  decor,\n\n\n\n\n\n equipment, fixtures,  furnishings,  vehicles, and signs of the Unit and  the Site,  as may be required or directed by Pretzel  Time from time to  time to maintain such condition,  appearance,  and efficient operation,  including, without limitation:\n\n  (a)  continuous  and thorough  cleaning and sanitation of the interior        and exterior of the Unit;\n\n  (b)  thorough repainting and redecorating of the interior and exterior        of the Unit and/or the Site at reasonable intervals;\n\n  (c)  interior and exterior repair of the Unit and/or Site; and\n\n  (d)  repair or replacement of damaged, worn out or obsolete   furnishings,  equipment,  fixtures  and signs,  provided  that   Pretzel  Time  will not  require  Franchisee  to  replace  any   obsolete equipment unless Pretzel Time has initiated a program   to  replace  such  equipment  as it becomes  necessary  in its   company-owned Pretzel Time Units; and\n\n  (4) Franchisee  will not make any material  alterations to the  Site or to the appearance of the Unit as originally developed,  without  prior approval in writing by Pretzel Time; and\n\n  (5) Upon notice from Pretzel  Time,  Franchisee  shall remodel  and conform  Franchisee's  building design, Trade Dress, color schemes,  and  presentation  of Marks to Pretzel Time's then current public image  within a  reasonable  amount of time,  which  shall not  exceed six (6)  months.  Such a remodeling may include extensive  structural changes to  the Unit  fixtures and  improvements  as well as such other  changes as  Pretzel Time may direct and Franchisee  shall  undertake such a program  promptly upon notice from Pretzel Time;  provided the remodeling  shall  not be  required  until  such time as  Pretzel  Time has  commenced  or  completed a similar  program in at least fifty  percent  (50%) of those  Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Pretzel Time. This requirement  shall not apply in the  event  notice  from  Pretzel  Time is  received  during the last year of the term hereof or the term of any agreement by  virtue of which Franchisee occupies the Unit.\n\n In addition to Pretzel Time's rights to terminate this Agreement as set forth herein,  if Franchisee  does not maintain the condition and  appearance of the Unit as herein  required,  Pretzel  Time,  may,  upon not less than ten (10) days'  written  notice  (or, in cases of health or  sanitation  hazards or other public endangerment, immediately on oral or written notice) to Franchisee:\n\n  (i)  arrange  for  the  necessary  cleaning  or  sanitation,   repair,        remodeling, upgrading, painting or decorating; or\n\n  (ii) replace the necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, signs.\n\n If Franchisee  fails or refuses to initiate  within ten (10) days after receipt  of  a  notice  that  the  general  state  of  repair,  appearance,  and cleanliness of your store does not meet Pretzel Time's standards, and thereafter continue in good faith and with due  diligence a bona fide  program to undertake and complete required  maintenance or refurbishing,  Pretzel Time has the right, but is not  obligated,  to enter upon the  premises  of the Unit and effect such maintenance and  refurbishing on Franchisee's  behalf,  and Franchisee shall pay the entire cost thereof to Pretzel Time on demand.\n\n 13.B.  UNIT MENU.\n\n Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall offer for sale all  Products and no other  products,  which Pretzel Time, in its sole  discretion,  may authorize and/or require from time to time for the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall not offer for sale or sell any  Products  or  services at or from the Unit which have not been  approved in writing by Pretzel Time or use the Site or Unit for any purpose  other than the  operation  of a Pretzel  Time Unit.  Franchisee agrees that the Unit shall not sell any  Products at, from or away from the Site until Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion,  has approved the same, provided the foregoing  shall not limit  Franchisee  to sample in front of the lease  line as limited in  Franchisee's  lease.  Pretzel Time  reserves the right to change the types of  authorized  Products and require  Franchisee to offer to sell and sell the  new,  modified  or  substituted  Products.  Pretzel  Time may  develop  new Products,  methods  of  operations,  and  standards  and may  provide  you  with information about developments.  Franchisee also acknowledges and agrees that if Pretzel Time requires the Unit to use new or  substitute  products not currently offered at Pretzel  Time  Units,  Franchisee  agrees to offer such  Products  in compliance  with  Pretzel  Time's   specifications,   standards  and  procedures prescribed in the  Operations  Manuals or otherwise in writing and to diligently pursue  obtaining  any  permits  and  take  such  actions  (including,   without limitation,  constructing  improvements  and  acquiring  fixtures,  furnishings, equipment,  supplies, and materials) required to offer such Products. Franchisee acknowledges  and  understands  that such  modifications  to the  Products to be offered  by the Unit  may  require  Franchisee  to incur  additional  costs  and expenses to operate the Unit, including, without limitation, the purchase and/or lease of additional or substitute furnishings,  furniture, fixtures or equipment and Franchisee agrees to incur such expenses in connection therewith.\n\n 13.C.    ADHERENCE TO APPROVED ITEMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n The  reputation  and goodwill of all Pretzel Time Units are based upon, and can only be maintained by, the sale of  distinctive,  high-quality  Products and the  presentation,  packaging  and service of Products in an  efficient  and appealing  manner.  Pretzel  Time has  developed  and shall  continue to develop certain  proprietary food products which will be prepared by or for Pretzel Time according to Pretzel Time's recipes and formulas. Pretzel Time has developed and shall continue to develop  standards and  specifications  for fresh  hand-rolled pretzels, frozen pretzels,  pretzel toppings,  beverages and other healthy snack food  products,   materials  and  supplies   incorporated  in  or  used  in  the preparation, baking, or serving of Products authorized by Pretzel Time. The need for quality and quantity control in the Products offered for sale at the Unit is acknowledged  by  Franchisee.  All  Products  offered by  Franchisee  must be of uniform  quality and quantity  and offered for sale to the public in  accordance with Pretzel Time's  specifications  as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual and as may be amended from time to time.\n\n Pretzel  Time has  approved  and shall  review and  continue to approve suppliers and  distributors  of the  foregoing  Products,  supplies,  materials, equipment,  fixtures  and  machines  that  meet  Pretzel  Time's  standards  and requirements  including,  without  limitation,  quality,  quantity and portions, prices,  output requirements,  distribution methods and locations,  standards of service, financial capability,  customer service and other criteria.  Franchisee agrees that minimum standards for items of inventory,  Products,  machines,  and equipment  may  be  recognized  by  brand  name  rather  than  by  technical  or engineering description.\n\n Franchisee  agrees  that  it  will  use  all  equipment  and  Products, including, without limitation, food products,  smallwares,  equipment, and paper products as designated by Pretzel Time and shall purchase Pretzel Time's private label  food  products,   materials,  supplies  and  proprietary  food  products, ingredients,  spices, sauces, mixes,  beverages,  materials and supplies used in the  preparation of Products  developed by or for Pretzel Time or its Affiliates whether or not pursuant to a special recipe or formula or bearing the Marks only from Pretzel  Time,  its  Affiliates  or  non-affiliated  sources  designated by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  further agrees to purchase only from distributors and suppliers  approved  or  required by Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee  agrees that the approved Products, equipment, smallwares, and inventory used on the premises may alter from time to time as Pretzel Time reasonably deems  necessary.  Franchisee agrees to offer for sale only those  Products  approved  by Pretzel  Time and no others without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall not, after receipt in writing of any modification of an approved or required supplier or distributor,  manufacturer  of equipment,  products,  materials,  supplies or other items  reorder any product  from any  supplier or  distributor  that is no longer  approved.  Pretzel Time may approve or require a single  distributor  or supplier  for any  Products,  materials or supplies and may approve or require a distributor or supplier only as to certain products, materials and supplies, and such approval may be temporary pending a further  evaluation of such distributor or supplier by Pretzel Time. Pretzel Time may concentrate  purchases with one or more distributors or suppliers to obtain lower prices and/or advertising support and/or  services for the benefit of Pretzel Time, the Pretzel Time System and/or Pretzel Time Units.\n\n Pretzel Time will loan to Franchisee a list of approved  brand Products for use during the term of this  Franchise  Agreement  at the  initial  training session.  Franchisee  agrees to not copy the list.  Franchisee will,  during the term of this Agreement and after its  termination  or  expiration,  maintain the list  and its  contents  in  strict  confidence,  and  upon  the  expiration  or termination of this Franchise Agreement,  whichever is earlier, will immediately return it to Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall promptly provide  Franchisee with any  amendments to the  designated  list of inventory of available  Products and supplies to be carried and sold at Franchisee's  location.  Franchisee  shall at all times  maintain an adequate  inventory of approved  Products  sufficient  in quality and variety to realize the full potential of the Unit.\n\n 13.D.    EXCEPTION PROCESS.\n\n If   Franchisee   proposes  to  purchase   materials  or  supplies  not theretofore  approved by Pretzel Time as meeting its  specifications,  or from a supplier or  distributor  not  previously  approved by Pretzel Time,  Franchisee shall first notify Pretzel Time and request  Pretzel  Time's  approval using the special exception form provided to Franchisee in its Operations  Manual, and pay any reasonable fees that Pretzel Time designates therefor.  Further,  Franchisee agrees to use all forms  specified and developed by Pretzel Time for  requesting any exceptions in products or suppliers.  Pretzel Time may require submission of sufficient information and samples to determine whether such materials, supplies or suppliers meet its specifications as well as financial  information regarding the  supplier.  Pretzel Time will advise  Franchisee  within a  reasonable  time whether such\n\nmaterials or supplies meet its specifications.  Pretzel Time does not maintain a formal criteria for approving materials,  supplies or suppliers.  All approvals, disapprovals  and  revocations of approval of suppliers will be  communicated to Franchisee,  in writing,  and shall be in the sole  discretion  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  must  comply  with  the  following  conditions  in  order  to seek a substitution for a Pretzel Time approved Product:\n\n  (1) Franchisee  shall submit a written request to Pretzel Time\n\n\n\n\n\n  for approval of a non-approved supplier or product;\n\n  (2)  Franchisee  and  supplier  shall  demonstrate  to Pretzel   Time's  reasonable  satisfaction that it is able to supply the   commodity  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's   specifications   to   Franchisee; and\n\n  (3)  The  supplier   shall   demonstrate   to  Pretzel  Time's   reasonable  satisfaction that the supplier is of good standing   in the  business  community  with  respect  to  its  financial   soundness and the  reliability  of its product and service and   shall  request  in  writing  to  Pretzel  Time to be  named an   approved supplier.\n\n 13.E.  PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES.\n\n Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion,  collect  and  retain all  allowances,  benefits,  credits,  monies, payments  or  rebates   (collectively   \"Promotional   Rebates\"),   whether  for promotional,  advertising  or other  purposes,  offered to Franchisee or Pretzel Time or its Affiliates by manufacturers,  suppliers and distributors  based upon Franchisee's  purchases of Products or other products and materials.  Franchisee assigns to Pretzel  Time or its designee all of  Franchisee's  right,  title and interest  in and to any and  all  such  Promotional  Allowances  and  authorizes Pretzel  Time or its  designee to collect any such  Promotional  Allowances  for remission to the general operating funds of Pretzel Time.\n\n14.

A Unit  shall be under  the  direct,  on-premises  supervision  of a  trained  and competent  Franchisee  or a  trained  and  competent  employee  acting as a Unit Manager  at  all  times.  Franchisee  shall  remain  active  in  overseeing  the operations of the Unit  conducted  under the  supervision  of such Unit Manager. Pretzel  Time shall have the right to deal with the Unit  Manager and  assistant managers on matters  pertaining to the  day-to-day  operations of, and reporting requirements  for the Unit.  Franchisee shall be required to notify Pretzel Time within seven (7) business days of changing Unit Managers.  Franchisee shall hire all employees of the Unit and shall be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their  employment and compensation and for the proper training of such employees in the operation of the Unit.\n\n If the Unit at any time is not being  managed by you or a Unit  Manager who shall have satisfactorily completed Pretzel Time's training program, Pretzel Time is  authorized,  but is not  required to  immediately  appoint a Manager to maintain  the  operations  of the Unit for you.  Pretzel  Time has the  right to change a reasonable fee for such management  services,  not to exceed our costs, and to cease to provide such  management  services at any time.  Pretzel  Time's right to manage a Unit and obtain  reimbursement  for costs also  applies in the event of your death or disability.\n\n 14.B.  SUFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL.\n\n Franchisee shall maintain an adequate sales force to serve properly all customers,  and shall  carry at all times a stock of  merchandise  of such size, character,  quality and price to produce the maximum return to Franchisee and so as to produce all of the gross  revenue  which may be produced by such manner of operation.\n\n 14.C.

If the gross sales report is not submitted as herein  specified,  Pretzel Time may, at its option,  charge a late fee of $50.00 to Franchisee.  There will only be one late fee for each late report.\n\n 14.D.    EMPLOYEE DRESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\n The  presentation  of an uniform  image is  essential  to a  successful franchise  system.  Franchisee  shall cause all  employees of  Franchisee  while working  at the  franchise  location  to dress  appropriately  (in the  specific uniform  approved and  designated  by Pretzel  Time) in keeping with the Pretzel Time image,  as Pretzel Time may designate  from time to time, to present a neat and clean  appearance  and to render  confident  and  courteous  service  to the Franchise's customers.\n\n 14.E.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES.\n\n Franchisee  shall secure and maintain in force in his name all required licenses,  permits,  and  certificates  relating to the conduct of his  business pursuant to this  Agreement.  Franchisee  will  conduct the  Franchise in strict compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  ordinances,   regulations,  and  other requirements  of any federal,  state,  county,  municipal  or other  government, including,   without  limitation,  those  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to preparation,  purchase  and  handling of food  products,  occupational  hazards,\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth,  safety and sanitation,  worker's compensation  insurance,  unemployment insurance,  and  withholding  and payment of all taxes.  While  Pretzel Time may advise  Franchisee  as  a  courtesy  on  any  applicable  laws,  ordinances,  or regulations,  Pretzel Time  undertakes  no duty to do so and  Franchisee  hereby acknowledges  it is Franchisee's  sole duty to inquire  regarding and concerning all laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations  affecting  the Unit,  its  operations, employees and Franchisee.\n\n Franchisee shall in all dealings with its customers, suppliers, Pretzel Time, and public officials adhere to high standards of honesty,  integrity, fair dealing and ethical conduct.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain from any business or advertising  practice which may be injurious to the business of Pretzel Time and the goodwill associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.\n\n Franchisee  shall notify  Pretzel  Time within three (3) business  days after the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award or court decree which may adversely affect the operation or financial  condition of Franchisee or the unit or immediately  notify Pretzel Time of any notice of health or sanitation violation.\n\n 14.F.

SALE OF PRODUCT.\n\n Franchisee agrees not to sell or offer to sell any materials, supplies, or  inventory  used in the  preparation  of any of the  Products  other  than to Pretzel  Time and that he shall  not  sell,  dispense,  give  away or  otherwise provide without Pretzel Time's prior written consent any product except by means of retail sales in the  franchise  location.  Franchisee  may only sell finished Products  and may not sell any Products to any person or entity  purchasing  the Products for resale.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Franchisee may offer free samples of  Products  at or  directly  in front of the Unit to retail  customers only.\n\n 14.H.    COOPERATION.\n\n Franchisee  agrees that he shall  cooperate with Pretzel Time in taking any action, or refraining from any action, which in the judgment of Pretzel Time is  necessary or desirable to promote and enhance the quality of the products of the Franchise location, the service provided by the Franchisee,  or the image of the Franchise in the community.\n\n 14.I.    INSURANCE.\n\n Franchisee shall maintain at Franchisee's expense, in form, amounts and with insurers  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time,  which  insurers must have an A.M. Best  Company  rating of \"A-\" or better and naming  Pretzel  Time an  additional insured,  insurance  against all types of public  liability with personal injury coverage and property damage coverage. In addition to coverage as aforesaid such insurance  shall  include  coverages as set forth in the  Operations  Manual and shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.\n\n The insurance afforded by the policy or policies  respecting  liability shall  not be  limited  in any  way by  reason  of any  insurance  which  may be maintained  by  Pretzel  Time.  Within  sixty  (60) days of the  signing of this Agreement,  but in no event later than the date on which Franchisee  acquires an interest in the real  property  (by lease or  purchase) on which it will develop and operate the Franchise,  a Certificate of Insurance  showing  compliance with the foregoing  requirements shall be furnished by Franchisee to Pretzel Time for approval.  Such certificate shall state that said policy or policies will not be canceled or altered  without at least thirty (30) days prior  written  notice to Pretzel Time and shall reflect proof of payment of premiums. Maintenance of such insurance  and the  performance  by  Franchisee  of the  obligations  under this Section shall not relieve Franchisee of liability under the indemnity  provision set forth in this  Agreement.  Minimum  limits as required above may be modified from time to time, as conditions require by written notice to Franchisee.\n\n Should  Franchisee not procure and maintain such insurance  coverage as required  by Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right and  authority, without any obligation to do so, immediately procure such insurance coverage and to charge same to Franchisee,  which charges  together with a reasonable fee for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in connection with such procurement,  shall be payable by Franchisee immediately upon notice.\n\n Franchisee  shall fully  cooperate  with Pretzel Time in its efforts to obtain  such  insurance  policies,  promptly  execute  all forms or  instruments required to obtain or maintain such insurance policies, allow inspections of the Unit or vehicles  which are  required to obtain and maintain  insurance  and pay Pretzel Time on demand for any costs or premiums.\n\n 14.J.    SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES.\n\n Pretzel  Time  may  from  time to time  advise  or  offer  guidance  to Franchisee  relative to prices for Products  offered for sale by Franchisee that in Pretzel Time's judgment  constitute good business practice.  Franchisee shall not be  obligated  to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right  to  determine  and to sell  products  at any  price  that it  determines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever Pretzel Time recommends a retail price, such  recommendations are based on Pretzel  Time's  experience  concerning  all factors that enter into a proper price, but such recommendation is in no manner binding on Franchisee and no such advice or guidance  shall be deemed or construed to impose upon  Franchisee  any obligation  to charge any  fixed,  minimum  or  maximum  prices for any  product offered for sale by the Franchise.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to advertise retail  prices of Pretzel Time  Products,  provided  that such retail prices are qualified as \"suggested.\" The parties understand and agree that such advertising shall not be  construed  as  requiring  Franchisee  to adhere to such prices but Franchisee shall have complete freedom to establish retail prices.\n\n15.      ACCOUNTING, REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n\n 15.A.  ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.\n\n Franchisee  shall  establish at his own expense a complete and accurate bookkeeping,  accounting,  record keeping and data processing system prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles and conforming to the requirements and formats that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time.

Franchisee agrees to maintain on the premises  all sales and  operational  information  for four weeks.\n\n Any such  inspection  or audit will take place at a time which will not interfere with  Franchisee's  normal business.  Franchisee shall fully cooperate with Pretzel Time's representatives and independent accountants hired by Pretzel Time to conduct any such inspection or audit.  If Pretzel Time deems  necessary, Franchisee shall deliver to Pretzel Time or its designated  agents copies of all bookkeeping  records not already in the  possession of Pretzel  Time,  including customer  records,  cash  register  tapes,  sales and  purchase  records and tax records,  to enable Pretzel Time or its representative or designee to adequately audit Franchisee's  gross sales.  Franchisee hereby waives any right to withhold tax records relative to the Franchise as privileged information. Each report and\n\n\n\n\n\nfinancial  statement  shall be signed and verified by  Franchisee  in the manner Pretzel Time prescribes.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to require  Franchisee to have audited or reviewed financial statements prepared on an annual basis.\n\n In the event  that an audit  discloses  that  Franchisee's  actual  net revenues exceed  Franchisee's  reported net revenues by two percent (2%) or more for any thirty day  period,  Franchisee  is  obligated  to pay to Pretzel  Time, within  fifteen (15) days after receipt of the  inspection or audit report,  the royalty of seven percent (7%) and the  Advertising  Fund Fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of such  understatement  plus interest from the date such payments were originally due. The audit will be conducted at the expense of Pretzel Time, provided that if an audit  disclosed an  understatement  of two percent (2%), as described above,  Franchisee will bear the cost of the audit,  including without limitation,  the charges of attorneys  and any  independent  accountants,  their travel   expenses,   room  and  board,   and   compensation  of  Pretzel  Time's representatives  and  independent  accountants.  Providing  that in no case will Franchisee be obligated to pay more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for such inspection  or audit  costs.  The  foregoing  remedies  shall be in  addition to Pretzel Time's other remedies and rights under this Agreement or applicable law.\n\n 16.B.    RIGHT OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION.\n\n To determine  whether  Franchisee  and the Unit are complying with this Agreement and with all Pretzel Time's  standards and operations as prescribed by Pretzel Time,  Pretzel Time or its designated agents shall have the right at any reasonable time and without prior notice to Franchisee to:\n\n a.

If Pretzel Time's assignee will perform any of Pretzel Time's obligations under this Agreement,  then that assignee must be financially capable of performing  those  obligations and the assignee must expressly assume and agree to perform  them.  Franchisee  agrees that Pretzel Time shall have the right,  from time to time, to delegate the  performance of any portion or all of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.\n\n 17.B.

Accordingly, Franchisee agrees no Transfer shall be made without Pretzel Time's prior written approval.  Any Transfer  without such approval shall constitute a breach of this Agreement  and shall be void and of no  effect.  Pretzel  Time's  consent to the assignment  shall  neither  constitute  a  novation  or change  in  Franchisee's obligations under this agreement,  nor constitute a waiver of any claims Pretzel Time may have  against  Franchisee  (or its  Owners)  nor be  deemed a waiver of Pretzel Time's right to demand the transferee's exact compliance with all of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n 17.C.

Franchisee shall   furnish  Pretzel  Time at the  time of the  execution  of this   Agreement or of assignment to the  corporation  or partners of   Franchisee, a written agreement stating that no stockholder or   partner  will  sell,  assign  or  transfer  voluntarily  or by   operation  of law  any  securities  of  Franchisee,  or  other   ownership  interest  in  Franchisee,  to any  person or entity   other than existing shareholders or partnership, to the extent   permitted  hereunder,  without  the prior  written  consent of   Pretzel Time.

The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership of shares  of a class of  securities  listed on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the number of shares of that class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding.  If Pretzel  Time exercises its right of first refusal, Franchisee (and its Owners) further agrees that he will abide by the restrictions of Section 17.C.(13).\n\n  If  Pretzel  Time  does not  exercise  its  right  of  first  refusal, Franchisee or its Owners may complete the sale to such purchaser pursuant to and on the exact  terms of such  offer,  subject to Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Transfer as provided in Section 17,  provided that if the sale to such purchaser is not completed  within 120 days after  delivery of such offer to Pretzel Time, or if there is a  material  change  in the terms of the sale  (which  Franchisee shall  promptly  communicate  to Pretzel  Time),  Pretzel  Time's right to first refusal shall be extended for thirty (30) days after the  expiration of such 120 day period or after the material change in the terms of the sale so communicated to Pretzel Time.\n\n 17.H.    PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS.\n\n In the event  Franchisee (or any of its Owners)  shall,  subject to the restrictions  and  conditions  of Transfer  contained in Section 17,  attempt to raise or secure funds by the sale of securities (including,  without limitation, common or preferred stock,  bonds,  debentures or general or limited partnership interests) in Franchisee or any affiliate of Franchisee, Franchisee, recognizing that the written information may reflect upon Pretzel Time, agrees to submit any such written information used with respect thereto prior to its inclusion in any registration  statement,  prospectus or similar offering  circular or memorandum and to obtain Pretzel Time's written consent to the method of financing prior to any offering or sale of such securities. Pretzel Time's written consent pursuant to this Section  shall not imply or  constitute  Pretzel  Time's  approval  with respect to the sale of the  securities,  the  offering  literature  submitted to Pretzel  Time or any other aspect of the  offering.  No  information  respecting Pretzel  Time  shall  be  included  in  any  disclosure   document  unless  such information  has  been  furnished  by  Pretzel  Time  in  writing   pursuant  to Franchisee's  written request,  in which Franchisee states the specific purposes for  which the  information  is to be used.

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n\n\n\n\n 18.A.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the default is other  than a failure to pay a monetary  obligation  to Pretzel  Time or to a related  company and of a nature that more than thirty (30) days are  reasonably required to cure,  Franchisee  shall  commence  to cure the default  within said thirty (30) day period and shall proceed with such cure with due diligence  with a view to accomplishing the cure at the earliest possible moment, and within the period,  if any,  designated  by Pretzel Time as the allowable  additional  time within which the cure must be accomplished.\n\n 19.C.

Additionally Franchisee agrees not to seek an injunction order   from any court in any  jurisdiction  relating  to  insolvency,   reorganization of arrangement proceedings which would have the   effect of staying or enjoining this provision.

Failure  to   relocate to other Pretzel  Time-approved  premises  within the   time specified in this Agreement  after loss of possession due   to eminent  domain,  destruction of premises or termination of   lease without  Franchisee's  fault shall  constitute an act of   Default with no right to cure and immediate  termination  upon   notice; or\n\n  (viii) The existence of an imminent danger to public health or   safety or fails or refuses to comply with  standards  relating   to the  cleanliness  or sanitation of the Unit or violates any   health, safety or sanitation,  law ordinance or regulation and   does not correct such  noncompliance  within  forty-eight (48)   hours after written notice thereof is delivered to Franchisee;   or\n\n  (ix) The loss of the right to occupy the  premises  from which   the  franchise  is  operated by either  Franchisee  or Pretzel   Time; or\n\n    (x) Material  falsification  of business records and reports     required by Pretzel Time; or\n\n  (xi)  Franchisee  (or any of its Owners) makes an  assignment,   surrenders  or  transfers  control of the Unit's  operation in   violation of this Agreement; or\n\n  (xii)  Franchisee (or any of its Owners) has made any material   misrepresentation  or  omission  in the  application  for  the   Franchise or in materials submitted relating to a transfer; or\n\n  (xiii)  Franchisee,  (or  its  Owners)  or  members  of  their   immediate  family violate the restrictions on the operation of   Competitive Businesses during the term of this Agreement; or\n\n  (xiv)  Franchisee (or any of its Owners or employees) makes an   unauthorized  use or disclosure  of or duplicates  any copy of\n\n\n\n\n\n  any Confidential  Information or uses, duplicates or discloses   any  portion of the  Operations  Manual in  violation  of this   Agreement; or\n\n  (xv) Failure on two (2) or more separate  occasions within any   period  of  twelve  (12)  consecutive  months  or on three (3)   occasions during the term of this Agreement to submit when due   reports or other data, information or supporting records or to   pay when due the  Royalty  and fees or other  payments  due to   Pretzel Time or its  Affiliates  or otherwise  fails to comply   with this  Agreement,  whether or not such  failures to comply   with this Agreement,  Advertising Fund Fee are corrected after   notice thereof is delivered to Franchisee; or\n\n  (xvi) Fails to cure a default under this Agreement  within the   time specified or provide proof  acceptable to Pretzel Time of   efforts  which  are  reasonably  calculated  to  correct  such   failure within a reasonable  time,  which shall in no event be   more than sixty (60) days after such  notice,  if such failure   cannot  reasonably be corrected  within twenty (20) days after   written  notice of such  notice of  default  is  delivered  to   Franchisee; or\n\n  (xvii) Franchisee terminates this Agreement without cause; or\n\n  (xviii) Franchisee  understates the Unit's net revenues in any   report or financial  statement  by an amount  greater than two   (2) percent; or\n\n  (xix)  Franchisee  causes or permits to exist a default  under   the  lease or  sublease  for the Site and  fails to cure  such   default  within the  applicable  cure  period set forth in the   lease or sublease; or\n\n  (xx)  Franchisee  (or any of its Owners) fails on three (3) or   more separate  occasions within any period of twenty-four (24)   consecutive  months to comply with this  Agreement  whether or   not such  failures  to comply are  corrected  after  notice of   default  is  given,  or  failure  on two (2) or more  separate   occasions within any period of twelve (12) consecutive  months   to comply within the same  requirement  under this  Agreement,   whether or not such  failures  to comply are  corrected  after   notice of default is given.\n\n20.

DISCONTINUANCE OF MARKS.\n\n Franchisee  agrees to immediately  discontinue  all use of trade names, trademarks,  logotypes,  forms of advertising  and other  commercial  symbols of Pretzel Time, and forms of advertising indicative of Pretzel Time and cancel all assumed  name  registrations.  Franchisee  further  shall  remove or cause to be removed all signs and  structures  indicative  of a Pretzel  Time Unit and shall alter the premises occupied by Franchisee so as to distinguish the same from its former appearance and from a Pretzel Time franchise.  Further,  Franchisee shall discontinue  the use of any and all printed goods and materials using said trade names,  trademarks,  logos and other  commercial  symbols  of Pretzel  Time.  If Franchisee  refuses to comply  with the terms of this  Section 20 after  Pretzel Time  requests  compliance,  Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right to enter  upon Franchisee's  premises  without being deemed guilty of  trespassing or any other offense,  and make or cause to be made such  changes  at  Franchisee's  expense, which Franchisee agrees to pay upon demand.\n\n Franchisee  agrees to not directly or  indirectly at any time or in any manner (except with respect to other Pretzel Time Units owned by the Franchisee) identify himself or any business as a current or former Pretzel Time Unit, or as a franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee further  agrees to not use any Mark,  any colorable  imitation  thereof or other indicia of a Pretzel  Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize for any purpose any trade name,  trade or service  mark or other  commercial  symbol that suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee (or any of its Owners) agrees after  termination he will not do  business  under any name or in any  manner  that  might tend to give the general  public the  impression  that he is  associated,  affiliated,  licensed, franchised by or related to Pretzel Time.  The Franchisee (or any of its Owners) may not thereafter  use any name,  logo type, or symbol  confusingly  similar to\n\n\n\n\n\nPretzel  Time's  Service  Mark,  logo type or symbol.  If  Franchisee  continues operating a business at the franchised  location it will exert every  reasonable effort to inform the public of his new status,  including a change of  telephone number and advertising materials.\n\n The Franchise granted to Franchisee  hereunder to sell Products bearing Pretzel Time's Marks does not include the right to sell or advertise for sale of Franchisee's  Franchise itself or of its business location.  No advertisement by Franchisee  or  other  public  solicitation  for  sale of his  interest  in this Agreement  may  include a  representation  of Pretzel  Time's  trademark  or any reference to Pretzel Time or its trademark system.\n\n 20.C.    RETURN OF MATERIALS.\n\n Franchisee  agrees to return to  Pretzel  Time all  signs,  sign-faces, forms,  invoices,  letterhead,  and  other  materials  containing  any  Mark  or otherwise identifying or relating to a Pretzel Time Unit and allow Pretzel Time, without liability to remove all such items from the Unit. Franchisee also agrees to return all  materials  and  confidential  information  loaned to  Franchisee, including,  without limitation,  all Operations Manuals and Training Manuals and videos. Franchisee agrees to return all materials and supplies identified by the Marks in full cases or  packages  to Pretzel  Time for credit and dispose of all other materials and supplies, but not equipment,  identified by the Marks within thirty (30) days after the effective  date of  termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n 20.D.    TELEPHONE COMPANY.\n\n Franchisee  agrees to notify the  telephone  company and all  telephone directory  publishers of the termination or expiration of Franchisee's  right to use any  telephone  and telecopy  numbers and any regular,  classified  or other telephone  directory  listings  associated  with any Mark and to  authorize  the transfer  thereof to Pretzel Time or at its direction.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees  that as between  him and  Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time has the sole rights to and  interest in all  telephone  and  telecopy  numbers and  directory listings  associated  with any Mark.  Franchisee  authorizes  Pretzel Time,  and hereby appoints Pretzel Time and any of its officers as Franchisee's attorney in fact, to direct the telephone company and all telephone directory  publishers to transfer any telephone and telecopy numbers and directory  listings  relating to the Pretzel Time Units to Pretzel Time or at its  direction,  should  Franchisee fail or refuse to do so, and the telephone  company and all telephone  directory publishers  may accept such direction or this agreement as conclusive of Pretzel Time's  exclusive  rights in such  telephone and telecopy  numbers and directory listings  and Pretzel  Time's  authority to direct  their  transfer.  Franchisee agrees to execute a  collateral  assignment  of  telephone  numbers and listings agreement  which is attached hereto as Exhibit G. In no event shall Pretzel Time be responsible  for any charges  incurred by Franchisee and associated  with the telephone company prior to the date of transfer.\n\n 20.E.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n Franchisee (and its Owners) agrees that upon  termination or expiration of this Agreement, he will immediately cease to use any Confidential Information of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates disclosed to him pursuant to this Agreement in any business or otherwise.  This  provision is also  applicable to the Owners if the Franchise is a corporation or partnership.\n\n 20.F.    LEASING.\n\n If Franchisee  has leased the  premises,  Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion  and without any  obligation to do so,  assume the lease.  Franchisee will not be entitled to any refund of the initial franchise fee,  royalties,  or Advertising Fund Fees.\n\n 20.G.    COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.\n\n Upon  termination of this  Agreement,  in accordance with its terms and conditions or by Franchisee  without cause, or upon expiration of this Agreement (unless the Franchise is renewed as provided for in this Agreement),  Franchisee and its Owners agree that for a period of TWELVE (12) months  commencing  on the effective  date of  termination  or expiration  or the date on which  Franchisee complies  with this Section,  whichever is later,  neither  Franchisee,  nor its Owners,  nor any person or entity  affiliated  with  Franchisee or  Franchisee's shareholders or partners shall have any direct or indirect  interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners or otherwise) as a disclosed or beneficial owner, investor,  partner, director,  officer, employee, consultant,  representative,  agent or in any other capacity in any  Competitive Business  located or operating:  (1) at the Site;  (2) within three (3) miles of the Unit;  and/or (3) within  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit in operation  or  under  development  on  the  effective  date  of  termination  or expiration of this  agreement for a period of one year after the  termination or expiration.  The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership  of shares of a class of  securities  listed  on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the  number  of shares  of that  class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding. Franchisee  and its Owners  expressly  acknowledge  that they possess skills and abilities of a general nature and have other  opportunities  for exploiting such skills. Consequently, enforcement of the covenants made in this Section will not deprive the Franchisee or its Owners or shareholders of their personal  goodwill or ability to earn a living.\n\nThe Franchise  Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyond\n\n\n\n\n\nthe termination of the franchise. Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge that the covenant  not to compete is fair and  reasonable,  and will not impose any undue hardship,  since the Franchisee (and its Owners) has other considerable  skills, experience and education  which will afford him the opportunity to derive income from other endeavors.\n\nNeither  Franchisee  nor any of its Owners shall divert or attempt to divert any business or any customers of any Pretzel Time Unit to any  Competitive  Business or employ or seek to employ any  person who is  employed  by Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or a franchisee  of Pretzel Time nor induce or attempt to induce any such person to leave said  employment  without the prior written consent of such person's employer.\n\n 20.H.  PRETZEL TIME'S RIGHT TO PURCHASE ASSETS OF THE UNIT.\n\n Upon  termination of this Agreement by Pretzel Time in accordance  with its terms and  conditions or by Franchisee  without cause or upon  expiration of this  Agreement  (unless the franchise  has been  renewed),  Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or  its  assignee  shall  have  the  option  (not  the  obligation), exercisable  by giving  written  notice  thereof within sixty (60) days from the date of such  expiration  or  termination,  to acquire from  Franchisee  all the assets  in the Unit  including  the  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  leasehold improvements,  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials,  supplies  and other tangible assets of the Unit and an assignment of the lease for the Unit. Pretzel Time  shall  have the  unrestricted  right to assign  this  option to  purchase. Pretzel Time or its assignee  shall be entitled to all customary  warranties and representations  in  connection  with its  asset  purchase,  including,  without limitation,  representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition of and title to assets, no liens and encumbrances on the assets,  validity of contracts and agreements and liabilities  inuring to Pretzel Time or affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n (1) The purchase price for the assets of the Unit shall be equal to the greater of:\n\n  The sum of the book  value  of the  Unit's  assets  (including   furnishings,  fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements)   amortized on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year period   plus the lesser of costs and the then-current wholesale market   value of all  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials  and   supplies (i.e. in good and saleable condition and not obsolete   or discontinued), or\n\n  The  product of the Unit's  average  cash flow for the two (2)   most recently  completed  fiscal years  multiplied by two (2).   \"Cash  flow\"  represents  the  Unit's  net  revenues  less all   pretzel  unit-related  costs (i.e., cost of goods sold, labor,   occupancy   and  other  Unit   expenses)  as  well  as  annual   administrative  costs of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and   royalty and  service  fees,  but not  including  interest  and   depreciation.\n\n (2)  Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  shall have the right to set off against and reduce the purchase  price by any and all amounts owed by Franchisee to Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates.  Pretzel  Time may exclude from the assets purchased  hereunder any  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  usable  inventory of Products,  materials  or supplies of the Unit that Pretzel Time has not approved as meeting its standards for Pretzel Time Unit,  and the purchase price shall be reduced by the  replacement  costs of such excluded  items which are required in the operation of the Unit.\n\n (3) The  purchase  price  shall be paid in cash at the  closing  of the purchase, which shall take place no later than ninety (90) days after receipt by Franchisee  of Pretzel  Time's notice of exercise of this option to purchase the Unit, at which time Franchisee shall deliver instruments transferring to Pretzel Time or its assignee good and merchantable  title to the assets purchased,  free and clear of all liens and encumbrances  with all sales and other transfer taxes paid by  Franchisee,  and all  licenses  or  permits  of the Unit  which  may be assigned or transferred. In the event the closing of the purchase does not occur within said ninety (90) day period because Franchisee fails to act diligently in connection therewith,  the purchase price shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Franchisee  further agrees that the purchase  price shall be further  reduced by ten percent (10%) per month for each subsequent  month  Franchisee  fails to act diligently to consummate this  transaction.  In the event that Franchisee cannot deliver clear title to all of the purchased assets as aforesaid, or in the event there are other unresolved  issues, at Pretzel Time's option,  the losing of the sale shall be accomplished through an escrow.  Prior to closing,  Franchisee and Pretzel  Time shall  comply with the  applicable  Bulk Sales  provisions  of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the state in which the Unit is located.\n\n (4) If Pretzel Time or its assignee  exercises this option to purchase, pending  the  closing of such  purchase,  Pretzel  Time may appoint a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit, at its option,  require  Franchisee to close the Unit during such time period  without  removing any assets.  If Pretzel Time appoints a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit pending closing of such purchase, all funds from the Unit's operation during the period of management by a  Pretzel  Time  appointed  manager  shall be kept in a  separate  fund and all expenses of the Unit, including compensation,  other costs and travel and living expenses of the Pretzel Time appointed  manager,  shall be charged to such fund. As compensation for the management services provided,  Pretzel Time shall charge such fund ten  percent  (10%) of the  Unit's net  revenues  during the period of Pretzel Time's management. Operation of the Unit during any such period shall be for and on behalf of  Franchisee,  provided  that Pretzel Time shall have a duty only to utilize its good faith  efforts and shall not be liable to Franchisee or\n\n\n\n\n\nits Owners for any debts,  losses or obligations  incurred by the Unit or to any creditor  of  Franchisee  for any  merchandise  materials,  supplies  or service purchased by the Unit during any period in which it is managed by Pretzel Time's appointed  manager.  Franchisee  shall maintain in force all insurance  policies required for the Unit until the date of closing.\n\n21.      RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n 21.A.    EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.\n\n Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time would be unable to protect  Confidential  Information  against  unauthorized  use or disclosure and would be unable to  encourage  a free  exchange of ideas and  information  among Pretzel Time Units if  Franchisees  of Pretzel Time Units were permitted to hold interests in or perform services for a Competitive  Business except as specified in Exhibit C.  Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  therefore agrees that  during the term of the  Franchise  Agreement,  or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement,  whichever is shorter,  neither Franchisee  nor  any  Affiliate,  immediate  family  member,  or  in  the  event Franchisee is a corporation\n\nany Owner thereof and member of his immediate  family or in the event  Franchise is a partnership any partner  (general or limited) thereof and any member of his immediate family, shall:\n\n (1) Have  any  direct  or  indirect  interest  as an  owner,  investor,  partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, agent  or in  any  other  capacity  in any  Competitive  Business  located  or  operating  at the Site or within  three (3) miles of any  Pretzel  Time  Unit  in  operation  or  under  development  on the  effective  date of  termination or expiration of this Agreement, except a Pretzel Time Unit  operated by Franchisee under Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time; or\n\n (2) Recruit or hire any employee who, within the immediately  preceding  six (6) month period,  was employed by Pretzel Time or any Pretzel Time  Unit operated by Pretzel Time, its Affiliates or another  franchisee or  licensee  of  Pretzel  Time,   without   obtaining  the  prior  written  permission of Pretzel Time or such franchisee.\n\n Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Franchisee shall not be prohibited from owning securities  listed on a stock exchange or traded on the  over-the-counter market that represents two percent (2%) or less of that class of securities.\n\n Covenants contained in this Section shall be construed as severable and independent,   and  shall  be  interpreted  and  applied   consistent  with  the requirements  of  reasonableness.  Any judicial  reformation of these  covenants consistent  with this  interpretation  shall be enforceable as though  contained herein  and shall not affect any other  provisions  or terms of this  Agreement. This non-compete provision may not be enforceable under the laws of your state.\n\n 21.B.  NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.\n\n Franchisee shall not employ any of the Marks in signing any contract or applying  for any  franchise or permit or in a manner that may result in Pretzel Time's  liability for any of Franchisee's  indebtedness or obligations,  nor may Franchisee  use the Marks in any way not  expressly  authorized by Pretzel Time. Except as expressly  authorized in writing,  neither Pretzel Time nor Franchisee shall  make  any  express  or  implied  agreements,  warranties,  guarantees  or representations  or  incur  any  debt in the  name or on  behalf  of the  other, represent that their relationship is other than Pretzel Time and franchisee,  or be obligated by or have any liability  under any  agreements or  representations made by the other that are not  expressly  authorized  in writing.  Pretzel Time shall not be  obligated  for any damages to any person or  property  directly or indirectly  arising out of the  operation of the Unit or  Franchisee's  business authorized by or conducted pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n 21.C.    TAXES.\n\n Pretzel  Time shall have no  liability  for any  sales,  use,  service, occupation,  excise,  gross receipts,  income,  property or other taxes, whether levied upon Franchisee, the Unit, Franchisee's property or upon Pretzel Time, in connection with the sales made or business  conducted by Franchisee.  Payment of all such taxes shall be Franchisee's responsibility.\n\n 21.D.    INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n Franchisee   agrees  to  indemnify   and  hold  Pretzel  Time  and  its subsidiaries,  Affiliates, stockholders,  directors, officers, employees, agents and assignees harmless against, and to reimburse them for, any loss,  liability, judgment  or damages  (actual or  consequential)  and all  reasonable  costs and expenses of  defending  any claim  brought  against any of them or any action in which any of them is named as a party (including, without limitation, reasonable accountants,  attorneys' and expert witness fees, costs of investigation,  court costs, other litigation expenses,  damages to Pretzel Time's reputation and good will, travel expenses) which any of them may suffer,  sustain or incur by reason of, arising from or in connection  with  Franchisee's  ownership or operation of the Unit, unless such loss, liability or damage is only due to the negligence of Pretzel  Time  (or  its  Affiliates,  subsidiaries).  Pretzel  Time's  right  to indemnity  under  this  agreement  shall  arise  notwithstanding  that  joint or concurrent  liability  may be  imposed on Pretzel  Time by  statute,  ordinance, regulation or other law.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that any action or inaction by any third party which is not an  Affiliate of Pretzel Time shall not\n\n\n\n\n\nbe attributable to or constitute negligence of Pretzel Time. The indemnities and assumptions of liabilities and  obligations  herein shall continue in full force and effect  subsequent to and  notwithstanding  the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee of any claims and Franchisee shall be given the  opportunity  to assume the  defense of the matter.  If  Franchisee fails to assume the defense  within  three (3) days of notice  thereof,  Pretzel Time may defend the action in the manner reasonably appropriate,  and Franchisee shall pay to Pretzel Time all reasonable  costs,  including  without  limitation attorney's  fees,  court  costs,  expert  witness  fees,  travel  and  telephone expenses, incurred by Pretzel Time in effecting such defense, in addition to any such sum which Pretzel Time may pay by reason of any settlement agreed to by the parties or reasonably  negotiated by Pretzel Time in the event  Franchisee fails to assume the defense, or judgment against Pretzel Time.\n\n 21.E.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.\n\n It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that Franchisee is an independent contractor and is not an agent, partner, joint venturer, or employee of  Pretzel  Time.  Pretzel  Time and  Franchisee  agree  that  nothing  in this Agreement  is  intended  to  create  a  fiduciary   relationship  between  them. Franchisee  shall have no right to bind or obligate  Pretzel Time in any way nor shall he  represent  that he has any right to do so.  Pretzel Time shall have no control over the terms and conditions of employment of Franchisee's employees.\n\n In all public records and in his  relationship  with other persons,  on stationery, business forms and checks, Franchisee shall indicate his independent ownership of the  franchised  Unit and that he is a franchisee  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  shall exhibit on the premises in such places as may be designated by Pretzel  Time,  a Pretzel  Time  approved  notice  that the  franchised  Unit is operated by an  independent  operator and not by Pretzel Time or Pretzel  Time's Affiliates,  which operate company owned  franchises.  Franchisee shall take all legal  steps  such as a  fictitious  name  registration  to ensure  Franchisee's independent business status.\n\n22.      PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS.\n\n 22.A.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n Pretzel Time  possesses  and will further  develop and acquire  certain confidential  and  proprietary  information  and trade  secrets  relating to the operation  of  Pretzel  Time  Units,  which  includes,  but not  limited  to the following  categories  of  information,  methods,  techniques,  procedures,  and knowledge  developed or to be  developed by Pretzel  Time,  its  consultants  or contractors,  its Affiliates or its designees, and/or franchisees (\"Confidential Information\"):\n\n (1)  methods,   techniques,   equipment,   specifications,   standards,  policies, procedures, information, concepts and systems relating to and  knowledge  of  and  experience  in  the   development,   operation  and  franchising of Pretzel Time Units:\n\n (2) site selection criteria;\n\n (3) marketing and promotional programs for Pretzel Time Units;\n\n (4) recipes, ingredients,  formulas, mixes, spices, seasonings, sauces,  recipes for, and methods for the preparation,  cooking,  and serving of  the Products;\n\n (5)  techniques,  formats,  specifications,  systems,  procedures,  and  knowledge of and experience in the development and operation of Pretzel  Time Units;\n\n (6) knowledge of specifications  for and suppliers of certain Products,  materials, supplies, equipment, furnishings and fixtures;\n\n (7) sales data and information  concerning  inventory  requirements for  Products,  materials and supplies, and specifications for and knowledge  of suppliers of certain materials,  equipment, and fixtures for Pretzel  Time Units;\n\n (8) employee selection procedures, training and staffing levels;\n\n (9) Operations Manual and other Manuals prepared by Pretzel Time; and\n\n (10) information concerning Product sales, operating results, financial  performance and other financial data of Pretzel Time Units.\n\n Pretzel Time will disclose such parts of the  Confidential  Information as  Pretzel  Time deems  necessary  or  advisable  from time to time in its sole discretion  for the  operation  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit to  Franchisee  during training, and in guidance and assistance furnished to Franchisee during the term of the Franchise, and Franchisee may learn or otherwise obtain from Pretzel Time additional  Confidential  Information  of  Pretzel  Time  during the term of the Franchise.  Franchisee acknowledges that the foregoing Confidential  Information is highly  confidential.  Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees  that he will not acquire  any  interest  in  Confidential  Information,  other  than the right to utilize Confidential Information disclosed to Franchisee in the operation of the Pretzel  Time  Unit  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  and  that the use or duplication  of  any  Confidential  Information  in  any  other  business  would constitute an unfair method of competition. Franchisee, including its directors,\n\n\n\n\n\nofficers,  shareholders,  and partners agree(s) that Confidential Information is proprietary,  includes  trade  secrets  of  Pretzel  Time  and is  disclosed  to Franchisee solely on the condition that Franchisee  agrees,  and Franchisee (and its Owners) does hereby agree, that he:\n\n (1) shall not disclose any  information  pertaining to the Pretzel Time  System,  directly or indirectly,  to any person,  natural or corporate,  without the express prior written  consent of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  may disclose to its Unit Manager such  information  deemed necessary to  disclose,  provided  such Unit  Manager  has  agreed to  maintain  such  information in confidence in Pretzel Time's  confidentiality  agreement  and Pretzel Time has received such executed agreement  (attached hereto  as Exhibit H);\n\n (2) Will not use  Confidential  Information  in any other  business  or capacity;\n\n (3)  Will  maintain  the  absolute   confidentiality   of  Confidential  Information during and after the term of this Agreement;\n\n (4) Will not make  unauthorized  copies of any portion of  Confidential  Information disclosed in written or other tangible form; and\n\n (5) Will adopt and implement  all  reasonable  procedures  that Pretzel  Time  prescribes  from  time  to time to  prevent  unauthorized  use or  disclosure of Confidential Information,  including, without limitation,  restrictions on disclosure thereof to his employees.\n\n This  confidentiality  requirement  shall  not apply in a  judicial  or administrative  proceeding  to the extent  Franchisee  is legally  compelled  to disclose such information,  provided Franchisee shall have used his best efforts and shall have afforded  Pretzel Time the  opportunity  to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance satisfactory to Pretzel Time of confidential treatment for the information required to be so disclosed.  This restrictions on Franchisee's  disclosure and use of the Confidential  Information shall also not apply to the  disclosure of  information,  methods,  procedures,  techniques and knowledge which are or become  generally  known in the food service  business in the Territory, other than through disclosure (whether deliberate or inadvertent) by Franchisee.\n\n Notwithstanding   the  foregoing  and  any  other   provision  of  this Agreement,  Franchisee may use the  Confidential  Information in connection with the operation of other Pretzel Time Units (in addition to the Unit)  pursuant to other Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time.\n\n 22.B.  DISCLOSURE OF IDEAS AND NEW PROCEDURES.\n\n Franchisee  shall  fully and  promptly  disclose to Pretzel  Time,  all ideas,  concepts,  methods  and  techniques  relating  to  the  development  and operation  of a dessert or snack food  business  conceived  or  developed by the Franchisee  and/or  Franchisee's  employees  during the term of this  Agreement. Franchisee  agrees and grants to Pretzel Time and its Affiliates a perpetual and worldwide  right to use and  authorize  other  Pretzel  Time Units or other food service businesses  operated by Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  franchisees and designees  to  use  such  ideas,  recipes,  formulas,   concepts,  methods,  and techniques  relating to the development  and/or  operation of a dessert or snack food business.  If incorporated into the Pretzel Time System for the development and/or operation of Pretzel Time Units, such ideas, recipes, formulas, concepts, methods and techniques  shall become the sole and exclusive  property of Pretzel Time without any further consideration to Franchisee. Pretzel Time shall have no obligation to make any lump sum or on-going  payments to Franchisee with respect to any such idea, concept, method, technique or product.  Franchisee agrees that Franchisee  will not use nor will it allow any other person or entity to use any such concept,  method,  technique or product  without  obtaining  Pretzel Time's prior written approval.\n\n23.      ENFORCEMENT.\n\n 23.A.    UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS.\n\n Delays in the  performance  of any duties  hereunder  which are not the fault of, and not within the reasonable  preventive control of, the party due to perform,  including but not limited to, fire,  flood,  labor  disputes,  natural disasters, acts of God, civil disorders, riots,  insurrections,  work stoppages, slowdowns or disputes,  or other  similar  events,  shall not cause a default in said  performance,  but the parties shall extend the time of  performance  for a period of time equivalent to the length of delay,  or for such other  reasonable period of time as agreed by the parties.\n\n 23.B.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE.\n\n The rights of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  hereunder are cumulative and no exercise or  enforcement by Pretzel Time or Franchisee of any right or remedy hereunder  shall  preclude  the  exercise  or  enforcement  by  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee  of any  other  right  or  remedy  herein  or which  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee is entitled by law to enforce.\n\n 23.C.    WAIVER OF OBLIGATIONS.\n\n Pretzel Time may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation  of  or  restriction  upon  Franchisee  under  this  Agreement,   and Franchisee may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation of or  restriction  upon  Pretzel  Time under  this  Agreement,  effective  upon delivery of written  notice  thereof to the other or such other  effective  date stated on the notice of waiver.  Whenever this Agreement requires Pretzel Time's\n\n\n\n\n\nprior  approval  or  consent,  Franchisee  shall make a timely  written  request therefore, and such approval shall be obtained in writing. Pretzel Time makes no warranties  or  guaranties  upon  which  Franchisee  may rely,  and  assumes  no liability or  obligation  to  Franchisee,  by granting  any waiver,  approval or consent to  Franchisee,  or by reason of any  neglect,  delay,  or denial of any request therefore. Any waiver granted by Pretzel Time shall be without prejudice to any other rights Pretzel Time may have, will be subject\n\nto continuing review by Pretzel Time, and may be revoked, in Pretzel Time's sole discretion,  at any  time  and  for  any  reason,  effective  upon  delivery  to Franchisee of ten (10) days' prior written notice.\n\n 23.D.    CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS.\n\n  All  obligations of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  which expressly or by their very nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement  shall continue  in  full  force  and  effect  subsequent  to and  notwithstanding  its expiration  or  termination  and until  they are  satisfied  or by their  nature expire.\n\n 23.E.    INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS.\n\n If any provisions of this  Agreement,  or its application to any person or  circumstance,  is deemed  invalid or  unenforceable  by a court of competent jurisdiction,  then the remainder of this  Agreement or the  application of such provision  to other  persons or  circumstances  shall not be  affected  thereby, provided,  however,  that if any provision or application  thereof is invalid or unenforceable,  the court shall  substitute a suitable and  equitable  provision therefore  in order to carry out,  so far as may be valid and  enforceable,  the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n\n If any applicable and binding law or rule of any jurisdiction  requires a  greater  prior  notice  of the  termination  of or  refusal  to enter  into a successor Franchise  Agreement to this Agreement than is required hereunder,  or the  taking of some  other  action  not  required  hereunder,  or if,  under any applicable  and binding law or rule of any  jurisdiction,  any provision of this Agreement  or any  standard or procedure  outlined in the  Operations  Manual is invalid or unenforceable,  the prior notice and/or other action required by such law or rule shall be  substituted  for the  comparable  provisions  hereof,  and Pretzel  Time shall  have the  right,  in its sole  discretion,  to modify  such invalid or unenforceable operations procedure or standard to the extent required to be valid and enforceable.\n\n 23.F.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\n\n Franchisee  recognizes and  acknowledges the unique value and secondary meaning  attached to the Pretzel Time system,  its  trademarks,  service  marks, standards of operation and Pretzel Time's property.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that any noncompliance with the restrictive  covenants  contained herein, including  without  limitation  those provisions  pertaining to  noncompetition, confidentiality  and the improper or  unauthorized  use of Pretzel  Time's Marks will cause  irreparable  damage to Pretzel Time and its franchisees.  Franchisee therefore agrees that should it violate any restrictive covenant, or threaten to breach the  restrictive  covenants,  then Pretzel Time shall be entitled to both permanent  and temporary  injunctive  relief,  without  bond,  from any court of competent  jurisdiction  in addition to any other remedies to which Pretzel Time may be entitled,  at law or in equity,  under this agreement or otherwise  under applicable law.\n\n 23.G.    APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n Except to the extent governed by the U.S. Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  \"1051 et seq.),  this Agreement,  the other agreements  referred herein,  and the offer and the sale of the  franchise  shall be  governed in all respects  and  aspects  by the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  and expressly  excluding  the laws  pertaining  to the choice of law and conflict of laws.\n\n 23.H.    ENTIRE STATUS OF AGREEMENT.\n\n This Agreement  contains the entire  agreement of the parties and there are no other oral or written  understandings or agreements  between Pretzel Time and Franchisee  relating to the subject matter of this agreement,  except as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Offering  Circular  required by Rule under the Federal Trade  Commission  Act, a copy of which has been provided to  Franchisee  and of which   Franchisee   acknowledges   receipt,   there  are  no   representations, inducements, promises, agreements arrangements or undertakings, oral or written, between  the  parties  hereto  other than those set forth and duly  executed  in writing.  No agreement of any kind shall be binding upon either party unless and until the same has been made in writing and duly executed by both parties.\n\n Upon  acceptance  of this  Agreement  by  Pretzel  Time,  all  previous agreements,  contracts,  arrangements  or  understandings  of any kind,  oral or written,  relative to the franchise granted herein are cancelled, and all claims and demands  thereon are fully  satisfied.  This  agreement,  although  drawn by Pretzel Time,  shall be construed  fairly and reasonable,  and not more strictly against one party than against the other party hereto.\n\n 23.I.    AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT.\n\n This  Agreement  shall not be  modified  or  amended  except by written\n\n\n\n\n\nagreement  executed by both parties hereto.  No oral amendment or waiver will be effective and that this provision cannot be orally amended or waived.  No waiver of default or rights will be effective unless in writing.\n\n 23.J.    HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.\n\n Subject to the provisions  hereof  relating to transfer and assignment, this Agreement is intended to and does bind the heirs, executors, administrators and successors of any or all of the parties hereto.\n\n 23.K.    CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES.\n\n The obligations of the parties hereunder are expressly  conditional and contingent  upon the full execution of and performance of all obligations by the parties  under this  Agreement.  This  Agreement is expressly  conditional  upon Franchisee  executing all documents  required by this Agreement  within ten (10) days of receipt of the document.  Failure by Franchisee to execute any documents shall result in the Agreement being null and void.\n\n In addition during Franchisee's  training,  all documents pertaining to the  franchising of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time Unit shall be held in escrow by Pretzel Time. Title in and to the Pretzel Time Unit shall not pass to Franchisee until  Franchisee  has  been  trained  as  a  Pretzel  Time  franchisee  to  the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If Franchisee  fails to  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel Time initial  training,  the appointment of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time franchisee  and the granting of the franchise  business to  Franchisee  shall be null and void, all documents executed between Franchisee and Pretzel Time or its designees with respect to the transaction shall be terminated and cancelled. The Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that no portion of the Franchise fee shall be refunded if Franchisee  fails to complete  Pretzel Time's initial training class to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If the  Franchisee  completes the initial training to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time will  provide to Franchisee fully signed copies of the Franchise Agreement.\n\n It is  understood  and agreed by the parties  that the  granting of the franchise  and all  contracts  and  agreements  entered  into by and between the parties with respect to the Unit are specifically contingent upon the signing of a lease for the Site.  In the event that a lease for the Site cannot be obtained on or before sixty (60) days after  delivery of Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Site at no fault  or delay by  Franchisee,  then all  contracts  and  agreements entered into by Pretzel Time, and  Franchisee  shall become null and void and of no effect,  and all monies  deposited by Franchisee less a nonrefundable  fee of $2,500 shall be refunded.\n\n 23.L.    WAIVER BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n No waiver by  Pretzel  Time of any  default  or  failure  to perform by Franchisee,  or of any  breach of the  terms of this  Agreement  or no  failure, refusal or neglect of Pretzel Time to exercise any right,  option or power given it under this Agreement,  shall preclude Pretzel Time from thereafter  requiring strict  compliance or from declaring  this  Agreement and the franchise  granted herein  revoke or  terminated.  The failure of Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Agreement upon the occurrence of one or more Acts of Default will not constitute a waiver  or  otherwise  affect  the right of  Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Franchise  because of a continuing or subsequent  failure to cure one or more of the aforesaid events of default or any other default.\n\n 23.M.    COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ENFORCEMENT.\n\n If a claim  for  amounts  owed by  Franchisee  to  Pretzel  Time or its Affiliates  is  asserted  in any  judicial or  arbitration  proceeding  or later appeal,  or if Pretzel Time is required to enforce the Franchise  Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding or later appeal, the prevailing party will be entitled  to  reimbursement  of its costs  and  expenses,  including  reasonable arbitrators',  accountants'  and  legal  fees,  whether  incurred  prior  to, in preparation for or in contemplation of the filing of any written demand,  claim, action,  hearing or  proceeding  to enforce  the  obligations  of the  Franchise Agreement.  If Pretzel Time incurs  expenses in connection  with your failure to pay when due amounts  owing to Pretzel  Time,  to submit  when due any  reports, information  or  supporting  records or otherwise  to comply with the  Franchise Agreement,  including,  but not limited to legal,  arbitrators'  and  accounting fees, you are required to reimburse Pretzel Time for any such costs and expenses which it incurs.  23.N.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE\n\n THE  RIGHTS  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND  PRETZEL  TIME ARE  CUMULATIVE  AND NO EXERCISE OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY PRETZEL TIME OR  FRANCHISEE  OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY HEREUNDER  SHALL  PRECLUDE  THE  EXERCISE  OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY  PRETZEL  TIME OR FRANCHISEE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY TO WHICH THE PARTY IS ENTITLED.\n\n 23.O.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.\n\n     BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND THE  FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM,  WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY.  THE PARTIES  FURTHER AGREE THAT NEITHER SHALL DEMAND A JURY TRIAL IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION.\n\n 23.P.  WAIVER OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO  FRANCHISEE'S  OBLIGATION  TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME, THE PARTIES WAIVE TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM FOR ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER AND AGREE THAT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE  BETWEEN THEM,  THE PARTY MAKING A CLAIM SHALL BE LIMITED TO RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES IT SUSTAINS.\n\n\n\n\n\n 23.Q.  EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.\n\n BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND  FRANCHISEE  AGREE THAT ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING  TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  THE OFFER AND GRANTING OF THE FRANCHISE  RIGHTS  HEREUNDER  SHALL BE INSTITUTED AND MAINTAINED ONLY IN A STATE OR FEDERAL  COURT OF  GENERAL  JURISDICTION  IN DAUPHIN  COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA  OR THE COUNTY IN WHICH PRETZEL TIME MAINTAINS ITS PRINCIPAL  PLACE OF BUSINESS.\n\n FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  SUBMITS TO THE  JURISDICTION OF SAID COURT AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION  FRANCHISEE MAY HAVE TO EITHER THE JURISDICTION OR VENUE OF SUCH COURT.\n\n 23.R.    LIMITATIONS OF CLAIMS\n\n EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS  BROUGHT BY PRETZEL TIME WITH REGARD TO  FRANCHISEE'S OBLIGATIONS  TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO PRETZEL TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT OR TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR THE  RELATIONSHIP  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND PRETZEL  TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE BARRED  UNLESS AN ACTION IS COMMENCED  WITHIN:  (1) TWO (2)  YEARS  FROM THE DATE ON WHICH  THE ACT OR EVENT GIVING  RISE TO THE  CLAIM  OCCURRED  OR (2) ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH FRANCHISEE  OR  PRETZEL  TIME KNEW OR SHOULD  HAVE  KNOWN,  IN THE  EXERCISE  OF REASONABLE  DILIGENCE OF THE FACTS GIVEN RISE TO SUCH CLAIMS,  WHICHEVER  OCCURS FIRST.\n\n24.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS.\n\n Franchisee  acknowledges  that he has read this  Agreement  and that he understands  and accepts the terms,  conditions and covenants  contained in this Agreement as being reasonably  necessary to maintain Pretzel Time's high quality and service and the uniformity of those  standards at all Pretzel Time Units and thereby to protect and preserve the goodwill of the Marks.\n\n Pretzel Time  disclaims  and  Franchisee  acknowledges  that he has not received or relied upon any representations, promises, guarantees or warranties, expressed  or  implied,  made to induce the  execution  hereof or in  connection herewith which is not expressly contained herein or in the disclosure statement. More specifically,  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that no person acting on behalf of Pretzel Time or its affiliated  companies has made any written or oral claim,  statement,  assurance,  promise or projection of any sort  regarding the actual  or  prospective  sales,  earnings,  gross  profit  or net  profit of the franchise,  which is the subject of this agreement.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time's officers, directors, employees and agents act only in a representative  and not in a personal capacity in connection with any of their dealings with  Franchisee.  Franchisee  recognizes that neither Pretzel Time nor any other person can guarantee  Franchisee's success in the franchised business. Franchisee  further  represents  to Pretzel  Time, as an inducement to its entry into this  Agreement,  that all statements in  Franchisee's  application for the Franchise   are  accurate  and  complete  and  that   Franchisee   has  made  no misrepresentations or material omissions in obtaining the franchise.\n\n25.

This Agreement, including the Exhibits attached hereto, and the Deed, constitute the entire Agreement and understanding between the parties to this Agreement and integrates and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements or arrangements between them related to its subject matter.

Upon execution of this Agreement by all parties to this Agreement, the Memorandum shall be deemed terminated and cancelled. Each party acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement, it does not rely on, has not relied on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, warranty or other provision (in any case whether oral or written, express or implied and whether negligently or innocently made) of any Person (whether a party to this Agreement or not) which is not expressly set out in this Agreement and the only remedy available in respect of any misrepresentation or untrue statement made to such party shall be a claim for breach of contract under this Agreement except to the extent that the misrepresentation or untrue statement is repeated in this Agreement in which case any remedies for misrepresentation shall be unaffected and nothing in this clause shall operate to limit or exclude any liability arising from any fraudulent or dishonest statement, act or omission.\n\n14.4 Assignment.

[*], IAC and Sonos shall meet to review any changes that have occurred in the total cost for each Product since the prior review and according to the cost model formula described in Exhibit G. [*].\n\n7.8. Purchase Price Variance (PPV). Consistent with Section 6.4 of this Agreement, Sonos and IAC shall compare the cost model formula results between the invoiced pricing for Products [*] and the actual cost data that applied to the formula for the period. [*] Additionally, IAC and Sonos may agree to settle other costs that are incurred [*] in the next PPV calculation. Based on the results of the PPV calculation, the Parties will execute a credit or debit (positive or negative) memo for the entire Purchase Price Variance amount to be applied against the next payment(s) made by Sonos. IAC agrees to provide Sonos with any requested documentation relevant to the PPV calculation, including but not limited to copies of invoices from Components suppliers.\n\n7.9. Component Procurement, Supply Management, Component Buffer Inventory, and Excess Components. Sonos desires to empower IAC to place Component purchase orders and otherwise manage the Component supply chain necessary to execute the on-time manufacture and shipment of Products. IAC shall be responsible to maintain accurate and up to date Component Lead Times and cancellation terms for all Components required to manufacture Products, and to place purchase orders for all Components according to Component Lead Times and the most recent Sonos Purchase Orders and Rolling Forecast. For Components that more than one supplier is qualified for usage in Products (\"multi-sourced Components\"), IAC shall execute Component purchase orders according to the volume share instruction given by Sonos. For such multi-sourced Components, IAC and Sonos shall agree to a process to, on [*], review and revise according to Sonos' instruction the purchase order volume share to be placed by IAC between qualified Component suppliers. In the event of a change in quantities of Products in a Sonos Purchase Order or Rolling Forecast, IAC shall respond quickly to adjust its purchase orders for all Components and to confirm revised supply plans with all Component suppliers. Within [*] of receiving a new Sonos Rolling Forecast, IAC shall review Product manufacturing capacity and Component availability and provide Sonos a written shipment commitment plan (including shipment quantities by date). This plan should meet Sonos' latest Rolling Forecast unless Product manufacturing capacity or Component availability does not support the Rolling Forecast, in which case the Parties will work together to resolve such issues. Unless Sonos otherwise instructs IAC in writing, IAC shall not reduce or cancel purchase orders on any other Components due to such Component shortage. In the event that IAC notifies Sonos that it is in possession of Excess Components, (and subject to the maximum liability parameters set forth in Exhibit C), IAC will use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce its inventory of Excess Components, including, without limitation, returning such Excess Components to the supplier, using such Components for IAC's support and repair obligations, selling the Excess Components (subject to the limitations in this section) and/or using the Excess Components for other Products or the products of other customers of IAC or an IAC Affiliate. [*]. If IAC can only sell an Excess Component at a loss, it must obtain prior written authorization from Sonos for such sale, Page 16 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\nunless the aggregate amount of the loss Sonos would incur is [*].

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sonos may disclose that IAC is manufacturing its Products to potential investors, partners and customers. The Parties specifically acknowledge that disclosure of this Agreement or the relationship contemplated hereby, without the prior written consent of the other party, would have a material, adverse impact on the other party's relationship with its existing manufacturing partner.\n\n12.3. Non-use and Non-disclosure. Each party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except as necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Each party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to any third party, except that, a receiving party may disclose the other party's Confidential Information to those employees of the receiving party who are required to have the information in order to perform under this Agreement and who have agreed in writing to confidentiality obligations at least as protective of the disclosing party as those set forth herein. If a receiving party is required by a final authorized order from a recognized and applicable government body or from a court with competent jurisdiction to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise constrained by this Agreement, the receiving party will provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief. Subject to the foregoing sentence, such receiving party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that the receiving party is legally compelled or is otherwise legally required to disclose; provided, however, that the receiving party provides such assistance as the disclosing party may reasonably request in obtaining such order or other relief. Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects that embody the other party's Confidential Information and that are provided to the party under this Agreement.\n\n12.4. Maintenance of Confidentiality. Each party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no case less than reasonable care (including, without limitation, all precautions the receiving party employs with respect to its own confidential materials). No party shall make any copies of the other party's Confidential Information except upon the other party's prior written approval. Each party shall reproduce the other party's proprietary rights notices on any such authorized copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original or otherwise that can clearly express the other party's proprietary rights. A party receiving Confidential Information shall promptly notify the party disclosing such Confidential Information of any use or disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement of which the receiving party becomes aware. Confidentiality shall be maintained for a period of [*] after expiration of this Agreement. Page 21 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\n12.5.

The Parties agree that any principle of construction or rule of law that provides that an agreement shall be construed against the drafter of the agreement in the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in such agreement shall not apply to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Titles and headings to articles and sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to affect the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

Page 34 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit F\n\nSonos Supplier Performance Review F.1 Introduction.\n\nSonos supplier management strategy is based on developing strong working relationships with its suppliers. The results Sonos seek will not occur from random sourcing or selecting suppliers solely on competitive quotations. It will result from working closely with the best existing suppliers to improve quality, productivity, cost, and all other elements of supplier performance.\n\nThe basic strategy entails establishing mutual performance expectations and metrics, providing supplier performance feedback, initiating corrective actions to ensure continuous improvements, and rewarding the best suppliers with the opportunity for future new business. The Sonos Supplier Performance Review program provides a framework for effective communication between Sonos and its suppliers regarding the specific elements of supplier performance. The result of establishing our expectations and supplier performance feedback will ensure maximum customer satisfaction and increased profitability for all contributors to the system. To accomplish these objectives, Sonos aims to: \u2022 Establish and strengthen long-term partnerships that result in mutual success between the Parties \u2022 Set expectations and metrics that are aggressive yet realistic and achievable \u2022 Utilize a team approach to achieve performance improvements \u2022 Be open to 2-way feedback and commit ourselves to continuous improvement, just as we expect from our supply and manufacturing partners\n\nSuccessful supplier performance in the areas of Quality, Business, Engineering, Supply Chain & Operational Excellence is expected and necessary for both parties to achieve repeat business, increased sales and profitable growth. F.2 Supplier Performance Review Metrics.\n\nIAC must maintain a competitive advantage by providing products of the highest quality and a competitive total cost, with operations that demonstrate best in class manufacturing, quality, engineering and supply chain innovation and execution. The Parties will mutually agree in good faith upon valid performance metrics, goals, and a relevant scoring template and process.\n\nThe Parties agree to meet [*] to review IAC's performance and scoring for the period. It is targeted to alternate meeting locations between Sonos' USA HQ office and IAC's factory. Dates and locations for such reviews will be agreed between the Parties with reasonable notice.

Sonos reserves the right to audit and measure any manufacturing or test process or cycle time, as well as review any relevant IAC documentation to verify that Product pricing is calculated accurately. Consistent with Section 6.4 of this Agreement, Sonos and IAC will review all inputs to the above Pricing Formula for each Product on a quarterly basis, and adjust Product pricing as necessary to become effective in the next quarter.

DESCRIPTION OF DESIGNATED AREA C.     LEASE ADDENDUM\n\n          i\n\n    bw-3 FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n        FRANCHISE AGREEMENT\n\n       This Franchise Agreement (\"Agreement\") made this _____ day of ________, 19____, by and between bw-3 FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, INC. an Ohio corporation which has its principal place of business at 1919 Interchange Tower, 600 South Highway 169, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55426 (\"we\" or \"us\"), and __________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ _______________ (\"you\").  If you are a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, certain provisions of the Agreement also apply to your owners and will be noted.\n\n    BACKGROUND:\n\n       A.   Our parent company has developed a unique system (\"System\") for establishing and operating restaurants which use the service mark \"BUFFALO WILD WINGS\" and which feature chicken wings, sandwiches, and other products and beverages, which are all prepared according to specified recipes and procedures (\"Menu Items\"), some of which use proprietary mixes (\"Trade Secret Food Products\"), and has granted to us the right to sublicense the System to others.\n\n       B.   The distinguishing characteristics of the System include, without limitation, distinctive exterior and interior layout, design and color scheme, signage, decorations, furnishings and materials, special recipes, formulae, menus and food and beverage designations, Confidential Manuals, food and beverage storage, preparation service and delivery procedures and techniques, operating procedures for sanitation and maintenance, and methods and techniques for inventory and cost controls, record keeping and reporting, purchasing, sales promotion and advertising, Trade Secret Food Products, all of which may be\n\n\n\n\n\nchanged, improved and further developed from time to time.\n\n       C.   Our parent company is the owner of the trade names, service marks and trademarks \"BUFFALO WILD WINGS\", \"bw-3\" and other logos and commercial symbols, and such other trade names, service marks, and trademarks as are now designated (and may later be designated by us in writing) as part of the System (\"Marks\").\n\n       D.   We grant franchises to qualified candidates for the operation of \"Buffalo Wild Wings\" Restaurants offering the Menu Items and utilizing the System and Marks.  You desire to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings Restaurant using the System and Marks and have applied for a franchise, which application has been approved by us in reliance upon all of the representations you have made.\n\n       E.   You understand and acknowledge the importance of our high and uniform standards of quality and service and the necessity of operating the Buffalo Wild Wings business in conformity with our standards and specifications.\n\n    AGREEMENTS:\n\n       We and you agree as follows:\n\nI.     APPOINTMENT AND FRANCHISE FEE\n\n       A.   Subject to the provisions stated below, we hereby grant you a license to use the \"Buffalo Wild Wings\" Marks and System, and you undertake the obligation to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant facility featuring the Menu Items and providing sit-down, carry-out and other restaurant services (\"Franchised\n\n          1\n\nRestaurant\"), and to use the Marks solely in connection with the System, as it is currently established, and as it may be changed, improved and further developed from time to time, at one (1) location only, such location to be: 1) ____________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________, or 2)  at a location to be designated, as provided in Paragraph III within the area described on EXHIBIT B.  When a location has been designated and approved by you and us, it will become part of Paragraph I.A.1., as if originally incorporated in that Paragraph.  You shall not relocate your Franchised Restaurant without our prior written approval.\n\n       B.   You receive a Designated Area within which we and our affiliates shall not operate or grant to anyone else a franchise to operate a Buffalo Wild Wings or bw-3 Restaurant so long as this Agreement is in force and effect.  The Designated Area is described in writing and on a map attached to the Agreement as EXHIBIT B and is made a part of the Agreement.  You do not have any right to sublicense or subfranchise others within or outside of the Designated Area and do not have the right to operate more than one (1) Franchised Restaurant within the Designated Area.\n\n       C.   You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to grant other franchises outside of the Designated Area as we deem appropriate.  Although we will not operate a Buffalo Wild Wings or bw-3 business within the Designated Area, we reserve the right, both within and outside of the Designated Area, to offer and sell at special events (at our option, if you elect not to participate in such events) or at wholesale, through channels of distribution distinct from those of a Franchised Restaurant, products and services which comprise, or may in the future comprise a part of the System, which products may be resold at retail to the general public by such entities. Further, you acknowledge that certain locations within the Designated Area are by their nature unique and separate in character from sites generally developed as Franchised Restaurants.  As a result, you agree that the following locations (\"Special Sites\") are excluded from the Designated Area and we shall have the right to develop (by direct ownership or franchising) such locations: 1) public transportation facilities, including airports, train stations and bus stations; 2) military bases; 3) sports facilities, including race tracks; and 4) amusement and/or theme parks.\n\n       D.   We and our affiliated companies shall not engage in catering and delivery services and activities in the Designated Area.  You shall not engage in catering and delivery services and activities outside of the Designated Area. We shall have no obligation to enforce similar covenants against any other System franchisee.  Other System franchisees shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of such.  You shall not offer for sale any Menu Items or Proprietary Products by means of Internet/World Wide Web programming or advertising.  We reserve the right to market and sell Menu Items and Trade Secret Food Products on the Internet/World Wide Web.\n\n       E.   You pay us a nonrefundable Initial Franchise Fee of ________________ _______________________ Dollars ($________) which is payable in full on the date of this Agreement.  The Initial Franchise Fee has been fully earned upon receipt and is nonrefundable in consideration of the expenses incurred by us in granting this franchise and for the lost or deferred opportunity to franchise others.\n\n       F.   You acknowledge that because complete and detailed uniformity under many varying conditions may not be possible or practical, we specifically reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to vary standards for any System franchisee based upon the peculiarities of the particular site or circumstance, density of population, business potential, population of trade area, existing business practices or any other condition which we deem to be of importance to the successful operation of such franchisee's business.  You shall not be entitled to require us to grant to you a like or similar variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n       G.   In consideration of our agreement not to grant another franchise in the area described in Paragraph I.C., you at all times shall use your best efforts to promote and increase the sales and service of Menu\n\n          2\n\nItems and to effect the widest and best possible distribution throughout the Designated Area, soliciting and servicing all potential customers and accounts for Buffalo Wild Wings food products and services.\n\nII.    TERM AND RENEWAL\n\n       A.   The term of this Agreement is for ten (10) years commencing on the date of this Agreement, unless terminated as provided by this Agreement.\n\n       B.   You have the right to renew the franchise for two (2) successive terms equal to five (5) years each, providing you meet all of the following conditions:\n\n    1.    You have, during the entire term, complied with all the provisions of the Agreement;\n\n    2.    The premises of the Franchised Restaurant meet our then-current standards for Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants and you are able to maintain possession of the Franchised Restaurant.  Before the expiration date of this Agreement you must bring the Franchised Restaurant into full compliance with the specifications and standards then applicable for new or renewing Buffalo Wild Wings businesses and present us with evidence satisfactory that you have the right to remain in possession of the Franchised Restaurant premises for the duration of the renewal term.  In the event you are unable to maintain possession of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant or if the premises do not meet our then-current standards, you may secure substitute premises approved by us and provided that you have furnished, stocked and equipped such premises to bring the Franchised Restaurant at its substituted premises into full compliance with the then-current specifications and standards before the expiration date of this Agreement;\n\n    3.    You have given us written notice of your desire to renew at least six (6) months but not more than twelve (12) months prior to the end of the term;\n\n    4.    You have satisfied all of your monetary obligations to us and our affiliates and have timely met these obligations throughout the term of this Agreement;\n\n    5.    You have executed for the renewal term our then-current form of Franchise Agreement (with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that the agreement relates to the grant of a renewal franchise), which shall supersede in all respects this Agreement, and the terms of which may differ from the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, a different percentage Continuing Fee and advertising contribution; provided, however, that the percentage Continuing Fee shall not exceed seven percent (7%) during any renewal period.  You will not be required to pay the then-current initial franchise fee or its equivalent;\n\n    6.    You have complied with our then-current qualification and training requirements; and\n\n    7.    You have executed a general release, in a form prescribed by us, of all claims against us and our affiliates, and respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders and employees.\n\n       C.   Within ninety (90) days of our receipt of your notice to renew, we will furnish you with written notice of:  (i) reasons which could cause us not to grant a renewal to you including but not limited to any deficiencies which require correction and a schedule for correction by you; and (ii) our then-current requirements relating to the image, appearance, decoration, furnishing, equipping and stocking of Buffalo Wild Wings businesses, and a schedule for effecting upgrading or modifications in order to bring the Franchised Restaurant in compliance, as a condition of renewal.  Renewal of the franchise shall be conditioned upon your compliance with such requirements and continued compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement up to the date of termination of the initial term.\n\n          3\n\n       D.   We shall give you written notice of our election not to renew the franchise at least three (3) months prior to the expiration of the initial or first renewal term of this Agreement.\n\nIII.   RESTAURANT AND LOCATION\n\n       A.   You shall operate the Franchised Restaurant only at the location specified in Paragraph I of this Agreement.  If the lease for the site of the Franchised Restaurant expires or terminates for reasons other than your breach, or if the site is destroyed, condemned or otherwise rendered unusable, or as otherwise may be agreed upon in writing by us and you, we will grant permission for relocation of the Franchised Restaurant within your Designated Area at a location and site acceptable to us.  Any such relocation shall be at your sole expense and we shall have the right to charge you for any and all reasonable costs incurred by us, and a reasonable fee for our services, in connection with any such relocation of the Franchised Restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\n       B.   You shall be responsible for purchasing or leasing a suitable site for the Franchised Restaurant.  Prior to the acquisition by lease or purchase of any site for the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, you shall submit a description of the proposed site to us, together with a letter of intent or other evidence satisfactory to us which confirms your favorable prospects for obtaining the proposed site.  We shall provide you written notice of approval or disapproval of the proposed site within fifteen (15) business days after receiving your written proposal.  Our approval is not a determination or warranty that the proposed site will be a profitable location for the Franchised Restaurant.\n\n       C.   After receiving our written approval of the location of the Franchised Restaurant as provided in Paragraph III.B. above, you shall, subject to our prior approval of terms, execute a lease (if the premises are to be leased) or a binding agreement to purchase the site.  All leases pertaining to the Franchised Restaurant premises must contain an Addendum in the form of EXHIBIT C attached hereto, or contain terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in EXHIBIT C that we approve.  You shall provide us with a copy of the executed lease for the Franchised Restaurant within five (5) days of its execution, and prior to its execution, provide us with a copy for our approval.  A copy of the executed Addendum must also be provided to us.\n\n       D.   You shall promptly after obtaining possession of the site for the Franchised Restaurant: (i) retain the services of an architect and a contractor each of whom has been approved by us; (ii) have prepared and submitted for our approval a site survey and basic architectural plans and specifications (not for construction) consistent with our general atmosphere, image, color scheme and ambience requirements as set forth from time to time in the Manuals for a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant (including requirements for dimensions, exterior design, materials, interior design and layout, equipment, fixtures, furniture, signs and decorating); (iii) obtain all required zoning changes, building, utility, health, sanitation, liquor and sign permits and licenses and any other required permits and licenses; (iv) purchase or lease equipment, fixtures, furniture and signs as provided herein; (v) complete the construction and/or remodeling, equipment, fixtures, furniture and sign installation and decorating of the Franchised Restaurant in full and strict compliance with plans and specifications therefore approved by us and all applicable ordinances, building codes and permit requirements; (vi) obtain all customary contractors' sworn statements and partial and final waivers of lien for construction, remodeling, decorating and installation services; and (vii) otherwise complete development of and have the Franchised Restaurant ready to open and commence the conduct of its business in accordance with Paragraph XII of this Agreement.  Our approval of your site survey and architectural plans is not a representation or warranty of any type.\n\n       E.   You shall be required to periodically make reasonable capital expenditures to remodel, modernize and redecorate the premises of the Franchised Restaurant so that the Franchised Restaurant will reflect the then-image intended to be portrayed by Buffalo Wild Wings businesses.  All remodeling, modernization, or redecoration of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant must be done in accordance with the standards and specifications as prescribed by us from time to time and with our prior written approval.  All replacements must\n\n          4\n\nconform to our then-current quality standards and specifications and must be approved in writing.  Your total expenditures during the term of the Franchise Agreement for such remodeling, modernizing and redecorating will not exceed ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND Dollars ($100,000.00) adjusted for inflation from the date of this Agreement.  Maintenance of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant and modifying or replacing equipment may exceed this amount, and maintenance costs and equipment costs may not be credited to remodeling, modernization or redecoration expenditures.\n\nIV.

The training program covers material aspects of the operation of a Buffalo Wild Wings business, including financial controls, general bookkeeping procedures, food preparation, service and operational techniques, familiarization with recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and advertising techniques, sanitation and maintenance procedures, deployment of labor, and maintenance of quality standards.  We reserve the right to provide less training if you have one or more Franchised Restaurants in operation.  All expenses incurred by you and your employees in attending the program, including without limitation, travel costs, room and board expenses, and the employee compensation shall be your sole responsibility.\n\n       B.   We will, from time to time upon your written request, make available, at your expense, training for additional managers designated by you and approved by us.  Such training shall take place at our Cincinnati, or Columbus, Ohio training facilities or such other place as we may designate.  You acknowledge that the time period within which we provide additional training will be subject to available openings in our regular training program with preference being given to initial training for new franchisees.\n\n       C.   We will schedule the opening of your Franchised Restaurant.  For one (1) week prior to and one (1) week concurrent with the commencement of operations of the Franchised Restaurant, we will furnish to you, at your\n\n\n\n\n\nRestaurant and at our expense, one (1) or more of our representatives for the purpose of training your employees and management team in the operation of a Franchised Restaurant.  During this period, the representatives will assist in establishing and standardizing procedures and techniques essential to the operation of a Buffalo Wild Wings business.  If you request additional assistance from us in order to facilitate the opening of the Franchised Restaurant, and if, we, in our discretion, deem it necessary, feasible and appropriate to comply with the request, you will reimburse us for our expenses in providing such additional assistance, which may include our then-current service fee.  You agree that during the week preceding the opening, you will have four (4) full days during which the Restaurant is fully operational and will host two (2) opening parties.\n\n       D.

At least three (3) persons actively involved in the management and operation of the Franchised Restaurant must successfully complete the training program.  If you fail to provide three (3) persons who can complete the training program, we will have the right to terminate this Agreement and you will not be entitled to a refund of any portion of the franchise fees paid.\n\n       E.   From time to time we may provide and if we do, may require that previously-trained and experienced franchisees, their managers and/or employees attend and successfully complete refresher training programs or seminars to be conducted at our training facility or at such other place as we shall designate. Attendance at such refresher training programs or seminars will be at your sole expense, provided, however, that attendance will not be required at more than two (2) such programs in any calendar year.\n\n          5\n\nV.     PROPRIETARY MARKS\n\n       A.   You acknowledge that our parent company is the owner of all right, title and interest together with all the goodwill of the Marks and has licensed the use of such Marks to us with the right to sublicense others.  You further acknowledge that your right to use the Marks is derived solely from this Agreement and is limited to the conduct of business by you pursuant to and in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable standards, specifications, and operating procedures prescribed by us from time to time during the term of the Agreement.

You will not, at any time during the term of this Agreement or after its termination or expiration, contest the validity or ownership of any of the Marks or assist any other person in contesting the validity or ownership of the Marks.  All provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Marks apply to any and all additional trademarks, service marks, and commercial symbols authorized for use by and licensed to you by us after the date of this Agreement.\n\n       B.   You will not use any Mark or portion of any Mark as part of a corporate or trade name, or with any prefix, suffix, or other modifying words, terms, designs, or symbols, or in any modified form.  You will not use any Mark in connection with the sale of any unauthorized product or service or in any other manner not expressly authorized in writing by us.  You shall give such notices of trademark and service mark registrations as we specify and to obtain such fictitious or assumed name registrations as may be required under applicable law.  Your use of any of the Marks on the Internet/World Wide Web (including any Home Page) or any other medium must have our prior written approval.  We reserve the right to prohibit your use of the Marks on the Internet.\n\n       C.   You will promptly notify us of any claim, demand or cause of action based upon or arising from any attempt by any other person, firm or corporation to use the Marks or any colorable imitation of the Marks.  You shall also notify us of any action, claim or demand against you relating to the Marks within ten (10) days after you receive notice of said action, claim or demand.  Upon receipt of timely notice of an action, claim or demand against you relating to the Marks, we and our affiliate shall have the sole right and duty to defend any such action.  We and our affiliate will have the exclusive right to contest or bring action against any third party regarding the third party's use of any of the Marks and will exercise such right in our and our affiliate's sole discretion.  In any defense or prosecution of any litigation relating to the Marks or components of the System undertaken by us, you shall cooperate in all respects with us and our affiliate and execute any and all documents and take all actions as may be desirable or necessary in the opinion of our counsel, to carry out such defense or prosecution.  Both parties shall make every effort consistent with the foregoing to protect, maintain, and promote the Marks as identifying the System and only the System.\n\n       D.   If, in our sole discretion, it becomes advisable at any time, for us to modify or discontinue use of any Mark, and/or use one or more additional or substitute trade names, trademarks, service marks, or other commercial symbols, either systemwide or with respect to use by any selected franchisee, you will comply with our directions within a reasonable time after notice to you.  We will have no liability or obligation whatsoever with respect to your modification or discontinuance of any Mark.\n\n       E.   In order to preserve the validity and integrity of the Marks and\n\n\n\n\n\ncopyrighted material licensed to you and to assure that you are properly employing the same in the operation of your Franchised Restaurant, we and our agents have the right of entry and inspection of your premises and operating procedures at all reasonable times.  We will have the right to observe the manner in which you are rendering your services and conducting your operations, to confer with your employees and customers, and to select Menu Items, ingredients, food and\n\n          6\n\nnon-food products, beverages, and other items, products, delivery vehicles, products and supplies for test of content and evaluation purposes to make certain that the Menu Items, ingredients, food and non-food products, beverages and other items, products, delivery vehicles, materials and supplies are satisfactory and meet our quality control provisions and performance standards.\n\nVI.    CONFIDENTIAL MANUALS\n\n       A.   We will loan to you during the term of the franchise one (1) copy of our Confidential Operations Manual and other confidential manuals and written materials (all of which are collectively referred to herein as the \"Manuals\") containing reasonable, mandatory and suggested specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed from time to time by us for Buffalo Wild Wings businesses and information relative to your other obligations.  You will not at any time, without our prior written consent, copy, duplicate, record or otherwise reproduce the Manuals in whole or in part or otherwise make the same available to any person.  Any authorized duplication or copying of any of the Manuals shall be performed by us at your expense.  We have the right to add to and otherwise modify, combine, or replace the Manuals from time to time to reflect changes in the specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed by us for Buffalo Wild Wings businesses, provided that no such addition or modification shall alter your fundamental status and rights under this Franchise Agreement.\n\n       B.   The Manuals shall at all times remain our sole property and shall promptly be returned upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n       C.   The Manuals contain our proprietary information which you shall keep confidential both during the term of the franchise and subsequent to the expiration and/or termination of the franchise.  You will at all times insure that your copy of the Manuals are available at the Franchised Restaurant premises in a current and up-to-date manner.  At all times that the Manuals are not in use by authorized personnel, you will maintain the Manuals in a locked receptacle at the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, and will only grant authorized personnel, as defined in the Manuals, access to the key or lock combination of such receptacle.  In the event of any dispute as to the contents of the Manuals, the terms of the master copy of the Manuals maintained by us at our home office will be controlling.\n\nVII.        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n       A.   You acknowledge that your entire knowledge of the operation of a Buffalo Wild Wings business, including, without limitation, the method of preparation of Menu Items and other food products, and other specifications, recipes, standards and operating procedures of a Buffalo Wild Wings business is derived from information disclosed to you by us and that such information is proprietary, confidential and our trade secret.  You will maintain the absolute confidentiality of all such information during and after the term of the franchise and you will not use any such information in any other business or in any manner not specifically authorized or approved in writing by us.\n\n       B.   You will divulge such confidential information only to the extent and only to such of your employees as must have access to it in order to operate the Franchised Restaurant.  Any and all information, knowledge and know-how, including, without limitation, drawings, materials, equipment, techniques, restaurant systems, product formulae, recipes and other data which we designate as confidential will be deemed confidential for purposes of this Agreement, except information: 1) which you can demonstrate lawfully came to your attention prior to disclosure thereof by us, or 2) which, at the time of disclosure by us to you, had lawfully become a part of the public domain, through publication or communication by others, or 3) which, after disclosure to you by us, lawfully becomes a part of the public domain, through publication or communication by others.\n\n          7\n\n       C.   Due to the special and unique nature of our confidential information, Marks and Manuals, you acknowledge that we will be entitled to immediate equitable remedies, including but not limited to, restraining orders and injunctive relief in order to safeguard our proprietary, confidential, unique, and special information and you acknowledge that money damages alone would be an insufficient remedy with which to compensate us for any breach of the terms of Paragraph V, VI and VII of this Agreement.  All of your employees having access to our confidential and proprietary information and all of your shareholders, directors, officers, partners and/or members will be required to execute non-disclosure agreements in the form acceptable to us.\n\nVIII.       MODIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM\n\n       You acknowledge that from time to time we may change or modify the System presently identified by the Marks, including, without limitation, the adoption and use of new or modified trade names, trademarks, service marks or copyrighted\n\n\n\n\n\nmaterials, new Menu Items, new products, new equipment or new techniques.  You will accept, use and display for the purpose of this Agreement any such changes in the System, as if they were part of this Agreement at the time of execution. You will make such expenditures as are reasonably required by such changes or modifications in the System.  Except as directed by us, you will not change, modify or alter the System in any way.\n\nIX. ADVERTISING\n\n       Recognizing the value of advertising and the importance of the standardization of advertising and promotion to the furtherance of the goodwill and the public image of Buffalo Wild Wings businesses, you agree:\n\n       A.   Before using any promotional and advertising materials, you will submit to us or our designated agency, for our prior approval, all information pertaining to promotional materials and advertising initiated by you, including, but not limited to, newspapers, radio and television advertising, Internet or any other medium, specialty and novelty items, signs, boxes, napkins, bags and wrapping papers.  In the event written disapproval of any such advertising and promotional material has not been given by us to you within twenty (20) days from the date such information has been received by us, the materials will be deemed approved.  Your failure to conform with these provisions and subsequent nonaction by us to require you to cure or remedy any such failure and default will not be deemed a waiver of future or additional failures and defaults by you under this provision and/or any other provision of this Agreement.  The submission of advertising information to us for our approval will not affect your right to determine the prices at which you sell your products and/or services.\n\n       B.   You will contribute to the Buffalo Wild Wings Advertising and Development Fund (\"Fund\") (which may be one of several regional Funds, if we elect to establish separate Funds to serve various regions in which multiple franchisees are located) an amount equal to three percent (3%) of your Gross Sales, as defined in Paragraph X.  Your required payments to the Fund will be made on or before the fifteenth day of the month for the preceding month.  These contributions may be withdrawn from your bank account as provided in Paragraph X.  We will use such funds to conduct local, regional or national advertising. Such payments shall be made in addition to and exclusive of any sums that you may be required to spend on system or grand opening advertising and promotion. The Fund shall be maintained and administered by us or our designee, as follows:\n\n    1.    We will oversee all advertising programs and have sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials and media used in such programs including the placement and allocation.  We will use the Fund to conduct national advertising, and/or, if regional Funds are developed, to conduct regional or local advertising on your behalf, at our sole discretion.  We may also use such funds to conduct advertising in your local advertising market. However, we cannot and do not ensure that any particular franchisee will benefit directly or pro rata from the placement of advertising.\n\n          8\n\n    2.    For each of our company-owned and affiliate-owned Restaurants (except Special Sites identified in Paragraph I.C.) offering products and services similar to the Franchised Restaurant we will make contributions to the Fund or to regional Funds equivalent to the contributions required of Franchised Restaurants within the System or, if applicable, region in which the company-owned or affiliate-owned store is located.\n\n    3.    We will administer and control the Fund and we will have the absolute and unilateral right to determine how, when and where the monies in the Fund will be spent.  This includes the right to use Fund monies for (1) the creation, development and production of advertising and promotional materials, (2) any marketing or related research and development, and (3) advertising and marketing expenses, including without limitation, the absolute right to purchase and pay for product and food research and development, advertising materials, production costs, brochures, ad slicks, radio, film and television commercials, videotapes, newspaper, magazine and other print advertising, direct mail pieces, photographer costs, photographs, pictures, designs, services provided by advertising agencies, public relations firms or other marketing, research or consulting firms or agencies, market research and marketing surveys, menu design and graphics, customer incentive programs, sponsorships, marketing meetings and sales incentives, development of Home Pages on the Internet, Internet access provider costs, Internet/World Wide Web programming and advertising, subscriptions to industry newsletters or magazines, marketing or industry studies, books and research materials, administrative costs and salaries for marketing support personnel.  All sums paid by you to the Fund will be maintained in a separate account from our other funds and shall not be used to defray any of our general operating expenses, except for such reasonable administrative costs and overhead, if any, as we may incur in activities reasonably related to the administration or direction of the Fund and advertising programs including, without limitation, costs incurred in collecting and accounting for assessments for the Fund.\n\n    4.    It is our intent that all contributions to the Fund will be expended for advertising and promotional purposes during our fiscal year within which contributions are made.  Any monies not expended in the fiscal year in which they were contributed will be applied and used for Fund expenses in the following year.\n\n    5.    Although we intend the Fund to be of perpetual duration, we have the right to terminate the Fund.  We will not terminate the Fund, however, until all monies in the Fund have been expended for advertising and promotional purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n    6.    An unaudited accounting of Fund contributions and expenditures will be prepared annually and will be made available to you upon request.  At our option, any such annual accounting may include an audit of the contributions and expenditures of the Fund prepared by an independent certified public accountant selected by us and prepared at the expense of the Fund.\n\n    7.    Once you make contributions to the Fund, all such monies will be used as required by this Paragraph IX and will not be returned to you.        C.   In addition to your contributions to the Fund, you may be required to spend up to two percent (2%) of your Gross Sales on approved local advertising.  We may direct that your local advertising expenditures be made either individually or to a local advertising group as described below.\n\n    1.    We shall have the right to designate local advertising markets and you will participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs in your designated local advertising market as described in this Paragraph.  Each Buffalo Wild Wings and bw-3 Restaurant (except Special Sites identified in Paragraph I.C.) within the designated local advertising area shall be a member of the local advertising group and each member shall have one vote on all matters requiring a vote.  We reserve the right to designate the Bylaws which will govern the operation of local advertising groups.\n\n          9\n\n    2.    If we direct you to spend your advertising funds locally, all such expenditures will be made directly by you or the local advertising group, subject to approval and direction by us or our designated advertising agency. You acknowledge that we may direct local advertising to be spent according to a seasonally adjusted schedule; however, such expenditures shall not exceed two percent (2%) of your annual Gross Sales.  You shall furnish to us an accurate accounting of all expenditures on local advertising and promotion.\n\n    3.    You will submit documentation of your advertising expenditures at such times and in such form as we designate.  If you fail to make any required advertising expenditures, we have the right to require you to contribute the amount of any deficiency to the Fund to be used by us for general advertising and promotion.\n\n       D.   We may require you to expend up to FIVE THOUSAND Dollars ($5,000) on newspaper, direct mail or advertising through other media prior to your opening and during your initial ninety (90) days of operation of the Franchised Restaurant.  We retain the right to collect such funds directly from you and expend the funds on your behalf.  Such advertising and promotion will be designated as \"Grand Opening\" advertising and promotion and will be conducted in accordance with the specifications set forth in the Manuals.\n\n       E.   You must carry and offer for sale to your customers a representative supply of trademarked clothing.  We may, from time to time, develop and market special promotional items which will be made available to you at our cost plus a reasonable mark up and you will maintain a representative inventory of such promotional items to meet public demand.  You will have the right to purchase alternative promotional items provided that such alternative goods conform to the specifications and quality standards established by us.  You will, on an annual basis, participate in a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the promotional programs introduced by us from time to time.  You will participate in the specific promotional programs designated by us.\n\n       F.   You will maintain a business phone and advertise continuously in the classified or Yellow Pages of a local telephone directory approved by us or such other directories under the listing \"Restaurant\", or such other listings as deemed appropriate by us using mats of the type and size approved in advance by us.  We reserve the right to require you to advertise in more than one local telephone directory.  When more than one (1) Buffalo Wild Wings and/or bw-3 restaurant serves a metropolitan area, classified advertisements shall list all such restaurants operating within the distribution area of the classified directories, and you shall contribute your equal share in the cost of such advertisement.\n\n       G.   You will not use in advertising or any other form of promotion, or in any manner any of the marks without the appropriate -Registered Trademark- registration mark or the designations TM or SM where applicable.\n\nX.     CONTINUING FEE\n\n       A.   You will pay us without offset, credit or deduction of any nature, so long as this Agreement is in effect, a monthly Continuing Fee equal to five percent (5%) of the Gross Sales derived from the Franchised Restaurant.  The Continuing Fee will be paid monthly in the manner specified below or as otherwise prescribed in the Manuals.\n\n    1.    We must receive from you within five (5) days after the end of each month, a correct statement of your Gross Sales for the preceding fiscal month as determined by us on a form approved by us and signed by you.  Each monthly statement of Gross Sales shall be accompanied by the Continuing Fee payment based on the Gross Sales reported in the statement so submitted.  You will make available to us all original books and records that we may deem necessary to ascertain your Gross Sales for reasonable inspection at reasonable times.\n\n          10\n\n    2.    The term \"Gross Sales\", as used in this Agreement, means and\n\n\n\n\n\nincludes the total amount of all revenue from the sale of services, products and merchandise and all income of every kind and nature related to the Franchised Restaurant whether or not sold or performed at or from the Franchised Restaurant and the proceeds from all games, cover charges, service, license, use and similar fees collected by the Franchised Restaurant.  Gross sales do not include any sales tax, use tax, or service taxes collected and paid to the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n       B.   Prior to the opening of your Restaurant (and thereafter as requested by us), you shall execute and deliver to us, our bank(s) and your bank, as necessary, all forms and documents that we may request to permit us to debit your account, either by check, via electronic funds transfer or other means or such alternative methods as we may designate (\"Payment Methods\").  You must comply with all procedures specified by us from time to time to take such actions as we may request to assist in utilizing any of the Payment Methods.  We may use the Payment Methods to collect the amount of each month's Continuing Fee, Advertising Contributions, and any other amounts due to us or our affiliates under this Agreement or otherwise.  The Continuing Fee shall be withdrawn from your designated bank account by electronic fund transfer on the fifth of each month for the previous month, or if the fifth falls on a weekend or bank holiday, then on the next business day.  Advertising Contributions will be withdrawn on the fifteenth of each month or on the next business day. Payments for commissary purchases will be debited one business day after products are delivered to the Restaurant.  We will determine your Gross Sales by means of the approved information system, or if we are unable to do so, you shall report your Gross Sales in writing on or before the fifth day of the month for the preceding month.  You shall notify us at least twenty (20) days before closing or changing the account against which such debits are to be made.  If such account is closed or ceases to be used, you shall immediately provide all documents and information necessary to permit us to debit the amounts due from an alternative account.  You acknowledge that these requirements are only a method to facilitate prompt and timely payment of amounts due and shall not affect any obligation or liability for amounts owed.  If for any reason your account cannot be electronically debited, you shall submit payments by check (certified or cashier's check if requested by us) on or before the dates when due.  You shall indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against all claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses resulting from any dishonored debit against your account, regardless whether resulting from the act or omission of you or your bank; provided that you shall not be obligated to indemnify us for any dishonored debit caused by our negligence or mistake.\n\n       C.   All Continuing Fees, Advertising Contributions, amounts due for purchases by you from us and our affiliates, and other amounts which you owe us or our affiliates shall bear interest after due date at the highest applicable legal rate for open account business credit, not to exceed one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month.  You acknowledge that this Paragraph does not constitute agreement by us or our affiliates to accept such payments after same are due or a commitment by us to extend credit to, or otherwise finance your operation of, the Franchised Restaurant.  Further, you acknowledge that your failure to pay all amounts when due shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement, as provided in Paragraph XVI hereof, notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph.\n\n       D.   Notwithstanding any designation by you, we have the sole discretion to apply any payments by you to any past due indebtedness of yours for Continuing Fees, Advertising Contributions, purchases from us and our affiliates, interest or any other indebtedness.  Further, if you are delinquent in the payment of any fees or indebtedness we have the right to require you to prepay estimated Continuing Fees and Advertising Contributions.\n\nXI.    ACCOUNTING AND RECORDS\n\n       A.   You will maintain during the term of this Agreement, and preserve for the time period specified by us, full, complete, and accurate books, records, and accounts in accordance with the standard accounting\n\n          11\n\nsystem prescribed by us from time to time in writing.  You will retain for a period of three (3) years all books and records related to the Franchised Restaurant, including without limitation, sales checks, purchase orders, invoices, payroll records, customer lists, check stubs, sales tax records and returns, cash receipts and disbursement journals and general ledgers.  If a computerized accounting system is developed by us for use throughout the franchise System, you will at your expense implement and utilize such a system according to the standards and procedures established by us.\n\n       B.   You will supply to us on or before the twenty-eighth (28th) day after the end of each fiscal quarter, in the form approved by us, an activity report and a detailed profit and loss statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flow for the last preceding fiscal quarter.  Additionally, you will, at your expense, submit to us within ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal year during the term of this Agreement, a detailed profit and loss statement and statement of cash flow for such fiscal year and a balance sheet as of the last day of such fiscal year, prepared on an accrual basis including all adjustments necessary for fair presentation of the financial statements.  Such financial statements must be certified to be true and correct by you and be reviewed by an independent certified public account.\n\n       C.   You will submit to us such other periodic reports, forms and records as specified, and in the manner and at the time as specified in the Manuals or as we otherwise require in writing from time to time.\n\n       D.   You will record all sales on electronic cash registers approved by\n\n\n\n\n\nus or on such other types of cash registers as may be designated by us in the Manuals or otherwise in writing.  We reserve the right to designate the information system used in your Franchised Restaurant including the computer hardware, software, other equipment and enhancements.  At such time as we designate the approved information system, you will have one hundred eighty (180) days in which to install and commence using the approved information system.  In connection with the approved information system, you agree to the following:\n\n    1.    You understand that you will be required to acquire the right to use the information system, obtain peripheral equipment and accessories and arrange for required maintenance and support services, all at your cost.\n\n    2.    We shall have the right at all times to access the information system and to retrieve, analyze, download and use all software, data and files stored or used on the information system.  We may access the information system in the Franchised Restaurant or from other locations.  You shall store all data and information on the information system that we designate from time to time.\n\n    3.    All modifications and enhancements made to the approved information system shall be our property (or the appropriate vendor if we so designate), without regard to the source of the modification or enhancement. You agree to execute any documents, in the form provided by us, that we determine are necessary to reflect such ownership.\n\n    4.    Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, you shall allow our employees or agents to remove the required software from the information system, shall immediately return to us the software, each component thereof, any data generated by the use thereof, all documentation for the software and other materials or information that relate to or reveal the software and its operation.  You shall immediately destroy any and all back-up or other copies of the software or parts thereof, and any data generated by the use of the software (other than financial information relating solely to you).\n\n    5.    You acknowledge and agree that there will be fees payable by you in connection with the installation, use, support, maintenance, and periodic enhancements of the approved information system.  These fees will include but are not necessarily limited to an on-site installation and support fee,\n\n          12\n\nsoftware support fees and software maintenance fees.  These fees will be payable to us or a vendor designated by us and may be increased from time to time.\n\n    6.    You will be required to execute a software license agreement setting forth in more detail your rights and obligations in connection with your use of the approved information system.\n\nYou agree that we have the right to use your data as part of our earnings claim in our Franchise Offering Circular.\n\n       E.   We or our designated agents have the right at all reasonable times to examine and copy, at our expense, your books, records, and tax returns.  We also have the right, at any time, to have an independent audit made of your books and records at our expense.  If an inspection reveals that any payments due to us have been understated in any report to us, then you will immediately pay to us the amount understated upon demand, in addition to interest from the date such amount was due until paid, at the maximum rate permitted by law not to exceed one and half percent (1.5%) per month.  If an inspection discloses an understatement in any report of two percent (2%) or more, you will also reimburse us for any and all costs and expenses connected with the inspection (including, without limitation, reasonable accounting and attorneys' fees), and we will thereafter have the right to require you to submit annual financial statements, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, audited by an independent certified public accountant.  The foregoing remedies shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have.\n\n       F.   You acknowledge that nothing contained in this Agreement constitutes our agreement to accept any payments after they are due or a commitment by us to extend credit to or otherwise finance your operation of the Franchised Restaurant.  Further, you acknowledge that your failure to pay all amounts when due constitutes a material default of, and grounds for, termination of this Agreement.\n\nXII.   STANDARDS OF QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\n\n       In order to promote and protect the value of the Marks and the System, and to insure optimum quality control as to products and services provided and sold in Franchised Restaurants, you acknowledge and agree that substantial uniformity must be maintained in the quality, type and standard of Franchised Restaurant, and in their facilities, products, services and operations. Therefore, you will comply with all requirements described in this Agreement, the Manuals and other written policies supplied by us.  Mandatory specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules prescribed from time to time by us in the Manuals or otherwise communicated to you in writing, shall constitute provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.  All references herein to this Agreement shall include all such mandatory specifications, standards and operating procedures and rules.\n\n       A.   You will commence operation of your Franchised Restaurant within nine (9) months of the execution of this Agreement or as otherwise required or approved in writing by us.  Before opening, you will have procured all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals, including, but not limited to, liquor and construction permits; hired and trained personnel, made all leasehold\n\n\n\n\n\nimprovements, and acquired initial inventory.  At the time of opening you must have a minimum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in immediately accessible working capital funds to be used solely to defray the costs of operating the Restaurant for the initial several months.  If for any reason you fail to commence operation within the nine (9) month period, we may terminate this Agreement immediately upon delivery of written notice of termination to you.\n\nB.     You will maintain the condition and appearance of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant consistent with our quality controls and standards.

If at any time in our judgment the general state of repair or the appearance of the premises of the Franchised Restaurant or its equipment, fixtures, signs or decor does not meet our quality control and standards therefor, we will notify you, specifying the action to be taken by you to correct such deficiency.  If you fail or refuse to initiate a bona fide program to complete any required maintenance, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, we will have the right, but not the obligation, in addition to all other remedies, to enter upon the premises of the Franchised Restaurant and effect such repairs, painting, maintenance or replacements of equipment, fixtures or signs on your behalf and you shall pay the entire costs thereof on demand.\n\n       C.   You will not make any material alterations to the premises of the Franchised Restaurant make any material replacements of or alterations to the equipment, fixtures or signs of the Franchised Restaurant without our prior written approval.\n\n       D.   The Franchised Restaurant may be used solely for the purpose of conducting a Buffalo Wild Wings Franchised Restaurant.  The operating entity (corporation, partnership or limited liability company) will be dedicated solely to the operation of your Franchised Restaurant(s) and will not hold any interest in, operate or manage any other business of any kind without our prior written approval.\n\n       E.   We have developed and own proprietary sauces for use in preparing chicken wings, the weck kaiser roll and other menu items and specially prepared pocket pizza mix and \"Buffalo Breath Chili\" mix (\"Trade Secret Food Products\"). In order to protect our trade secrets and to monitor the manufacture, packaging, processing and sale of Trade Secret Food Products, we will (i) manufacture, supply, and sell Trade Secret Food Products to our franchisees; (ii) disclose the formulae for and methods for preparation of the Trade Secret Food Products to a limited number of suppliers who may be authorized by us to manufacture Trade Secret Food Products to our precise specifications and sell Trade Secret Food Products to our franchisees; and/or (iii) disclose the formulae for and methods for preparation of the pocket pizza mix and the Buffalo Breath Chili mix to you who will be authorized by us to manufacture them to our precise specifications for sale only at the location of the Franchised Restaurant specified herein, unless otherwise approved by us.  Under no circumstances will we disclose the formulae for and methods of preparation of any of our proprietary sauces to you.  You acknowledge that you may be required to purchase Trade Secret Food Products (and other products whose consistency and quality is key to the success of the System) from us or a limited number of suppliers so authorized by us and will be required to use Trade Secret Food Products as designated by us.\n\n       F.   You will offer for sale and sell at the Franchised Restaurant all Menu Items, other food and beverage products and other products that we from time to time require and shall not offer for sale or sell at the Franchised Restaurant or the premises which you occupy any unapproved products or menu items or use such premises for any purpose other than the operation of a Franchised Restaurant in full compliance with this Agreement.

In some cases we may refuse to consider an alternate supplier of certain items.

You will not be obligated to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right to determine the prices to be charged from time to time by the Franchised Restaurant and no such advice or guidance shall be deemed or construed to impose upon you any obligation to charge any fixed, minimum or maximum prices for any product offered for sale by the Franchised Restaurant.

We will have the right (but not the duty), to be exercised by notice of intent to do so within sixty (60) days after termination or expiration, to purchase for cash any or all assets of the Franchised Restaurant, including leasehold improvements, equipment, supplies, and other inventory, advertising materials, and all items bearing the Marks, at your cost or fair market value, whichever is less.  You acknowledge that, pursuant to Paragraph XVII.I. of this Agreement, all signs and sign faces bearing the Marks are specifically excluded from this provision as such signs and sign faces are deemed to be our property. If the parties cannot agree on fair market value within a reasonable time, the determination of fair market value shall be determined by an appraiser selected by us and you.  If you and we cannot agree on a single appraiser, each party shall select one appraiser, who together will select a third appraiser and the fair market value will be the average of the three (3) independent appraisers. Each party will pay their own appraiser and the cost of the third appraiser will be shared equally by the parties.  If we elect to exercise any option to purchase as herein provided, we have the right to set off all amounts due from you under this Agreement, if any, against any payment therefor.\n\n       L.   You will comply with the covenants contained in Paragraph XV of this Agreement.\n\nXVIII. TRANSFERABILITY OF INTEREST\n\n       A.   This Agreement and all rights hereunder can be assigned and transferred by us and, if so, shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of our successors and assigns.\n\n       B.   This Agreement, and your rights and obligations under it, are and shall remain personal to you.  The term \"Transfer\" shall mean any sale, assignment, gift, pledge, mortgage or any other encumbrance, transfer by bankruptcy, transfer by judicial order, merger, consolidation, share exchange, transfer by operation of law or otherwise, whether direct or indirect, voluntary or involuntary, of this Agreement or any interest in it, or any rights or obligations arising under it, or of any material portion of your assets, or of any interest in you.  You (and your shareholders, partners and members) will not directly or indirectly make a Transfer without our prior written consent.  We will not withhold our consent to a Transfer, subject to all of the following conditions being satisfied:\n\n    1.    You are in full compliance with this Agreement, you have no uncured defaults, all your fees, debts and financial obligations to us, our affiliates and the Fund are current, and you are current in your required local advertising expenditures;\n\n    2.    You execute a written agreement in a form satisfactory to us in which you and your owners covenant to observe all applicable post-term obligations and covenants contained in this Agreement;\n\n\n\n\n\n    3.    The proposed transferee enters into a written agreement in a form satisfactory to us assuming and agreeing to discharge all of your obligations and covenants under this Agreement for the remainder of its term or, at our option, execute our then-current standard form of franchise agreement (which\n\n          24\n\nmay provide for different fees, advertising requirements, duration, and other rights and obligations from those provided in this Agreement);\n\n    4.    The proposed transferee agrees in writing to perform such maintenance, remodeling and re-equipping of the Restaurant that we determine necessary to bring the Restaurant in compliance with our then-current standards;\n\n    5.    Prior to the date of the proposed Transfer, the proposed transferee's management team successfully completes such training and instruction as we deem necessary;\n\n    6.    We are satisfied that the proposed transferee (and if the proposed transferee is an entity, all holders of any interest in such entity) meets all of the requirements for our new franchisees applicable on the date we receive notice of the proposed transfer and including, but not limited to, good reputation and character, business experience, restaurant management experience, and financial strength and liquidity;\n\n    7.    You and all holders of an interest in you execute a general release, in the form prescribed by us, releasing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all claims that you or any of your investors may have against us and our affiliates, including our and their respective shareholders, officers, directors and employees, in both their individual and corporate capacities;\n\n    8.    You pay us a transfer fee equal to one-half (1/2) of the then-current Initial Franchise Fee; and\n\n    9.    We waive our right of first refusal under Paragraph XX.\n\n       C.   Application for our consent to a transfer and tender of the right of first refusal provided for in Paragraph XX, will be accompanied by the documents (including a copy of the proposed purchase or other transfer agreement) or other information required by us.  Any agreement used in connection with a transfer including a lease or management agreement, shall be subject to our prior written approval.\n\n       D.   In the event you are a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, any transfer of stock (or other form of ownership interest) constituting a controlling interest in you will be subject to the consent, right of first refusal, transfer fee and all other applicable provisions of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Paragraph XVIII, any change in the percentage you owned, directly or indirectly, by any person or entity who directly or indirectly owns an interest in you (including any addition or deletion of any such person or entity) which results in a change in forty-nine percent (49%) or more of your ownership or any series of changes in the percentage you owned, directly or indirectly, by any such person or entity (including any addition or deletion of any such person or entity) which results within a period of three (3) years in any change in forty-nine percent (49%) or more of your ownership shall be deemed a transfer of a controlling interest in you.  Any individual transfer of an interest less than a controlling interest in you or the Franchised Restaurant must have our prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, but will not be subject to our right of first refusal or the payment of the transfer fee.  You will however, reimburse us for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in approving the transfers including our attorneys' fees.  Any person who acquires any interest in you, this Agreement or the Franchised Restaurant must execute the Owner Agreement attached as EXHIBIT A to this Agreement.\n\n       E.   You will not, without our prior written consent, place in, on or upon the location of the Franchised Restaurant, or in any communication media, any form of advertising, or list with any business, real estate broker, agent, or attorney any information relating to the sale of the Franchised Restaurant or the rights granted hereunder.\n\n          25\n\nXIX.   YOUR DEATH OR INCAPACITY\n\n       A.   In the event of your death or incapacity, or the death or incapacity of any partner, any shareholder owning fifty percent (50%) or more of your capital stock, or any Member who owns a majority interest in a limited liability company, the heirs, beneficiaries, devisees, or legal representatives of said individual, partner or shareholders shall, within one hundred eighty (180) days of such event:\n\n    1.    Apply to us for the right to continue to operate the franchise for the duration of the term of this Agreement and any renewals hereof, which right shall be granted upon the fulfillment of all of the conditions set forth in Paragraph XVIII. of this Agreement (except that no transfer fee shall be required); or\n\n    2.    Sell, assign, transfer, or convey your interest in compliance with the provisions of Paragraphs XVIII and XX of this Agreement; provided,\n\n\n\n\n\nhowever, in the event a proper and timely application for the right to continue to operate has been made and rejected, the one hundred eighty (180) days to sell, assign, transfer or convey shall be computed from the date of said rejection.  For purposes of this Paragraph, our silence on an application made pursuant to Paragraph XIX.A.1. through the one hundred and eighty (180) days following the event of death or incapacity shall be deemed a rejection made on the last day of such period.\n\n       B.   In the event of the death or incapacity of an individual franchisee, or any partner or shareholder of you which is a partnership or corporation, where the aforesaid provisions of Paragraph XVIII have not been fulfilled within the time provided, all rights licensed to you under this Agreement shall, at our option, terminate forthwith and we will have the option to purchase the assets of the Franchised Restaurant in accordance with Paragraph XVII.K. herein.\n\nXX.    RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL\n\n       If you or your owners propose to sell the Franchised Restaurant (or its assets) or a controlling interest in the ownership of you as defined in Paragraph XVIII, you or your owners will obtain and deliver a bona fide, executed written offer to purchase same to us, which shall, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of such offer to us, have the right, exercisable by written notice to you or your owners, to purchase the Franchised Restaurant, (its assets) or an ownership interest in you for the price and on the terms and conditions contained in such offer, provided that we may substitute cash for any form of payment proposed in such offer.  If we do not exercise this right of first refusal, you may accept the offer, subject to our prior written approval, as provided in Paragraph XVIII hereof, provided that if such offer is not so accepted within six (6) months of the date thereof, we will again have the right of first refusal herein described.\n\nXXI.   OPERATION IN THE EVENT OF ABSENCE, DISABILITY OR DEATH\n\n       In order to prevent any interruption of the Franchised Restaurant which would cause harm to the Franchised Restaurant and thereby depreciate the value thereof, you authorize us, in the event that you are absent or incapacitated by reason of illness or death and are not, therefore, in our sole judgment, able to operate the Franchised Restaurant, to operate the Franchised Restaurant for so long as we deem necessary and practical, and without waiver of any other rights or remedies we may have under this Agreement.  Provided, however, that we shall not be obligated to so operate the Franchised Restaurant.  All monies from the operation of the business during such period of operation by us shall be kept in a separate account and the expenses of the Franchised Restaurant, including reasonable compensation and expenses for our representative, shall be charged to said account.  If, as herein provided, we temporarily operate for you the Franchised Restaurant, you will indemnify and hold us harmless and any representative of ours who may act hereunder, from any and all claims arising from\n\n          26\n\nthe operation of the Franchised Restaurant, including, without limitation, our acts and omissions and acts and omissions of our representatives.\n\nXXII.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND INDEMNIFICATION\n\n       A.   This Agreement does not make, appoint or constitute you as our agent, legal representative, joint venturer, partner, employee, or servant for any purpose whatsoever.  You cannot represent to third parties that you are our agent and it is understood between the parties that you will be an independent contractor who is in no way authorized to make any contract, agreement, warranty or representation on our behalf, or to create any obligation, express or implied, on our behalf.  As an independent entrepreneur, you are solely responsible for the control,  management and day-to-day operation of the Franchised Restaurant, including but not limited to, such matters as determining the prices at which you will offer and sell approved products and services, hiring and discharging your employees and setting and paying wages and benefits of your employees and that we will have no power, responsibility or liability with respect to such pricing, hiring, discharging, setting and paying of wages or related matters.  All standards of quality and performance, including those listed in Paragraph XII, are established to promote and protect the value of the Marks and the System and to insure optimum quality control as to products and services.  You alone are responsible for the food production and preparation at the Franchised Restaurant.\n\n       B.   You will prominently display, by posting of a sign within public view, on or in the premises of the Franchised Restaurant, a statement that clearly indicates that the Franchised Restaurant is independently owned and operated by you as a franchisee and not as an agent.\n\n       C.   You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages and liabilities, however caused, arising directly or indirectly from, as a result of, or in connection with, the use and operation of the Franchised Restaurant, as well as the costs, including attorneys' fees, of defending against them (hereinafter are \"Franchise Claims\").  Franchise Claims include, but are not limited to, those arising from any death, personal injury or property damage (whether caused wholly or in part through our active or passive negligence), latent, or other defects in the Franchised Restaurant, or your employment practices.  In the event a Franchise Claim is made against us, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to select our own legal counsel to represent our interests and you will reimburse us for our attorneys' fees immediately upon our request as they are incurred.\n\n\n\n\n\nXXIII. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       A.   Our failure to exercise any power reserved to us hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by you with any obligation or condition hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof.  Our waiver of any default by you shall not be binding unless in writing and executed by us and shall not affect or impair our right with respect to any subsequent default of the same or of a different nature.\n\n       B.   Any and all notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be personally delivered, mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent overnight courier to the respective parties at the following addresses unless and until a different address has been designated by written notice to the other party:\n\nNotices to Us:    bw-3 FRANCHISE SYSTEMS, INC.   1919 Interchange Tower   600 South Highway 169   Minneapolis, Minnesota 55426\n\n          27\n\nCopy to   Mary Beth Brody, Esq.

In the event either party brings an action to enforce the terms of this Agreement or to enjoin the violation of any of its terms and prevails, such party shall be entitled to recover all litigation costs including attorneys' fees.\n\n       D.   This Agreement and the Exhibits attached shall be construed together and constitute the entire, full and complete agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements.  No other representation has induced you to execute this Agreement, and there are no representations, inducements, promises, or agreements, oral or otherwise, between the parties not embodied herein, which are of any force or effect with reference to this Agreement or otherwise.  No amendment, change or variance from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless executed in writing, signed by both parties.\n\n       E.   Each Paragraph, part, term and/or provision of this Agreement shall be considered severable, and if, for any reason, any Paragraph, part, term and/or provision herein is determined to be invalid and contrary to, or in conflict with any existing or future law or regulation, such shall not impair the operation of or affect the remaining portions, sections, parts, terms and/or provisions of this Agreement, and the latter will continue to be given full force and effect and bind the parties hereto; and said invalid sections, parts, terms and/or provisions shall be reformed to most nearly implement the intentions of the parties hereto or, if reformation is not possible, be deemed not part of this Agreement; provided, however, that if we determine that said finding of illegality adversely affects the basic consideration of this Agreement, we may, at our option, terminate this Agreement.  Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be deemed, to confer upon any person or legal entity other than you and us and such of their respective successors and assigns as may be contemplated by this Agreement, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.\n\nXXIV.  APPLICABLE LAW\n\n       A.   THIS AGREEMENT TAKES EFFECT UPON ITS ACCEPTANCE AND EXECUTION BY US, AND SHALL BE INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE FRANCHISED RESTAURANT IS LOCATED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT GOVERNED BY THE UNITED STATES TRADEMARK ACT OF 1946 (LANHAM ACT, 15, U.S.C. SECTIONS 1051 ET SEQ).  YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US, bw-3, INC.

AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOCATION IS HENNEPIN COUNTY, MINNESOTA.  THE PARTIES DO HEREBY WAIVE ALL QUESTIONS OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION OR VENUE FOR THE PURPOSES OF CARRYING OUT THIS PROVISION.\n\n       C.   NO RIGHT OR REMEDY CONFERRED UPON OR RESERVED TO US OR YOU BY THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHALL BE DEEMED, EXCLUSIVE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY HEREIN OR BY LAW OR EQUITY PROVIDED OR PERMITTED, BUT EACH SHALL BE CUMULATIVE OF EVERY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY.\n\n       D.   NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED SHALL BAR OUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST THREATENED CONDUCT THAT WILL CAUSE US LOSS OR DAMAGES, UNDER THE USUAL EQUITY RULES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE RULES FOR OBTAINING RESTRAINING ORDERS AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS.\n\nXXV.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n       A.   The parties have entered into this Agreement in good faith and in the belief that it is mutually advantageous to them.  It is with that same spirit of cooperation that they pledge to attempt to resolve any dispute amicably without the necessity of litigation.  Accordingly, they agree that except as set forth below, if any dispute arises between them relating to this Agreement that prior to the commencement of any legal action to interpret or enforce this Agreement, they will first use the procedures specified in this Section.\n\n       B.   The party seeking to initiate the procedure shall give written notice to the other party, describing in general terms the nature of the dispute, the claim for relief and identifying one or more individuals with authority to settle the dispute on such party's behalf.  The party receiving such notice shall have ten (10) business days within which to designate by written notice one or more individuals with authority to settle the dispute on such party's behalf.\n\n       C.   The authorized individuals shall be entitled to make such investigation of the dispute as they deem appropriate, but agree to meet promptly, and in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of the initial written notice, to discuss resolution of the dispute.  The authorized individuals shall meet at such times and places and with such frequency as they may agree.  If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days from the date of their initial meeting, the parties shall cease direct negotiations and shall submit the dispute to mediation in accordance with the following procedure.\n\n       D.   The authorized individuals shall have five (5) business days from the date they cease direct negotiations to submit to each other a written list of acceptable qualified mediators not affiliated with any of the parties. Within five (5) days from the date of receipt of such list, the authorized individuals shall rank the mediators in numerical order of preference and exchange such rankings.  If one or more names are on both lists, the highest ranking person shall be designated as the mediator.  If no mediator has been selected under this procedure, the parties agree jointly to request the local administrative judge of the County in which our corporate headquarters are situated to supply within ten (10) business days a list of potential qualified mediators.  Within five (5) business days of receipt of the list, the parties shall again rank the proposed mediators in numerical order of preference and shall simultaneously exchange such lists and shall select as the mediator the individual\n\n          29\n\nreceiving the highest combined ranking.  If such mediator is not available to serve, they shall proceed to contact the mediator who was next highest in ranking until they are able to select a mediator.\n\n       E.   In consultation with the mediator selected, the parties shall promptly designate a mutually convenient time and place for the mediation, and unless circumstances require otherwise, such time is to be not later than forty-five (45) days after selection of the mediator.  In the event any party to this Agreement has substantial need for information in the possession of another party to this Agreement in order to prepare for the mediation, all parties shall attempt in good faith to agree on procedures for the expeditious exchange of such information, with the help of the mediator if required.  At least seven (7) days prior to the first scheduled session of the mediation, each party shall deliver to the mediator and to the other party a concise written summary of its views on the matter in dispute, and such other matters required by the mediator. The mediator may also request that a confidential issue paper be submitted to him by each party.\n\n       F.   In the mediation, each party shall be represented by an authorized individual and may be represented by counsel.  In addition, each party may, with permission of the mediator, bring such additional persons as are needed to respond to questions, contribute information and participate in the negotiations.\n\n       G.   The mediator shall determine the format for the meetings, designed to assure that both the mediator and the authorized individuals have an opportunity to hear an oral presentation of each party's views on the matter in dispute, and that the authorized parties attempt to negotiate a resolution of the matter in dispute, with or without the assistance of counsel or others, but with the assistance of the mediator.  To this end, the mediator is authorized to conduct both joint meetings and separate private caucuses with the parties.  The mediation session shall be private.  The mediator will keep confidential all information learned in private caucus with any party unless specifically\n\n\n\n\n\nauthorized by such party to make disclosure of the information to the other party.  The parties agree to sign a document agreeing that the mediator shall be governed by the provisions of the local Rules of Civil Procedure and such other rules as the mediator shall prescribe.  The parties commit to participate in the proceedings in good faith with the intention of resolving the dispute, if at all possible.\n\n       H.   The parties agree to participate in the mediation procedure to its conclusion.  The mediation shall be terminated (i) by the execution of a settlement agreement by the parties, (ii) by a declaration of the mediator that the mediation is terminated, or (iii) by a written declaration of a party to the effect that the mediation process is terminated at the conclusion of one full day's mediation session.  Even if the mediation is terminated without a resolution of the dispute, the parties agree not to terminate negotiations and not to commence any legal action or seek other remedies prior to the expiration of five (5) days following the mediation.  The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be shared equally by the parties.  The mediator shall be disqualified as a witness, consultant, expert or counsel for any party with respect to the dispute and any related matters.\n\n       I.   Mediation is a compromise negotiation for purposes of the Federal and State Rules of Evidence and constitutes privileged communication.  The entire mediation process is confidential, and no stenographic, visual or audio record shall be made.  All conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any party, by their agents, employees, representatives or other invitees and by the mediator are confidential and shall, in addition and where appropriate, be deemed to be privileged.  Such conduct, statements, promises, offers, views and opinions shall not be discoverable or admissible for any purposes, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties, and shall not be disclosed to anyone not an agent, employee, expert, witness, or representative of any of the parties;  provided however, that evidence otherwise discoverable or admissible is not excluded from discovery or admission as a result of its use in the mediation.\n\n          30\n\n       J.   Nothing herein contained shall bar our right to seek and obtain temporary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law against any conduct or threatened conduct by you which could impair the goodwill associated with the Marks.\n\n       K.   The parties (and their respective owners) agree to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the right to or claim for any punitive or exemplary damages against the other and agree that in the event of a dispute between them, each will be limited to the recovery of actual damages sustained.\n\nXXVI.  OWNER AGREEMENT\n\n       The franchisee (\"you\") includes all persons who succeed to the interest of the original franchisee by permitted transfer or operation of law and shall be deemed to include not only the individual or entity described in the introductory paragraph of this Agreement but shall also include all partners if you are a partnership, all shareholders if you are a corporation and all members if you are a limited liability company.

REMODELING AND DECOR.  Lessor agrees that Lessee shall have the right to remodel, equip, paint and decorate the interior of the Premises and to display such proprietary marks and signs on the interior and exterior of the Premises as Lessee is reasonably required to do pursuant to the Franchise Agreement and any successor Franchise Agreement under which Lessee may operate a Franchised Restaurant on the Premises.\n\n       2.   ASSIGNMENT.  Lessee shall have the right to assign all of its right, title and interest in the Lease to bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3 at any time during the term of the Lease, including any extensions or renewals thereof, without first obtaining Lessor's consent.  However, no assignment shall be effective until such time as bw-3 or its designated affiliate gives Lessor written notice of its acceptance of such assignment, and nothing contained herein or in any other document shall constitute bw-3 or its designated affiliate a party to the Lease, or  guarantor thereof, and shall not create any liability or obligation of bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3 unless and until the Lease is assigned to, and accepted in writing by, bw-3 or its designated affiliate.  In the event of an assignment, Lessee shall remain liable under the terms of the Lease.\n\n       3.   DEFAULT AND NOTICE.\n\n    (a)   In the event there is a default or violation by Lessee under        the terms of the Lease, Lessor shall give Lessee and bw-3 written notice        of such default or violation within a reasonable time after Lessor        receives knowledge of its occurrence.  bw-3 will notify Lessor whether it        intends to cure the default and take an automatic assignment of Lessee's        interest as provided in Paragraph 4(a).  bw-3 will have an additional        fifteen (15) days in which to cure the default or violation.\n\n    (b)   All notices to bw-3 shall be sent by registered or certified        mail, postage prepaid, to the following address:\n\n  bw-3 Franchise Systems, Inc.   1919 Interchange Tower   600 South Highway 169   Minneapolis, MN 55426\n\n\n\n\n\n          39\n\n  Attention: Chief Financial Officer bw-3 may change its address for receiving notices by giving Lessor written notice of such new address.  Lessor agrees that it will notify both Lessee and bw-3 of any change in Lessor's mailing address to which notices should be sent.\n\n       4.   TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION.\n\n    (a)   Upon the expiration or termination of either the Lease or the        Franchise Agreement, bw-3 will, at its option, have the right (but not        the requirement) to take an automatic assignment of Lessee's interest.\n\n    (b)   Upon the expiration or termination of either the Lease or the        Franchise Agreement, Landlord will cooperate with and assist us in        gaining possession of premises and if bw-3 does not elect to take an        assignment of the Lessee's interest, Lessor will allow bw-3 to enter the        Premises, without being guilty of trespass and without incurring any        liability to Lessor, to remove all signs, awnings, and all other items        identifying the Premises as a Franchised Restaurant and to make such        other modifications (such as repainting) as are reasonably necessary to        protect the bw-3 marks and system, and to distinguish the Premises from        Franchised Restaurants.  In the event bw-3 exercises its option to        purchase assets of Lessee, Lessor shall permit bw-3 to remove all such        assets being purchased by bw-3.\n\n       5.   CONSIDERATION; NO LIABILITY.\n\n    (a)   Lessor hereby acknowledges that the provisions of this        Addendum to Lease are required pursuant to the Franchise Agreement under        which Lessee plans to operate its business and the Lessee would not lease        the Premises without this Addendum.\n\n    (b)   Lessor further acknowledges that Lessee is not an agent or        employee of bw-3 and the Lessee has no authority or power to act for, or        to create any liability on behalf of, or to in any way bind bw-3 or any        affiliate of bw-3, and that Lessor has entered into this Addendum to        Lease with full understanding that it creates no duties, obligations or        liabilities of or against bw-3 or any affiliate of bw-3.\n\n       6.   SALES REPORTS.  If requested by bw-3, Lessor will provide bw-3 with whatever information Lessor has regarding Lessee's sales from the Restaurant.\n\n       7.   AMENDMENTS.  No amendment or variation of the terms of this Addendum to the Lease shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties hereto.\n\n       8.   REAFFIRMATION OF LEASE.

If negotiation does not result in a resolution within 30 days of when one Party first notifies the other of the controversy or claim, either Party may resort to arbitration under Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION].\n\n     12.2 ARBITRATION. Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 12.2  [ARBITRATION]. The arbitration will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes. The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted. If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement. Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n     12.3 EQUITABLE RELIEF. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of an alleged violation of Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] of this Agreement by either Party, the Party alleging such a violation may seek temporary injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction pending appointment of an arbitrator. The Party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall\n\n    18    19\n\nrequest that the American Arbitration Association proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.\n\n     12.4 COSTS. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each Party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 12  [DISPUTE RESOLUTION], except that costs and expenses of the arbitrators shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party.\n\n     12.5 TWO YEAR LIMITATION. Except for claims under Sections 15.4  [INDEMNIFICATION BY NEOFORMA] and 15.5  [INDEMNIFICATION BY VERTICALNET] hereof, neither Party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to this Agreement, including any claim of fraud or misrepresentation, more than two years after the cause of action accrues or\n\nSource: NEOFORMA INC, S-1/A, 12/2/1999\n\n\n\n\n\nbecomes known, whichever is later.\n\n     12.6 CONFIDENTIALITY.

In the event of (a) any material remediable breach of this Agreement by the other Party which remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach (other than a breach of a payment obligation) was received by the other Party or (b) any material breach which cannot be cured, the non-breaching Party may take reasonable remediable measures at the cost of the breaching Party without prejudice and in addition to any other rights arising from such breach. In addition, the non-breaching Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\n13. CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n     13.1 CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS. Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each Party agrees to take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) (a) to receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties and (c) to promptly notify the disclosing Party upon learning of any law, rule, regulation or court order that purports to compel disclosure of any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party and to reasonably cooperate with the disclosing Party in the exercise of the disclosing Party's right to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. Neither Party hereto shall use all or any part of the Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Parties will take Reasonable Steps (as defined below) to ensure that their employees, representatives and agents comply with this provision. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means at least the same degree of care that the receiving Party uses to protect its own Confidential Information, and, in no event, no less than reasonable care.\n\n     13.2 EXCLUSIONS. Nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party from disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to any applicable law, rule, regulation or court order; provided, however, that such Party complies with the notice provisions of Section 13.1(c)  [CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS] to the\n\n    19    20\n\nextent permissible under applicable laws, rules, regulations or court orders.

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] are reasonable and necessary to protect the other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] may result in irreparable harm to such other Party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY] by a Party hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 13  [CONFIDENTIALITY], without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond or other security.\n\n     13.5 PUBLICITY. Except as may be required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (including those arising under any securities laws), neither Party will originate any publicity, news release or other public announcement, written or oral, whether to the public press or otherwise, concerning the relationship between the Parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event disclosure is required by applicable law, rules or regulations, then the Party required to so disclose such information shall, to the extent possible, provide to the other Party for its approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) a written copy of such public announcement at least five business days prior to disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall have the right to make a press release with respect to its entering into this Agreement; provided that such Party provides to the other Party a copy of the proposed press release no less than five business days prior to its proposed release and that the contents of such press release shall be subject to the other Party's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\n\n14.

Costs. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each Party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 8, except that costs and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully initiates or opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party.  To the extent that any claim in arbitration relates to the collection of amounts owed under Article 6, the Party entitled to collect such amounts shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs of collection, including expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred.\n\n    8.5.  Two Year Limitation.

In addition, the non-breaching Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\nSource: LEADERSONLINE INC, S-1/A, 4/27/2000\n\n\n\n\n\n9.

Termination.  Subject to Section 12.12  [Survival], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or, at the request of the disclosing Party, destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement.

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 9 are reasonable and necessary to protect the other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 9 may result in irreparable harm to such other Party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate.  Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 9 by a Party hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 9, without posting a bond or other security.\n\n    9.5.  Publicity. Except as may be required by law in which case a party will provide as much advance notice as reasonably possible, neither Party will originate any press release concerning the relationship between the Parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND, ABSENT ANY OF SUCH DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE ECONOMIC TERMS, WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT. THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 28\n\n\n\n\n\n24.

If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Party or circumstances is declared void, illegal, or unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement will be valid and enforceable to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

The arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1 et seq. Arbitration awards will be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of the arbitration will be Chicago, Illinois. All aspects of the arbitration and any award will be confidential (subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 19.3).\n\n(c) The arbitrators will have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a dispute; provided, however, that the arbitrators will have no power or authority to award damages that would be inconsistent with Section 23 of this Agreement.\n\n(d) In any arbitration under this Section 28.9, the arbitrators will set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing each Party to such dispute an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the other Party about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators will rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and will have the authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, including attorneys' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification.\n\n(e) Each Party will pay its own costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of any arbitration; provided, however, that the Parties will equally share the fees and expenses of the arbitrators; provided, further, that in the event any action, suit, arbitration, or other proceeding is instituted or commenced by either Party against the other Party arising hereunder, the prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and costs of arbitration from the non-prevailing Party (it being agreed that the arbitrators and/or judge may eliminate or reduce such recovery on the grounds that it is unreasonable or disproportionate to the harm suffered). 32\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 28.9 to the contrary, either Party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary. For such purpose, each Party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any Federal court within Cook County, Illinois, and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which it might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and venue.\n\n28.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL- ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.\n\n28.11 Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges that a breach by a Party of this Agreement may cause the non-breaching Party immediate and irreparable harm, for which an award of damages may not be adequate compensation and agrees that notwithstanding Section 28.9(b), in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including in the form of orders for preliminary or permanent injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction or the arbitration panel, provided that following the formation of the arbitration panel pursuant to Section 28.9(b), such relief will only be sought from the arbitration panel. The Parties hereby waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such relief. Such remedies will not be deemed to be exclusive but will be in addition to all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law or in equity, subject to any express exclusions or limitations in this Agreement to the contrary.\n\n28.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Counterparts may be delivered by facsimile, electronic mail (including .pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. Federal ESIGN Act of 2000) or other transmission method, and any counterpart so delivered will be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.\n\n28.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all Exhibits, and the BAA, constitutes the sole and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter, including, without limitation, the Developer Agreement.

In the event that the Commercializing Party does not agree to reimburse or does not promptly reimburse the Sublicensing Party for such amounts upon request (such amounts as determined by the JDRC in accordance with this Agreement, to the extent so provided above), then such Third Party Technology shall thereafter be deemed excluded from the licenses or other subject matter licensed hereunder.\n\n(b) Right to Offset.

Ono shall carry out all such activities in accordance with the then-current Development Plan and the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n4.4 Joint Clinical Studies.\n\n(a)  Joint Clinical Study Proposals. From time to time during the term of this Agreement, either Party may submit to the JDRC a proposal for one or more joint Clinical Studies that would support the filing of Marketing Approval Applications for the Product with Regulatory Authorities in both the Ono Territory and the Array Territory (a \"Joint Clinical Study Proposal\"). Each such Joint Clinical Study Proposal shall include a draft synopsis, proposed timelines for the conduct of such studies, as well a proposed budget for such studies. The JDRC shall review and discuss each such Joint Clinical Study Proposal and shall approve or reject such Joint Clinical Study Proposal in its discretion.\n\n(i) If the JDRC approves a Joint Clinical Study Proposal, such Joint Clinical Study Proposal shall thereafter be deemed to be an \"Approved Clinical Study\" and the JDRC will create a Working Group to prepare a full development plan (\"Joint Development Plan\") covering the Approved Clinical Study based on the Joint Clinical Study Proposal. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, if such Approved Clinical Study(ies) are Global Registration Studies, then the cost of such Approved Clinical Study(ies) (including out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Parties together with FTE-costs associated with the Parties' personnel managing such Approved Clinical Study) shall be allocated eighty eight percent (88%) to Array and twelve percent (12%) to Ono.\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n(ii) In the event that the JDRC does not approve the Joint Clinical Study Proposal (or a substantially similar proposal) within sixty (60) days after such Joint Clinical Study Proposal has been submitted to the JDRC, the each Party shall be free to carry out at its own expense the relevant Clinical Study(ies) described in such Joint Clinical Study Proposal independently, subject to the terms of Sections 2.1 and 4.4(c).\n\n(b) Joint Development Plans. Pursuant to Section 4.4(a), the Working Group designated by JDRC shall in good faith discuss and prepare the Joint Development Plan covering Approved Clinical Study(ies) for review by JDRC.\n\n(i) Once Joint Development Plan prepared by the Working Group is approved at JDRC, the Parties shall initiate the Approved Clinical Study(ies) in accordance with the Joint Development Plan.\n\n(ii) In the event that the JDRC is unable to agree upon a Joint Development Plan for such Approved Clinical Study within sixty (60) days after the applicable Joint Study Proposal has been approved by the JDRC, each Party shall be free to carry out such Approved Clinical Study(ies) at its own expense independently upon notice to the other Party, and subject to the terms of Sections 2.1 and 4.4(c).\n\n(iii) The JDRC shall review the Joint Development Plan on an ongoing basis from time-to-time as needed. The JDRC may make adjustments to the then-current Joint Development Plan from time-to-time as it deems appropriate.\n\n(c)  Consequences of Rejection of Joint Clinical Study Proposals or Joint Development Plan.\n\n(i) In case of the rejection of a Joint Clinical Proposal by the JDRC pursuant to Section 4.4(a)(ii) or the inability of the Parties to agree upon a Joint Development Plan for an Approved Clinical Study as described in Section 4.4(b)(ii), each Party may, upon notice to the other Party, conduct the relevant Clinical Study described in the Joint Clinical Study Proposal (hereinafter the \"Declined Clinical Study\") at its own expense, subject to Section 2.1 above; provided, however, that:\n\n(A) any Declined Clinical Study conducted by Ono (or its Affiliates or Sublicensees) shall be conducted solely within the Ono Territory;\n\n(B) each Party, should it elect to conduct any Declined Clinical Study on its own shall keep the JDRC and the other Party informed as to the design of any such Declined Clinical Study(ies) to be conducted by or under its authority;\n\n(C) any Declined Clinical Study conducted by Array or PFM shall be permitted to include clinical sites within the Ono Territory to the extent consistent with the requirements of Section 4.5;\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n(D) if the Party that is not conducting a Declined Clinical Study (the \"Non-Performing Party\") determines reasonably and in good faith that the Declined Clinical Study is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Development or Commercialization of the Products in the Field, then the Party performing such Declined Clinical Study (the \"Performing Party\") shall not undertake such Declined Clinical Study unless and until the JDRC determines that such Declined Clinical Study should be permitted; and\n\n(E) The Performing Party shall provide formal written reports of the results of the Declined Clinical Study and the costs of such Declined Clinical to the Non-Performing Party when such written reports are available, and the JDRC during meetings of the JDRC, upon request of the other Party but not more than twice a year during the period in which any study within the Declined Clinical Study is being performed. For clarity, Section 18.11 shall apply with respect to Declined Clinical Studies undertaken by either Party in accordance with this Section 4.4(c).\n\n(ii) Costs of Declined Clinical Studies and Use of related Data. The Performing Party shall bear all costs associated with Declined Clinical Studies it undertakes. If Ono (or an Ono Affiliate or Sublicensee) submits to a Regulatory Authority in Ono Territory Data generated by Array (including its Affiliates) or a Third Party Partner pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study (either directly or by reference under Section 4.8 below) for purposes of obtaining new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product for the same Indication that was the subject of study in such Declined Clinical Study, Ono shall reimburse Array an amount equal to [ * ] of the costs incurred by Array (including by its Affiliates) and/or such Third Party Partner for the Declined Clinical Study. If Array (including its Affiliates) and/or PFM submits to a Regulatory Authority in the Array Territory Data generated by Ono pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study (either directly or by reference under Section 4.8 below) for purposes of obtaining new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product for the same Indication that was the subject of study in such Declined Clinical Study, Array shall reimburse Ono an amount equal to [ * ] of the costs incurred by Ono (including by its Affiliates) for the Declined Clinical Study. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Ono is the Non-Performing Party and the PMDA (or MHLW), based on the fact that the Declined Clinical Study utilized clinical sites in Japan, compels Ono to file for a new or expanded Marketing Approval for the Product based on the Data generated by Array pursuant to a Declined Clinical Study, then the foregoing obligation to reimburse Array [ * ] of the costs of the Declined Clinical Study shall be waived.\n\n(d) Except for Investigator Sponsored Clinical Studies included in the Existing Clinical Studies, neither Party shall authorize or support an Investigator Sponsored Clinical Study or any Post-Approval Marketing Clinical Study in the other Party's territory without obtaining prior written consent.\n\n(e) Development Efforts; Manner of Performance; Reports.\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n(i) Development Efforts.

If Laws or regulations require withholding by Ono of any taxes imposed upon Array on account of any royalties or other payments paid under this Agreement, such taxes shall be deducted by Ono as required by Law from such payment and shall be paid by Ono to the proper taxing authorities. Ono shall use Diligent Efforts to secure official receipts of payment of any withholding tax and shall send them to Array as evidence of such payment. Array shall provide to Ono any taxation documents (Form 3 and Form 17), and the Residency Certificate of Array issued by the US Internal Revenue Service (which Residency Certificate is effective for three (3) years after its issuance to a public company) that may be reasonably necessary in order for Ono not to withhold tax or to withhold tax at a reduced rate under an applicable bilateral income tax treaty. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall exercise their reasonable efforts to ensure that any withholding taxes imposed are reduced as far as possible under the provisions of any applicable tax treaty, and shall cooperate in filing any forms required for such reduction. Each Party shall cooperate with the other and furnish the other Party with appropriate documents to secure application of the most favorable rate of withholding tax under applicable Law (or exemption from such withholding tax payments, as applicable).\n\n(b) Sales Taxes. Any sales taxes (including any consumption tax or value added tax), use tax, transfer taxes, duties or similar governmental charges required to be paid in connection with the transfer to a Party of a Product (including for clarity, Drug Substance or Drug Product) produced by or on behalf of the supplying Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be the sole responsibility of the receiving Party.

Ono shall keep, and require its Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep, complete, true and accurate books of accounts and records for the purpose of determining the amounts payable to Array pursuant to this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. Such records will be open for inspection during such three (3) year period by an independent certified public accounting firm of nationally (the US or Japan) recognized standing (the \"Auditor\"), chosen by Array and reasonably acceptable to Ono for the purpose of verifying the amounts payable by Ono hereunder. Such inspections may be made no more than once each Calendar Year, at reasonable times and on reasonable prior written notice. Such records for any particular calendar quarter shall be subject to no more than one inspection. The Auditor shall be obligated to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement prior to commencing any such inspection. Inspections conducted under this Section 7.4 shall be at the expense of Array, unless a variation or error producing an underpayment in amounts payable exceeding [ * ] of the amount paid for a period covered by the inspection is established, in which case all reasonable costs relating to the inspection for such period and any unpaid amounts that are discovered shall be paid by Ono, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the rate set forth in Section 7.1 above. The Parties will endeavor in such inspection to minimize disruption of Ono's normal business activities to the extent reasonably practicable. For clarity, while Ono does not engage in the bundling of products as of the Effective Date, in the event that Ono elects in the future to provide a discount for the purchase of a bundle of products that includes a Product, or if its Affiliates or Sublicensees sell Product as part of said discounted bundle, such discount shall be allocated to Product, for purposes of this Agreement, based on the ratio, calculated on a quarterly basis, of Product sales to sales of all of Ono's products sold in the Ono Territory. It is understood that the foregoing audit rights shall include the right to have the Auditor verify Ono's compliance (and the compliance of its Affiliates and Sublicensees) with the above requirements.\n\nARTICLE VIII   CERTAIN COVENANTS\n\n8.1 Diligence Obligations.\n\n(a)  General Diligence Obligations.

For clarity, the forgoing supply obligations not apply to materials that are generally commercially available.\n\n9.3 Clinical Supply. The Parties shall establish as soon as practicable following the Effective Date procedures for the supply of Materials to Ono for use in performing Ono's Development activities under Development Plan and any Joint Development Plans that may subsequently be agreed to by the Parties, and the Parties shall enter into a clinical supply agreement and quality agreement within three (3) months of the Effective Date pursuant to which:\n\n(a) Array shall procure Materials on behalf of and as reasonably requested in writing by Ono, which Materials will be supplied to Ono at transfer price equal to: (i) Array's manufacturing cost to the extent that Array or its Affiliate(s) Manufacture such Materials itself, or (ii) the purchase price paid by Array for such Materials to the extent that Array elects to have such Materials Manufactured by a Subcontractor. The clinical supply agreement shall contain forecasting and ordering procedures (including lead times), product specifications, delivery terms and other customary terms, which terms shall in all cases be consistent with Array's contractual arrangements with its Subcontractors;\n\n(b) Array may place orders for Materials with its Subcontractors on Ono's behalf, or, subject to Ono and the Subcontractors entering into an agreement or other arrangement therefor, Array shall arrange with such Subcontractors for Ono to place such orders, for shipment to Ono and for Ono to pay for such Materials directly to the particular supplier. Array shall not require Ono to place orders directly with a Subcontractor if such Subcontractor is unwilling to fulfill such orders on terms as favorable to Ono as the terms such Subcontractors have extended to Array.\n\n(c)  Array shall use Diligent Efforts to secure for Ono the inspection rights from Array's Subcontractors for Materials. In the event Array is unable to secure such inspection rights from any of its Subcontractors, Array agrees to secure such rights for itself and, if requested by Ono, Array\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nshall exercise such rights, at Ono's expense, on behalf of Ono and fully report the results thereof to Ono.\n\n9.4 Commercial Supply.\n\n(a)  Ono shall have the right (but not the obligation) to Manufacture and/or package, or engage a Subcontractor to Manufacture, Ono's requirements of particular Materials (e.g., Ono's requirements of Drug Substance or Ono's requirements of Drug Product of a particular Product) related to any Product for the Ono Territory. Promptly following Ono's request, Array shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Ono or such Subcontractor all Array's Know-How that is necessary, useful or actually used for such Manufacture, packaging and/ or testing and release of Materials (and the cost of such transfer of Array Know-How shall be borne by Ono), and shall make personnel of Array reasonably available to assist Ono and/or its contractor in implementing the Array Know-How necessary to Manufacture and/or control and release such Materials. Upon completion of the technology transfer enabling Ono to Manufacture the Materials for the Ono Territory under the Marketing Approval, Array's supply obligations under Sections 9.2 and 9.3(b) with respect to such Materials shall terminate and Ono shall assume all supply-related liability with respect to such Materials which it Manufactures or sources from Subcontractor.\n\n(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Ono shall have the right to obtain from Array Ono's commercial requirements of Materials for the Ono Territory. Upon Ono's request, the Parties shall enter into a commercial supply agreement (a \"Supply Agreement\") and commercial quality agreement (a \"Quality Agreement\") on commercially reasonable terms documenting the arrangement pursuant to which:\n\n(i) Array shall supply Ono's reasonable requirements for Materials for the Ono Territory, which Supply Agreement shall contain forecasting and ordering procedures (including lead times), product specifications, delivery terms and other appropriate provisions mutually acceptable, and any customary terms, which terms shall in all cases be consistent with Array's contractual arrangements with its Subcontractors, and taking into account the regulatory requirements imposed on Ono as the holder of the Marketing Approval.\n\n(ii) Array has made arrangements with Novartis to transfer and validate at no cost to Ono all technology reasonably necessary for the manufacturing and analytical testing of the Materials by [ * ] so that commercial quantities of Materials and can be supplied to Ono and released for the Ono Territory;\n\n(iii) Materials supplied by Array to Ono for commercial sale of the Products shall be charged to Ono in an amount equal to (A) [ * ] of Array's manufacturing cost to the extent that Array or its\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nAffiliate(s) Manufacture such Materials itself, or (ii) [ * ] of the purchase price paid by Array for such Materials to the extent that Array elects to have such Materials Manufactured by a Subcontractor.\n\n9.5 Limitation; Manufacturing by Ono.

Array agrees to keep Ono generally informed as to the\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\ncourse of such patent filing, prosecution, maintenance or other proceedings with respect to Array Patents. Array shall provide Ono with copies of each draft patent application with respect to Array Patents (in English, unless Japanese translation is available) to be filed as well as copies of each office action received from the relevant patent offices in each country of the Ono Territory, in each case with enough lead time where reasonably practicable, to enable Ono to review and comment on such application or action; provided that Array shall have no obligation to delay any action or response pending receipt of such comments or suggestions. Additionally, Array will provide Ono with copies of the patent applications and responses to office actions it ultimately files with the patent offices in the Ono Territory (in the original language, unless English translation is available). If Array determines not to file within any jurisdiction requested by Ono, not to continue the prosecution of, or not to continue to maintain or defend, any Array Patent in any country in the Ono Territory, or if Array otherwise determines to abandon any such Array Patent, Array shall promptly notify Ono of such determination sufficiently in advance to enable Ono to undertake or continue the prosecution, maintenance or defense of such Array Patent without a loss of rights, and Ono shall have the right to undertake or continue such prosecution, maintenance or defense at its sole cost and expense. Ono shall hold all information disclosed to it under this Section 11.2 as confidential.\n\n(b)  Prosecution of Joint Patents. Prior to preparation and filing of any Joint Patent, the Parties shall consult with one another and mutually agree upon a lead Party to file, prosecute and maintain such Joint Patent under the names of both Array and Ono. The Joint Patents shall be prepared and prosecuted by a mutually acceptable patent law firm and allocation of costs for preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance shall be agreed by the Parties prior to preparation and filing of such Joint Patent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may elect not to support the filing, prosecution and maintenance of all or part of any Joint Patent in any country in the world.\n\n(c) Patent Term Extensions. Array shall have the right, in consultation with Ono with respect to Array Patents, and Ono shall have the right, with respect to any Patents owned or Controlled by Ono, its Affiliates or Sublicensees related to the Product, to file all applications and take actions necessary to obtain patent term extensions, or similar additional or supplemental protection, with respect to the Product under statutes in any other country within the Ono Territory, which extensions shall be owned by the Party that owns or Controls the underlying Patent. If such Party declines to pursue such patent term extensions, then the other Party shall have the right on behalf of such Party to file all such applications and take all such actions necessary to obtain such patent term extensions (or similar additional or supplemental protection) with respect to the Product. In each case, the Parties shall fully cooperate to obtain such extensions and additional protection.\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n11.3 Enforcement.\n\n(a)  Enforcement Actions.\n\n(i) In the event that Array or Ono becomes aware of actual or threatened infringement or misappropriation of any Array Patent or Array Know-How in any country within the Ono Territory by the Manufacture or sale or use of an unauthorized version of a Product (\"Infringing Product\"), then such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing and the Parties shall consult with each other with respect to the strategy in response to such Infringing Product. Array shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to initiate proceedings or take other appropriate action in Ono Territory, at its own expense, against any such Third Party. If Array does not initiate proceedings or take other appropriate action within ninety (90) days of receipt of a request by Ono to initiate an enforcement proceeding, or if a legal proceeding must be commenced prior to the end of such ninety(90) day period to avoid a loss of rights, then no later than five (5) days prior to such deadline, then Ono shall be entitled to initiate infringement proceedings or take other appropriate action against an Infringing Product at its own expense. The Party conducting such action (\"Enforcing Party\") shall have full control over its conduct, including settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Enforcing Party may not settle any such action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such action, in a manner that would materially adversely affect the rights or interests of the other Party, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, the Parties shall assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at Enforcing Party's reasonable request.\n\n(ii) With respect to Infringing Products containing Binimetinib, Ono's rights under Section 11.3(a)(i) are subject to the rights previously granted to AstraZeneca AB (\"AZ\") pursuant to Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.3 of that certain Collaboration and License Agreement between Array and AZ, effective as of December 18, 2003, as amended by that certain Amendment to Collaboration and License Agreement, between Array and AZ, effective as of June 1, 2009 (collectively, the \"AZ Agreement\"). For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted to or retained by Array pursuant to Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.3 of the AZ Agreement shall, to the extent relating to Infringing Products containing Binimetinib, be subject to this Agreement, including this Section 11.3. Any enforcement actions initiated by AZ with respect to an Infringing Product shall be deemed initiated by Array for purposes of Section 11.3(a)(i), and the costs and expenses incurred by Array in such enforcement action shall include any costs and expenses reimbursed or required to be reimbursed by Array to AZ in accordance with the AZ Agreement in such enforcement action. Additionally it is further understood that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the AZ Agreement, and the rights granted to AZ thereunder, shall in no event constitute a breach of Sections 8.2 and 15.1.\n\n(iii) With respect to the responsibility and allocation of costs for the enforcement of the Joint Patents (i) against Third Party products that infringe the Joint Patents outside the Ono Territory, or (ii)\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nagainst Third Party products in the Ono Territory that infringe the Joint Patents but that are not \"Infringing Products\", the Parties shall discuss and agree at the time when the Parties consult with respect to the strategy of such enforcement action in response to such Third Party infringement.\n\n(b) Recovery.\n\n(i)  Array and Ono shall recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees), or equitable proportions thereof, associated with any litigation against infringers undertaken pursuant to Section 11.3(a) (i) or (ii) above or settlement thereof from any resulting recovery made by either Party. Any excess amount of such a recovery shall be allocated as follows: (i) if Ono initiated such litigation, [ * ] of such excess amount shall be retained by Ono and [ * ] by Array, and (ii) if Array initiated such litigation, Array shall retain [ * ] of such excess amount and Ono shall obtain [ * ] of such excess amount, to the extent such excess amount represents damages relating to Manufacture or sale or use of an Infringing Product in the Ono Territory.\n\n(ii) With respect to enforcement actions against infringers relating to Joint Patents undertaken pursuant to 11.3(a)(iii) above, the Parties shall discuss and agree in good faith at the time when the Parties consult with respect to the strategy of such enforcement action in response to such Third Party infringement.\n\n(c)  Cooperation. The Parties shall keep one another informed of the status of their respective activities regarding any litigation or settlement thereof concerning the Array Patents or the Array Know-How within the Ono Territory, and shall assist one another and cooperate in any such litigation at the other's reasonable request (including joining as a party plaintiff to the extent necessary and requested by the other Party).\n\n11.4 Third Party Infringement Claims.\n\n(a) If the production, sale or use of any Product in the Ono Territory pursuant to this Agreement results in a claim, suit or proceeding alleging patent infringement against Array and/or Ono (or their respective Affiliates, licensees or Sublicensees) (collectively, \"Infringement Actions\"), the Party subject to such claim, suit or proceeding (\"Subject Party\") shall promptly notify the other Party hereto in writing and shall discuss with the other Party the strategy for defending such Infringement Actions but shall have the right to direct and control the defense thereof in its sole discretion and at its own expense, with counsel of its choice; provided, however, the other Party may participate in the defense and/or settlement thereof, at its own expense with counsel of its choice. In any event, the Subject Party agrees to keep the other Party hereto reasonably informed of all material developments in connection with any such Infringement Action. Ono agrees not to settle such Infringement Action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such Infringement Action, in a manner that would adversely affect the allegedly infringing Product\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nor the Manufacture, use or sale of such Product in any country of the world, without the prior written consent of Array; and Array agrees not to settle such Infringement Action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such Infringement Action, in a manner that would adversely affect the allegedly infringing Product, or the Manufacture, use or sale of such Product, within the Ono Territory, without the prior written consent of Ono, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n\nARTICLE XII   TRADEMARKS\n\n12.1 Display.\n\n(a)  All packaging materials, labels and Marketing Materials for the Products shall display the Product Trademarks in katakana or in other applicable language and no other product-specific trademarks or branding.\n\n(i) Products Containing Binimetinib. Where possible, Ono shall utilize \"mektovi\" as the Product Trademark for Products containing Binimetinib. If the use of \"mektovi\" is not advisable for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono shall utilize \"balimek\" as such Product Trademark is such country or countries. If neither \"mektovi\" not \"balimek\" can be used (or if it is not advisable to use them) for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono may select an alternative Product Trademark reasonably acceptable to Array for use in such country or countries, with any disputes being referred to the JCC for resolution, it being understood that in resolving any such dispute the JCC shall give preference to the creation of a single brand for Products containing Binimetinib in countries where neither \"balimek\" or \"mektovi\" can be used.\n\n(ii) Products Containing Encorafenib. Where possible, Ono shall utilize \"braftovi\" as the Product Trademark for Products containing Encorafenib. If the use of \"braftovi\" is not advisable for legal, regulatory or other material reasons outside the Parties' reasonable control, in one or more countries of the Ono Territory, Ono may select an alternative Product Trademark reasonably acceptable to Array for use in such country or countries, with any disputes being referred to the JCC for resolution, it being understood that in resolving any such dispute the JCC shall give preference to the creation of a single brand for Products containing Encorafenib in countries where \"braftovi\" cannot be used.\n\n(b) Each Product shall be sold in the Ono Territory under the trade name Ono or other trade name chosen by Ono and the logo of Ono; provided, however that to the extent permissible under applicable Law within the Ono Territory, such packaging materials, labels and Marketing Materials shall also display the trade name of Array in reasonable size and prominence,\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nas reasonably approved by Array. The trademarks of Ono, trade dress, style of packaging and the like with respect to the Product in the Ono Territory may be determined by Ono in a manner that is consistent with Ono's standard trade dress and style, but shall be subject to the approval by the JCC to ensure the same are consistent with Array's global trademark guidelines.\n\n12.2 Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, following registration of the Product Trademark(s) by Array in the Ono Territory pursuant to Section 12.3 below, Array shall assign, and shall cause its Affiliates to assign, to Ono all rights to the Product Trademark(s) so registered in the Ono Territory at Ono's cost and expense, in each case solely for the purpose of Commercializing the Products in the Ono Territory in accordance with this Agreement. Ono shall be responsible for maintenance of such Product Trademark(s) at its cost and expense in the Ono Territory.\n\n12.3 Registration of Trademarks and Trade Dress.\n\n(a)  Products Containing Binimetinib. If the Product Trademark for Products containing Binimetinib is balimek or mektovi, Array (or its designee) shall use Diligent Efforts to file and register at Array's expense and in its own name (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), appropriate registrations for such Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory. If, however, neither balimek nor mektovi is available or desirable in a given country or countries, Ono agrees to file and register, at Ono's expense and name, appropriate registrations for an alternative Product Trademark (selected in accordance with Section 12.1(a)(i)) in such country or countries of the Ono Territory. As between the Parties, Ono shall have the sole right to file at its expense and in its own name, appropriate registrations for the trade dress utilized with the Product in the Ono Territory.\n\n(b) Products Containing Encorafenib. If the Product Trademark for Products containing Encorafenib is braftovi, Array (or its designee) shall use Diligent Efforts to file and register at Array's expense and in its own name (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), appropriate registrations for such Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory. If, however, braftovi is not available or desirable in a given country or countries, Ono agrees to file and register, at Ono's expense and name, appropriate registrations for an alternative Product Trademark (selected in accordance with Section 12.1(a)(ii)) in such country or countries of the Ono Territory. As between the Parties, Ono shall have the sole right to file at its expense and in its own name, appropriate registrations for the trade dress utilized with the Product in the Ono Territory.\n\n12.4 Approval of Packaging and Promotional Materials. The Parties agree that the quality of the Products packaging shall be consistent with the highest standards of quality in the pharmaceuticals industry.\n\n(a)  Mektovi/Balimek/Array. Without limiting Section 5.1(c) above, to the extent necessary to preserve Array's legal rights in the balimek or mektovi Product Trademarks,\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nOno shall submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying the balimek or mektovi Product Trademarks and/or Array's trade name to Array for Array's review and approval (such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to the first use of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product and prior to any subsequent change or addition to such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product; provided that if Array has not responded within ten (10) Business Days after the submission of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product, Array's approval will be deemed to have been received.\n\n(b) Braftovi/Array. Without limiting Section 5.1(c) above, to the extent necessary to preserve Array's legal rights in the braftovi Product Trademark, Ono shall submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying the braftovi Product Trademark and/or Array's trade name to Array for Array's review and approval (such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to the first use of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product and prior to any subsequent change or addition to such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product; provided that if Array has not responded within ten (10) Business Days after the submission of such Marketing Materials, packaging or Product, Array's approval will be deemed to have been received.\n\n(c)  Other. With respect to all Product Trademarks other than balimek, mektovi or braftovi, Ono shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and Sublicensees to, comply with trademark style and usage standards approved by Array from time to time in connection with use of the Product Trademark(s). Ono shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, at its own expense, submit representative Marketing Materials, packaging and Product displaying such Product Trademarks to Array for approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that Array reasonably objects to a proposed usage of the Product Trademark(s), it shall give written notice of such objection to Ono within sixty (60) days of receipt of such sample, specifying the way in which such usage of its Product Trademark(s) fails to meet the style, usage or quality standards for the Product or Product Trademark set forth in the first two sentences of this Section 12.4(c). If Ono or its Affiliate wishes to use such representative Marketing Materials, it must remedy the failure and submit further samples to Array's for approval.\n\n12.5 Enforcement.\n\n(a)  If either Party becomes aware of any actual or threatened infringement of any Product Trademark in the Ono Territory, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing. Ono shall, at its own expense, initiate infringement proceedings or take other appropriate actions against an infringement of any Product Trademark in the Ono Territory and/or to defend any actions or proceedings involving the Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory, as the case may be. Ono shall have full control over the conduct of such action, including settlement thereof;\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nprovided, however, Ono may not settle any such action, or make any admissions or assert any position in such action, in a manner that would materially adversely affect the Product Trademarks in the Ono Territory nor the rights or interests of Array, without the prior written consent of Array, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In any event, the Ono shall keep Array informed of the status of its activities regarding any litigation in the Ono Territory involving a Product Trademark or settlement thereof and Array shall assist Ono and cooperate in any such litigation at Ono's reasonable request and expense.\n\n(b) Ono and Array shall recover their respective actual out-of-pocket expenses, or proportionate percentages thereof, associated with any litigation against infringers undertaken pursuant to this Section 12.5 or settlement thereof from any resulting recovery made by either Party. Any excess amount of such a recovery shall be [ * ] between Ono and Array, to the extent such recovery represents damages pertaining to the infringement of a Product Trademark in the Ono Territory.\n\n12.6 Domain Names. Array shall own rights to, and shall be responsible, at its own expense, for registering and maintaining, the Internet domain names listed on Exhibit 12.6 (each of the foregoing, a \"Domain Name\") and agrees to grant, and hereby grants to Ono a royalty-free, fully paid-up exclusive license to use those particular Domain Names which Ono elects to use (and actually uses) in connection with Ono's commercialization of the Product in the Ono Territory in accordance with this Agreement. In the event Ono would like to use an available Internet domain name including the balimek, mektovi or braftovi, or Product Trademarks not previously registered to Array, Array grants Ono its consent to register and maintain such Internet domain names in Ono's name and at Ono's expense, provided that upon termination (but not expiration) of this Agreement, Ono shall transfer full and exclusive ownership and control of such Internet domain names to Array, or if Array so requests, promptly withdraw registration of such Internet domain name(s), in each case at Ono's sole cost and expense. Each Party shall own rights to any Internet domain names incorporating the Product Trademark(s) owned by such Party under Section 12.1 or any variation or part of such Product Trademark(s) as its URL address or any part of such address, and agrees to grant, and hereby grants to the other Party a royalty-free, fully paid-up exclusive license to use those particular Internet domain names which the grantee Party elects to use (and actually uses) in connection with the grantee Party's commercialization of the applicable Product in the grantee Party's Territory in accordance with this Agreement. The use rights granted to the Internet domain names under this Section 12.6 are limited to the grantee Party's Territory, and neither Party shall actively make or authorize any use, direct or otherwise, of its Internet domain names outside its respective territory. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Internet domain names and the goodwill pertaining to such Internet domain names shall belong exclusively to the Party owning such Internet domain name, who shall be registered as \"Registrant\" or \"Owner\" and as \"Administrative Contact\" of the relevant domain name. The Parties agree that any use of a Product Trademark in any content describing or referring to a Product: (i) on any internet page or web site operated by Array in\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nthe Array Territory shall be in the sole control of Array, and (ii) on any internet page or web site operated by Ono in the Ono Territory, subject to the terms of this Agreement, shall be in the sole control of Ono, and therefore Ono and Array, respectively, shall be responsible for any damage caused to the Product Trademarks as a result of their use of the Product Trademarks on any internet page or web site in their respective territories.\n\nARTICLE XIII\n\nTERM AND TERMINATION\n\n13.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to this Article 13, shall continue in full force and effect, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis until the Secondary Royalty Term with respect to such Product expires, at which time this Agreement shall expire in its entirety with respect to such Product in such country. Upon expiration of this Agreement, the licenses granted to Ono under Section 2.1 shall become non-exclusive, fully paid- up, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free licenses, with sublicensing rights, to Develop, Manufacture, and/or Commercialize the Products in the Ono Territory. From and after the expiration of this Agreement, Ono shall have the exclusive, fully paid up, royalty- free right to use (i) Product Trademarks assigned to Ono under Section 12.2, and (ii) those Domain Names licensed to Ono under Section 12.6, in each case solely for purposes of, and to the extent necessary, for Ono to continue to Commercialize the Products in the Field in the Ono Territory.\n\n13.2 Termination by Ono without Cause. Commencing on the later of (i) [ * ] of the First Commercial Sale of the Binimetinib Product in the Ono Territory, or (ii) [ * ] of the First Commercial Sale of the Encorafenib Product in the Ono Territory, Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, for any reasons by giving [ * ] advance written notice to Array which shall be accompanied by the rationale for such termination.\n\n13.3 Termination for Material Breach. Either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety in the event the other Party shall have materially breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its material obligations hereunder, and such default shall have continued for ninety (90) days (or with respect to any breach of any payment obligations, for sixty (60) days) after written notice thereof was provided to the breaching Party by the non\u2011breaching Party. Any such termination shall become effective at the end of such ninety (90) day period (or sixty (60) day period with respect to any failure to pay) unless the breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period. Exercising the right to terminate this Agreement by a Party pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall not preclude a claim or a compensation for damages on the other Party.\n\n13.4 Termination for Bankruptcy. Either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party: (a) if such other Party is declared insolvent or bankrupt by a\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\ncourt of competent jurisdiction; (b) if a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy is filed in any court of competent jurisdiction against such other Party and such petition is not dismissed within ninety (90) days after filing; (c) if such other Party shall make or execute an assignment of substantially all of its assets for the benefit of creditors; or (d) substantially all of the assets of such other Party are seized or attached and not released within ninety (90) days thereafter.\n\n13.5 Termination for Safety Reasons and Efficacy Reason.\n\n(a)  Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, on a Product-by-Product basis, for Safety Reasons upon thirty (30) days written notice to Array or within a shorter period if required under applicable Law, but only after consulting with Array and obtaining Array's agreement with Ono's assessment with respect to such Safety Reasons (or as provided for below, the agreement of the Experts). Ono shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for Efficacy Reasons upon one hundred and eighty (180) days written notice to Array.\n\n(b) If Array disagrees with Ono's assessment with respect to Safety Reasons, such matter shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 17.2, which shall apply mutatis mutandis, which Experts shall determine whether the Safety Reasons are justified and are unlikely to be reversed, within a reasonable period of time with a commercially reasonable level of investment. The opinion of the majority of the Experts shall be finally binding on the Parties.\n\n(c)  \"Safety Reasons\" shall mean that, based upon all relevant scientific data, there are safety and public health issues relating to the Product such that the medical benefit/risk ratio of such Product is sufficiently unfavorable as to materially compromise the welfare of patients so that the use in patients is no longer justifiable and that such issues are unlikely to be reversed within a reasonable period of time with a commercially reasonable level of investment.\n\n(d) \"Efficacy Reasons\" shall mean that either (i) there is no efficacy or lower efficacy of the Products in comparison with control arm in COLUMBUS Clinical Study as well as BEACON Clinical Study (neither triplet therapy nor doublet therapy demonstrates statistically significant efficacy in comparison with control arm), or (ii) as of the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, neither BRAF-mutant Melanoma and Marketing Approval nor BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer have received Marketing Approval from MHLW.\n\nARTICLE XIV   EFFECT OF TERMINATION\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n14.1 Accrued Obligations. The expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not release either Party from any liability which, at the time of such expiration or termination, has already accrued to the other Party or which is attributable to a period prior to such expiration or termination, nor will any termination of this Agreement preclude either Party from pursuing all rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement, or at law or in equity, with respect to breach of this Agreement.\n\n14.2 Rights on Termination of Agreement. In case of termination of this Agreement by either Party, this Section 14.2 shall apply:\n\n(a)  Wind-down.\n\n(i) Development. In the event Ono is the sponsor of or conducting any on-going Clinical Studies of the Product following the date a notice of termination has been issued by Array or Ono, to the extent requested by Array, Ono agrees to: (A) continue to sponsor or conduct any such Clinical Studies in normal course if such Clinical Studies can be completed (i) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, or (ii) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of any other termination of this Agreement by either Party, or (B) promptly transition to Array or its designee such sponsorship or Clinical Studies (or portions thereof) provided that in such case, Array shall take over such studies (i) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of a termination by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, or (ii) within [ * ] following the effective date of termination in the case of any other termination of this Agreement by either Party. In addition, in the event Ono is conducting any on-going pre-clinical studies and/or formulation studies (e.g., stability studies) of the Product, Ono agrees to promptly transition to Array or its designee such pre-clinical studies and/or formulation studies to the extent such transfer is reasonably possible. In the case of a termination by Array pursuant to Section 8.2, 13.3 or 13.4 or by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2, Ono shall be responsible for (1) costs of carrying out the transfers described in this Section 14.2(a)(i), and (2) all costs of on-going Clinical Studies through the termination of the wind-down period (including for clarity, the costs incurred by Array in carrying out any transferred Clinical Studies through the termination of the wind-down period). In all other cases Array shall be responsible for such costs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Ono terminates this Agreement with respect to a Product pursuant to Section 13.5(a), Ono shall not be obligated to continue to sponsor or conduct any Clinical Studies with respect to such Product under Section 14.2(a)(i)(A) above.\n\n(ii) Commercialization. To avoid disruption in the availability of Product to patients, if this Agreement is terminated after the First Commercial Sale of the Product in the Ono Territory other than pursuant to Section 13.5, then to the extent requested by Array, Ono, its Affiliates and its Sublicensees shall continue to distribute (but shall not be obligated to market or promote) the Product, in accordance\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nwith the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in each country of the Ono Territory for which Marketing Approval therefor has been obtained, taking into account applicable issues, if any, for patient safety or the requirements of a Regulatory Authority within the Ono Territory, until the date on which Array notifies Ono in writing that Array has secured an alternative distributor or licensee for the Product in such country, but in no event more for than (A) [ * ] after the date of such notice of termination of this Agreement by Ono pursuant to Section 13.2 or by Array pursuant to Section 13.4 or (B) [ * ] after the date of such notice of termination of this Agreement by Array pursuant to Sections 8.2 or 13.3 or by Ono pursuant to Section 13.3 or 13.4 (\"Wind- down Period\"); provided that Ono, its Affiliates and its Sublicensees shall cease such activities, or any portion thereof, in a given country upon sixty (60) days' notice by Array requesting that such activities (or portion thereof) be ceased.

Once the Experts have been selected, each Party shall, in accordance with mutually agreed timelines and procedures, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days from the selection of the Experts, provide the Experts and the other Party with a written report setting forth its position with respect to the substance of the Expert Dispute and may submit a revised or updated report and position to the Experts as mutually agreed or as determined by the Experts. If so requested by the Experts, each Party shall make oral submissions to the Experts based on such Party's written report delivered pursuant to this Section 17.2(c), and each Party shall have the right to be present during any such oral submissions.\n\n(d) Determination by the Experts. The Experts shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the last submission of the written reports and, if any, oral submissions, select one of the Parties' positions as their final decision, and shall not have the authority to modify either Party's position or render any substantive decision other than to so select the position of either Ono or Array as set forth in their respective written report (as initially submitted, or as revised in accordance with Section 17.2(c), as applicable). The Parties agree that the decision of the Experts shall be the sole, exclusive and binding remedy between them regarding any Expert Dispute presented to the Experts, provided that the Experts' decision with respect to disputes referred to it pursuant to Section 3.5 shall become the decision of the JDRC on the matter for all purposes of this Agreement. The proceedings and the decision of the Experts shall not be made public without the joint consent of the Parties and each Party shall maintain the confidentiality of such proceedings and decision unless each Party otherwise agrees in writing; provided that either Party may make such disclosures as are permitted for Confidential Information of the other Party under Article 10 above.\n\n(e)  Timetable for Completion in Thirty (30) business days. The Parties shall use, and shall direct the Experts to use, diligent efforts to resolve any Expert Dispute within thirty (30) Business Days after the selection of the Experts, or if resolution within thirty (30) Business Days is not reasonably achievable, as determined by the Experts, then as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, provided that the Experts shall resolve the Expert Dispute no later than ninety (90) Business Days after the selection of the Experts.\n\n17.3 Arbitration. Except with respect to (i) those matters subject to determination by the Experts as provided in Section 17.2, or (ii) any dispute between the Parties concerning the inventorship of intellectual property rights for which either Party may pursue such remedies as it may deem necessary\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nor appropriate, any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (each, a \"Dispute\") shall be exclusively resolved by final and binding arbitration as follows:\n\n(a)  Arbitration under the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators according to the ICC Rules of Arbitration (\"Rules\"), and the panel of three arbitrators so selected is referred to herein as the \"Arbitration Tribunal.\" The seat of the arbitration shall be in Osaka, Japan, if it is demanded by Array, and in New York, NY, USA, if it is demanded by Ono, with hearings to held in the same location. The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions shall not apply.\n\n(b) Conduct of the proceedings. The language of arbitration shall be English. If so requested by the Arbitration Tribunal, any documents originally in a language other than English shall be submitted with an English translation. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the authority to order document production taking guidance from the applicable rules under the laws of the seat of the arbitration. If the tribunal orders production of documents, the tribunal shall take guidance from the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration as current on the dated the commencement of the arbitration. The Parties wish to avoid a costly and time-consuming discovery exercise. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the power to appoint one or more experts after having consulted with the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law set forth in Section 18.3 shall not apply to determine any procedural issues. In particular, but without in any way restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties agree that the procedural rules of the governing law set forth in Section 18.3 shall not apply with respect to document production or other evidentiary issues, except that all privileges restricting disclosure established under such governing law shall apply and may be invoked by both Parties\n\n(c)  Time limit for rendering the award. The Parties and the Arbitration Tribunal shall endeavor to complete any arbitration within twelve (12) months following the full constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal. However, this period is not a deadline and failure to render an award within them shall not be a ground for annulment of an award.\n\n(d) Decision of the Arbitration Tribunal. Every award shall be binding on the Parties. By submitting the dispute to arbitration under the Rules, the Parties undertake to carry out any award without delay and shall be deemed to have waived their right to any form of recourse insofar as such waiver can validly be made. The Parties agree that they can seek recognition and enforcement of any order and/or award made by the Arbitration Tribunal before any competent court. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive damages or other damages exceeding the damages actually suffered by the prevailing Party, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the provisions of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal (the translation fee described Section 17.3 (b) shall be\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ * ] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nincluded) shall be shared equally by the Parties, and each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding, in each case unless the Arbitration Tribunal in the award assesses such fees and/or expenses against one of the Parties or allocates such fees and expenses other than equally between the Parties.\n\n(e)  Confidentiality. The existence and content of the Arbitration proceedings and any rulings or award shall be deemed Confidential Information of both Parties hereunder and kept confidential by the Parties and members of the Arbitration Tribunal except (i) where such disclosure is permitted under Article 10 of this Agreement, (ii) to the extent that disclosure may be required of a Party to fulfil a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings before a state court or other judicial authority, (iii) with the consent of all Parties made in writing subsequently to this Agreement, (iii) where needed for the preparation or presentation of a claim or defense in this arbitration, (iv) where such information is already in the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this clause, or (v) by order of the Arbitration Tribunal upon application of a Party.\n\n(f)  Non-Disclosure of Communications with Internal Counsel. Notwithstanding any rights to the contrary under applicable procedural or substantive rules of Law, any communications exchanged between members of each Party's respective legal department and directors, employees or agents in connection with any disputes, investigations, administrative or other proceedings, shall not be requested, produced or otherwise used, to the extent such communications would have been covered by legal privilege and not disclosable, had these communications been exchanged between such Party and its external attorneys.\n\n(g) Interim Relief. The Arbitration Tribunal shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that it deems appropriate, whether provisional or final, including but not limited to conservatory relief and injunctive relief, and any such measures ordered by the Arbitration Tribunal shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the governing law selected by the Parties pursuant to Section 18.3, be deemed to be a final award on the subject matter of the measures and shall be enforceable as such. Each Party retains the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional and/or conservatory relief, including injunctions or temporary restraining orders before or after the constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the Agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate.\n\nARTICLE XVIII\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n18.1 Force Majeure.

The request shall indicate the grounds on which it is based. The Parties shall then consult one another with a view to revising the contract an equitable basis, in order to ensure that neither Party suffers excessive prejudice.

If the Parties fail to agree on the revision of the contract within time limit of ninety (90) business days of the request, the contract remains in force in accordance with its original terms.\n\n18.3 Governing Law. This Agreement and all questions regarding its validity or interpretation, or the breach or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, United States, without reference to conflict of law principles.

The failure of either Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by either Party of any condition or term in any one or more instances shall be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such condition or term or of another condition or term.\n\n18.5 Modification. No amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing signed by both Parties hereto. No provision of this Agreement shall be varied, contradicted or explained by any oral agreement, course of dealing or performance or any other matter not set forth in an agreement in writing and signed by both Parties hereto.\n\n18.6 Severability.

All indemnification claims in respect of any Sanofi Indemnitee or RevMed Indemnitee seeking indemnity under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\" and each an \"Indemnitee\") will be made solely by the corresponding Party (the \"Indemnified Party\"). The Indemnified Party will give the indemnifying Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") prompt written notice (an \"Indemnification Claim Notice\") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2, but failure to provide prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder except to the extent any Losses result from such delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). Together with the Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by any Indemnitee in connection with the Third Party Claim.\n\n(b) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification as provided for in Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may select and appoint the lead legal counsel for the defense of the Third Party Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party or any other Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party or other Indemnitee in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim. 72\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 14.3(b), any Indemnitee will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment will be at the Indemnitee's own expense unless (a) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (b) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 14.3(b) (in which case the Indemnified Party will control the defense).\n\n(d) Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not result in the Indemnitee's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnitee in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. The Indemnifying Party will pay all amounts on behalf of the Indemnified Party at or prior to the time of the entry of judgment. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b), the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will be at the Indemnified Party's sole and absolute discretion). The Indemnifying Party that has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b) will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnitee that is reached without the written consent of such Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee will admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without first offering to the Indemnifying Party the opportunity to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b).\n\n(e) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, and will cause each other Indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnitees and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with such cooperation.\n\n(f) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim will be reimbursed on a [***] by the Indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the Indemnifying Party's right to contest the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party. 73\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4 Mitigation of Loss. Each Indemnified Party shall take and shall procure that its Affiliates take all such reasonable steps and action as are reasonably necessary or as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require in order to mitigate any Third Party Claims (or potential losses or damages) under this Article XIV. Nothing in this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to relieve any Party of any common law or other duty to mitigate any losses incurred by it.\n\n14.5 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 14.5 IS INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTY UNDER SECTION 14.1 OR SECTION 14.2, OR DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO CONFIDENTIALITY UNDER ARTICLE XI OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER ARTICLE X.\n\n14.6 Insurance. Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance, including product liability insurance, with respect to its activities hereunder and under the Ancillary Agreements and which is consistent with normal business practices of companies similarly situated at all times during which any SHP2 Inhibitors or Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold. Sanofi may fulfill such obligation through self- insurance. Each Party shall provide the other Party with evidence of such insurance upon request and, in the case of RevMed, shall provide Sanofi with written notice at least [***] prior to the cancellation, non-renewal or material changes in such insurance. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article XIV.\n\nArticle XV.\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n15.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable to the other Party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for failure or delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances (whether involving the workforce of the nonperforming Party or of any other Person), fire, floods, earthquakes or other acts of God, or acts, generally applicable action or inaction by any governmental authority (but excluding any government action or inaction that is specific to such Party, its Affiliates or Sublicensees, such as revocation or non-renewal of such Party's license to conduct business), or omissions or delays in acting by the other Party, or unavailability of materials related to the Manufacture of the Products (each cause, an event of \"Force Majeure\").

The suspension of performance allowed hereunder shall be of no greater scope and no longer duration than is reasonably required, and the affected Party shall promptly undertake and continue diligently all reasonable efforts necessary to cure such force majeure circumstances or to perform its obligations in spite of the ongoing circumstances. In the event that RevMed is the non-performing Party and the Force Majeure continues for more than [***] (which period, in its entirety or a portion thereof, is prior to the commencement of the Registration Program for a Product, which Development thereof is impacted by such Force Majeure), Sanofi's payment obligations under Article IX shall be suspended until notification by RevMed to Sanofi of the termination of such Force Majeure Event (and any related triggers and deadlines shall be similarly suspended).\n\n15.2 Assignment; Change of Control.\n\n(a) Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except as expressly permitted hereunder, or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the consent of the other Party, except as follows:\n\n(i) Sanofi may, without consent of RevMed, assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of Sanofi, and RevMed may, with the consent of Sanofi (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of RevMed; and\n\n(ii) Either Party may, without consent of the other Party, assign this Agreement in whole to (i) in the case of RevMed, its successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in the case of a Change of Control or (ii) in the case of Sanofi, its successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates, or in connection with a merger, acquisition or similar transaction.

Corio or its Customer shall cooperate with Commerce One, at Commerce One's expense, in defending or settling such claim and Corio or its Customer may join in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense. If the Software is, or in the opinion of Commerce One may become, the subject of any claim of infringement or if it is adjudicatively determined that the Software infringes, then Commerce One may, at its sole option and expense, either (i) procure for Corio the right from such third party to use the Software, (ii) replace or modify the Software with other suitable and substantially equivalent products so that the Software becomes noninfringing, or if (i) and (ii) are not practicable after Commerce One has exhausted all diligent efforts, (iii) terminate this\n\n\n\n\n\n     Agreement and refund to Corio a pro-rated portion of the fees paid hereunder.\n\n8.2     Limitations.

If either party materially breaches any term or condition of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within-thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach, the nonbreaching party may terminate this Agreement on written notice at any time following the end of such-thirty (30) day period. This Agreement shall terminate immediately upon notice if either party becomes insolvent (i.e., becomes unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come due) or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Compliance by the Software with the Software's specifications after expiration of the Warranty Period shall be deemed a material condition of this Agreement.\n\n11.3    Effect of Termination. The following Sections shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason: 4.2, 5.3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14.

Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, Commerce One agrees to execute an escrow agreement by and among Corio, Commerce One and a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the \"ESCROW AGENT\"). The Escrow Agent shall require Commerce One to place in an\n\n    10\n\n11 escrow account in California a copy of the source code of the Software\n\n\n\n\n\n     including all Updates and Upgrades thereto, documentation and similar materials (the SOURCE CODE). The escrow agreement shall contain, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 12. Corio shall bear all fees, expenses and other charges to open and maintain such escrow account. If a Release Condition (as defined in Section 12.2 of this Agreement) occurs and the Escrow Agent provides the Source Code to Corio under the escrow agreement, Corio agrees to hold the Source Code in confidence pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 10 of this Agreement, and not to use them for any purpose other than those purposes contemplated under Section 12.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.2    Release. Corio shall notify Commerce One in writing if it believes that one of the following events (the \"RELEASE CONDITIONS\") has occurred and that it intends to seek release of the Source Code from the escrow account: (i) Commerce One's dissolution or ceasing to do business in the normal course, or (ii) Commerce One's repeated and material breach of its support and maintenance obligations under Section 5 of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice thereof from Corio. If Commerce One notifies Corio in writing that it disputes whether any such event has occurred, officers of each of the parties shall negotiate for a period of ten (10) business days to attempt to resolve the dispute. At the end of such ten (10) business day period, if the parties have not resolved the dispute, the matter shall be referred to arbitration in the manner provided in Section 14.3 of this Agreement.\n\n12.3    License. Upon the release of the Source Code to Corio pursuant to Section 12.2 of this Agreement, Corio shall have a royalty-free, nonexclusive, nontransferable, right and license in the Territory to use and modify the Source Code to support and maintain the Software until the expiration or termination of Corio's Customers' End User License Agreements. The object code derived from the Source Code so modified shall be subject to the same rights and restrictions on use, reproduction and disclosure that are contained in this Agreement with respect to the Software. Corio shall not distribute, sell or sublicense the Source Code. Subject to the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Commerce One shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Source Code. This license shall be deemed to extend worldwide in scope if Corio, at the time one or more Release Conditions has occurred, has been granted worldwide license rights by Commerce One under Section 2 of this Agreement.\n\n13      SHARED RESOURCES.\n\n13.1    Operations.

Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to prohibit either parties' right to independently develop the Developments contemplated above. Each party covenants that it shall not, under any circumstances, sue the other party (or its officers, directors, successors and assigns) or any of that parties' licensees, customers, or distributors (\"Protected Entities\") for patent infringment under any future patents or future patent rights relating to said Developments, that either party owns or controls, so long as that Protected Entity has a license from Commerce One or Corio to the Software, or to a product that is a modification of, derivative work based on, or replacement for the Software. The foregoing covenant is binding on Corio's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the benefit of any\n\n    12\n\n13 of Commerce One's successors and assigns, and is binding on Commerce One's permitted successors and assigns, and inures to the benefit of any of Corio's successors and assigns.\n\n14      MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n14.1    Assignment.

Any assignment in violation of this Section 14.1 shall be null and void.\n\n14.2    Waiver and Amendment. No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be charged.

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, excluding conflict of laws provisions and excluding the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules in San Francisco County, California. A judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction of the parties, including without limitation the courts in San Francisco, California. The non-prevailing party in the arbitration shall pay all fees and charges of the American Arbitration Association; each party, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses connected with the presentation of its respective case.\n\n14.4    Notices. All notices, demands or consents required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing.

If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the\n\n    13\n\n14 objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n14.7    Force Majeure. Neither party shall be deemed to be in breach of this agreement for any failure or delay in performance caused by reasons beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, earthquakes, strikes or shortages of materials.\n\n14.8    Subcontract. Commerce One understands and agrees that Corio shall solely direct the provision of Corio Services and may subcontract certain portions of the Corio Services to third parties at any time during the term of the Agreement.\n\n14.9    Bankruptcy. The parties hereto agree that Corio, as a licensee of Commerce One's intellectual property, shall be afforded all of the protections afforded to a licensee under Section 365(n) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended from time to time (the \"CODE\") so that the Trustee or Debtor in Possession, as defined in the Code, will not interfere with Corio's license with respect to the Software as provided in this Agreement, as set forth in Section 365(n) of the Code.\n\n14.10   Complete Understanding.

ROYALTIES AND SERVICE FEES.   9.1 Royalties. DIALOG will pay ENERGOUS the Royalties set forth in  Exhibit B. For clarity, DIALOG will be responsible for paying to ENERGOUS any Royalties payable hereunder as a result of its Affiliates' Licensed Product Sales.   9.2 Service Fee. Subject to Section 4.3, DIALOG will pay ENERGOUS the Service Fees set forth in Exhibit B. For clarity, subject to Section 4.3, DIALOG will be responsible for paying to ENERGOUS any Service Fees payable hereunder for services provided by ENERGOUS hereunder to DIALOG's Affiliates or any of DIALOG's or its Affiliates' customers.   9.3 Payment. Payments of Royalties and Service Fees will be due on a calendar quarterly basis, within [***] days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the applicable Licensed Products were Sold or services were rendered. From the date a payment is due, unless otherwise agreed, any late payment will accrue a late payment fee of [***] per month, or the highest interest rate permitted by law, whichever is less.   9.4 Reports. Each payment made hereunder will be accompanied by a report detailing (a) the total number of units, on a product-by- product basis, of the Licensed Products Sold during the previous calendar quarter, (b) DIALOG's and its Affiliates' Net Sales attributable to such Licensed Product units during such calendar quarter, and (c) reasonable details regarding the calculation of the quarterly Royalty payment and Service Fee. Such information will be maintained in strict confidence by ENERGOUS under Section 10 of this Agreement.   9.5 Books. With respect to its exercise of the rights and licenses granted in, and payment obligations under, this Agreement, DIALOG and its Affiliates will keep accurate books and other records, including but not limited to supporting documentation for the Royalties and Service Fees paid hereunder (the \"Records\"). These Records will be maintained for a period of at least three (3) years from the date of the related payment (\"Record Retention Period\"), notwithstanding any termination of expiration of this Agreement.   9.6 Audit Rights. During the Record Retention Period, ENERGOUS may appoint a mutually agreed independent, internationally recognized third-party certified auditor who will have the right to inspect and copy the Records upon reasonable prior notice, and DIALOG will (and will cause its Affiliates to) allow necessary access including, as applicable, to its premises where such Records are located. ENERGOUS may exercise such right to this independent-third party audit no more than one time per calendar year and each such audit will be conducted during normal business hours. Such audit may also not interfere with DIALOG's or its Affliates' quarterly closing of its books. In the event that such audit reveals an underpayment of Royalties or Service Fees owed by DIALOG, DIALOG will promptly pay ENERGOUS the amount of the underpayment. If such underpayment is in excess of [***] of the Royalties or Service Fee due for the period audited, DIALOG will also reimburse ENERGOUS for its reasonable, out-of-pocket cost of such audit. In the event that such audit reveals an overpayment of Royalties or Service Fees owed by DIALOG, ENERGOUS will promptly pay DIALOG the amount of the overpayment.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  9.7 Taxes. Each party will be responsible to collect, bear and pay any and all taxes levied or based upon the party's sale of the Products, Product Die or Licensed Products, including, all sales, use, value added, withholding or similar taxes. In the event that the government of a country imposes any income taxes on payments made by a party to the other hereunder and requires a party to withhold such tax from such payments, such party may deduct such tax from such payments. Each party will be responsible for its own banking costs relating to the receipt of payments of Royalties and Service Fees and any other monies payable to it in connection with this Agreement.   9.8 Payment Currency.

The term \"Confidential Information\" means all financial, business and technical information disclosed by or on behalf of a party in relation to this Agreement (whether tangible or intangible, and including all copies, analyses and derivatives thereof), that is marked or otherwise identified as proprietary or confidential at the time of disclosure, or which by its nature would be understood by a reasonable person to be proprietary or confidential, including all copies, abstracts, summaries, analyses and derivatives thereof. Confidential Information does not include information the receiving party can demonstrate (a) was rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party without breach of any obligation to the disclosing party, (b) is generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement, (c) was available to or already in the possession or control of the receiving party on a non-confidential basis before receipt from the disclosing party or (d) is independently developed by it or its employees without reliance on such information. Information associated with DIALOG's quarterly Royalty or Service Fee disclosures is Confidential Information of DIALOG.   10.2 Non-Disclosure. The receiving party agrees (a) not to copy or use the disclosing party's Confidential Information except and only for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement, (b) to maintain it as confidential, and exercise reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access, use and disclosure, (c) not to disclose it to any third party other than the receiving party's employees and contractors who have a need to know for the permitted purpose and who are bound by obligations that are at least as protective as the restrictions in this Agreement and (d) not to export or re-export in violation of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations any such Confidential Information or product thereof. Each party will bear the responsibility for any breach of this Section 10 by its and its Affiliates' employees and contractors. Upon any termination of this Agreement or, in the event of any Wind Down Period or Continuing Obligation period, upon the expiration of such period, and within fifteen (15) days after request by the disclosing party, each receiving party will return the Confidential Information of the other or destroy such Confidential Information and all copies of it and all information, records and materials developed therefrom, except that the recipient may retain one copy for archival purposes to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein will require the erasure, deletion, alteration or destruction of any Confidential Information required to be retained for legal or regulatory purposes or stored on back-up tapes or other back-up media or archiving systems made in the ordinary course of business, subject in each case to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein. Each party may only disclose the general nature, but not the specific terms, of this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party; provided, however, either party may provide a copy of this Agreement or otherwise disclose its terms on a confidential basis in connection with any legal or regulatory requirement, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry. For clarity, in the event that use, disclosure or retention of any Confidential Information is required in order for DIALOG to exercise the license granted in Section 2, this Section 10 will not be deemed to prevent such use, disclosure or retention.\n\n  Page 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.3 Required Disclosure. Nothing herein will prevent a receiving party from disclosing all or part of the other's Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to court order, the lawful requirement of a governmental agency or when disclosure is required by operation of law (including disclosures pursuant to applicable securities laws or regulations thereunder); provided, that prior to any such disclosure, the receiving party will use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the disclosing party in writing of such requirement to disclose, and (b) cooperate fully with the disclosing party in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure or obtaining a protective order.   11. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMERS.   11.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties. ENERGOUS and DIALOG hereby each represent and warrant to the other that as of the Effective Date:   (a) it is a duly and validly organized and existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the state or country of its incorporation, as applicable, and that it is legally qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which this Agreement may be performed and the performance of its activities hereunder requires such qualification;   (b)  the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will not result in any breach or violation of any terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents, or any material agreement or instrument to which it is a party, by which it is bound, or to which any of its property is subject;   (c) all requisite corporate action has been taken for the due authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it, and this Agreement constitutes a legally binding obligation, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally; and\n\n  Page 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (d) it is not a party to any litigation relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to affect, its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.   11.2 Product Warranty.   (a)  ENERGOUS warrants that (i) when manufactured in accordance with the Approved Production Specifications, and as implemented in a suitable circuit application in accordance with the Product Specifications, the Products and Product Die will conform to the Product Specifications and will be free from defects that could have been avoided in their design; (ii) the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation and the Deposit Materials do not infringe any third party's Intellectual Property Rights; (iii) it did not misappropriate any third party's trade secrets in the development of the Products, any constituent parts or functionality thereof, the Documentation or the Deposit Materials; and (iv) when delivered (including any software updates if any), no Product will contain any viruses, \"Trojan horses\" or other harmful code. The above warranties are valid for a period of [***] from the date of shipment of any Licensed Product to any customer.   (b) The warranty contained in Section 11.2(a) does not apply to the extent any Product is operated in a manner other than that specified by the Product Specifications, is treated with abuse, negligence or other improper treatment (including, without limitation, use outside the device maximum ratings, package MSL (moisture sensitivity level) guidelines or environmental limits as may be set forth in the Product Specifications), or is defective as a result of any materials or workmanship of the Manufacturing Subcontractors or failure of the Manufacturing Subcontractors to manufacture the Product according to Approved Production Specifications. As such, any warranty claims due to defects in build, materials or workmanship will be directed to the Manufacturing Subcontractors as part of that contract between DIALOG or, if applicable, its Affiliate and such parties.   (c) With the exception of the warranties in Section 11.2(a)(ii) (third party IP infringement) and Section 11.2(a)(iii) (misappropriation of third party trade secrets) related to any Product Die, the warranties in this Section 11.2 do not apply to MCMs or repackaged Product Die developed by or for DIALOG or its Affiliates.   (d) In the event any warranty claim is due to or arises from an Epidemic Defect, ENERGOUS will be responsible for all costs and expenses directly incurred by DIALOG or its Affiliates or their respective customers as a result of reasonable inspection, servicing, repairs, replacements, recall notices, recalls and responses with respect thereto, provided that ENERGOUS' aggregate liability to DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers under this paragraph (d) will not exceed [***] per occurrence of an Epidemic Defect. Each party will immediately notify the other upon becoming aware of the circumstance that could reasonably be construed to be an indication of an Epidemic Defect, and, in any event, will notify the other party immediately upon becoming aware of the existence of an Epidemic Defect. ENERGOUS and DIALOG will expeditiously work together in good faith to determine a technical resolution of the Epidemic Failure. ENERGOUS agrees to make all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly diagnose the Epidemic Failure's root cause, provide DIALOG a report detailing the results of ENERGOUS' investigation and plan an effective workaround and a permanent solution. ENERGOUS will consult with DIALOG on any proposed workarounds and other solutions.   * Confidential Treatment Requested\n\n  Page 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.3  Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. If any of the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials is, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion is likely to become, the subject of an Intellectual Property Rights infringement claim, and as a result DIALOG or any of its Affiliates or their respective customers are enjoined, or in ENERGOUS' or DIALOG's opinion are likely to be enjoined, from using the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, ENERGOUS will use its best efforts to:   (a) procure for DIALOG and its Affiliates and their respective customers the right to continue to use the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable; or, but only in the event that, despite ENERGOUS' best efforts to do so, ENERGOUS is unable to so procure such right,   (b) replace or modify the Products, Product Die, Documentation or Deposit Materials, as applicable, to make them non-infringing, provided that the replaced or modified Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials remain substantially similar in performance to the infringing Products, Product Die, Documentation and Deposit Materials.   If none of the foregoing alternatives is available within a commercially reasonable time period, DIALOG may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect, provided that it will give ENERGOUS prompt prior written notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 11.3 is intended to limit DIALOG's rights to indemnification under Section 12 in connection with any such infringement claim.   11.4  Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11, THE PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCT IP, TOOLING, DOCUMENTATION, DEPOSIT MATERIALS, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND ALL LICENSES, SERVICES AND OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY A PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. EXCEPT FOR THOSE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE.   12. INDEMNIFICATION.   12.1 Indemnification by Energous. Subject to Section 12.2, ENERGOUS agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, in the case of any third party claims, defend DIALOG and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, distributors and customers (collectively, \"DIALOG Indemnitees\") from and against and in respect of any and all alleged or actual demands, claims, actions, causes of action, suits or proceedings, assessments, awarded damages (including punitive damages), liabilities, interest and penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and disbursements in connection therewith) (each, a \"Claim\") to the extent resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any DIALOG Indemnitees by reason of (a) death or bodily injury caused by or resulting from use of the Products, (b) any breach of any representation or warranty made by ENERGOUS hereunder or to any third party in relation to the Products or Product Die, (c) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights in relation to the Products or Product Die, (d) the infringement or misappropriation of any third party Intellectual Property Rights as a result of DIALOG's or its Affiliates' exercise of rights in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Manufacturing Subcontractors' manufacture of the Products on their behalf, provided that the Products are manufactured in strict compliance with the Product Specifications and Approved Production Specifications and only to the extent such Claims arise due to compliance with the Product Specifications and/or the Approved Production Specifications or use of the Tooling provided by ENERGOUS hereunder, (e) the infringement by DIALOG of any third party Marks rights as a result of its authorized use of the ENERGOUS Marks, (f) any failure by ENERGOUS to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (g) ENERGOUS' negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud.\n\n  Page 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.2 Exclusion. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.1, ENERGOUS will not be liable to the extent any Claim results from (a) modification of the Products by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party (including the Manufacturing Subcontractors), or combination of the Products with other products, offered by DIALOG, its Affiliates and/or any third party, (b) acts or omissions of any Manufacturing Subcontractor (except to the extent such Claims are due to the infringement or misappropriation of third party Intellectual Property Rights arising from such Manufacturing Subcontractor's manufacturing of the Products on behalf of DIALOG in strict compliance with the Product Specifications, Approved Production Specifications and Tooling provided by ENERGOUS), (c) failure of any DIALOG Indemnitee to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, or (d) negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud of any DIALOG Indemnitee. For clarification, if any of the foregoing is not the cause, in whole or in part of the Claim, ENERGOUS is not relieved of its obligations under Section 12.1.   12.3 Conditions. DIALOG must notify ENERGOUS within thirty (30) business days after receipt of actual notice of any Claim by a third party for which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, any failure or delay in notice will not relieve ENERGOUS of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that ENERGOUS is actually prejudiced by such failure to notify. ENERGOUS will have control and authority with respect to the defense, litigation, compromise or settlement of such third party Claim (except to the extent that any settlement involves any commitments, responsibilities or obligations on the part of DIALOG, in which case such settlement will require the prior written consent of DIALOG, which consent will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). DIALOG will cooperate and provide assistance and information as may reasonably be required by ENERGOUS (but at ENERGOUS' expense) in connection therewith. DIALOG reserves the right to participate at its own cost in any third party proceedings with counsel of its own choosing. In the event that ENERGOUS does not respond to any third party Claim or does not sufficiently defend such third party Claim, DIALOG, acting reasonably, may step in and take over the defense of such Claim. Costs incurred in the settlement of any Claim, including, but not limited to, reasonable legal expenses, may be off set against future Royalties and Service Fees payable.\n\n  Page 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.4 Insurance. Each party will maintain, during the Term and for three (3) years thereafter, such comprehensive general liability insurance (including without limitation, products liability) as will adequately protect it against its potential liabilities under this Agreement, in amounts customary in the semiconductor industry for similar services and products. Each party will, at the other party's request, provide to the other party a certificate of insurance evidencing the foregoing insurance coverage.   13.
