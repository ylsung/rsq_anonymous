To address this issue, we design a reinforcement learning framework to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) for different tasks, while retaining the original advantages of DenseNet, such as feature reuse, short paths, etc. In this framework, an agent evaluates the importance of each connection between any two block layers, and prunes the redundant connections.

The authors propose a method of detecting suspicious accounts by analyzing their tweets in groups or chunks. They believe that suspicious accounts have a unique pattern in posting tweets, and that reading these tweets in chunks can improve the detection of fake news accounts. The authors test their approach against several baselines and find that it produces superior results. The methodology involves reading the tweets from an account's timeline, sorting them by date, and splitting them into chunks of a certain size. Each chunk is labeled with the label of its corresponding account, and features are extracted from each chunk to feed into a recurrent neural network. The network models the sequential flow of the chunks' tweets and uses an attention layer with dropout to attend over the most important tweets in each chunk. The representation is then fed into a softmax layer to predict the factuality of the accounts. The authors use a dataset of tweets from accounts labeled as propaganda, hoax, and clickbait, and compare their approach to other methods that discard the chronological order of the tweets or read the tweets individually.", "evaluation": "LLM"}

The authors test several semantic and dictionary-based features together with a neural sequential approach, and apply an ablation test to investigate their contribution. The results show that their approach produces superior results at detecting non-factual accounts compared to other approaches that discard the chronological order of the tweets or read the tweets individually. The input representation of a Twitter account is given by a sequence of chunks, where each chunk consists of a sorted sequence of tweets labeled by the label of its corresponding account. Each tweet in the chunk is represented by a vector built by counting the presence of tweet's words in a set of lexical lists. The final representation of the tweet is built by averaging the single word vectors. The features used in the paper include emotion, sentiment, morality, style, and words embeddings. The model used is a recurrent neural model using long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture the previous timesteps (past tweets) and learn the hidden state. The attention layer computes a 'context' vector as the weighted mean of the state sequence. The dataset used is based on two lists annotated in previous works, one for non-factual accounts and one for factual accounts. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines and obtains the highest macro-F1 value of 0.565.", "evaluation": "LLM"}
