Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today.

The storm is expected to turn north into the U.S. on a path similar to 1985's Hurricane Gloria, threatening as much as $13.9 billion in insured losses and possibly forcing the evacuation of parts of New York City.\n\nPreparations are underway in the affected areas, with emergency supplies being stockpiled, road crews on alert to clear fallen trees and other wind-driven debris from highways, and sandbags being placed at Metro stations where water tends to come up over the curbs and flow down escalators. Local officials have issued mandatory evacuation orders for certain areas, and residents have been advised to be prepared for power outages and to monitor local weather forecasts for changing conditions.\n\nThe storm is expected to make landfall on Saturday, and its impact is expected to be felt as far north as New England.

{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "Simultaneous machine translation models start generating a target sequence before they have encoded the source sequence. Recent approaches for this task either apply a fixed policy on a state-of-the art Transformer model, or a learnable monotonic attention on a weaker recurrent neural network-based structure. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, Monotonic Multihead Attention (MMA), which extends the monotonic attention mechanism to multihead attention. We also introduce two novel and interpretable approaches for latency control that are specifically designed for multiple attention heads. We apply MMA to the simultaneous machine translation task and demonstrate better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to MILk, the previous state-of-the-art approach. We analyze how the latency controls affect the attention span and we study the relationship between the speed of a head and the layer it belongs to.

To address this issue, we design a reinforcement learning framework to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) for different tasks, while retaining the original advantages of DenseNet, such as feature reuse, short paths, etc. In this framework, an agent evaluates the importance of each connection between any two block layers, and prunes the redundant connections.
