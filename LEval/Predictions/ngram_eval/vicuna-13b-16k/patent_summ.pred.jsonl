The prior art has shown disadvantages such as the inability to roll logs that include non-sheet-like flammable materials and the need to remove the main shaft each time a log is rolled. The invention described in the patent uses a curvilinearly-shaped body member with a depression or well portion formed in it and a sheet of canvas or similar material positioned over it. A pair of arms extend along the other two opposed sides of the body and are integrally attached together by a handle portion fixedly secured to remote ends of the arms. The arms are of a multi-link construction and are pivotable about the body member along the sides thereof. A roller is fixedly secured between the pair of arms at a position remote from and in substantial parallel alignment with the handle portion. The multi-link construction of the arms permits an effective variation in their respective lengths, so as to facilitate movement of the roller along the body member at variable distances about the pivot points of the arms to the body. Sheets of flammable material may be positioned within the well portion of the body member and then other flammable materials which are not in sheet form, such as leaves, corn fodder, and the like, may be deposited upon the flammable sheets prior to pivoting the arms along the sides of the body member. A pivotal movement of the arms along the sides of the body member results in the roller tending to pull the canvas away from the body member. However, due to the attachment of the canvas to respective ends of the body member, the canvas can only roll along across itself in a manner which results in the sheets of flammable material, along with the other flammable materials positioned thereon, being rolled into a log shape suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like.", "evaluation": "rouge"}
