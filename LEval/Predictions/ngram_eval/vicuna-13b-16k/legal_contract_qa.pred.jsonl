The contract also requires the franchisee to name the franchisor and its affiliates as additional insureds under the insurance policies. This means that the franchisor and its affiliates will be covered under the franchisee's insurance policies in case of any claims or lawsuits arising out of the franchisee's operations.\n\nFurthermore, the contract requires the franchisee to obtain and maintain workers' compensation insurance coverage for its employees. This insurance is required by law in most states and is intended to provide benefits to employees who are injured on the job. The franchisor may also require the franchisee to obtain other types of insurance coverage, such as liability insurance or business interruption insurance, depending on the specific circumstances of the franchise agreement.\n\nOverall, while there is no specific requirement for insurance that must be maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty, the contract does contain provisions that may require insurance coverage.
