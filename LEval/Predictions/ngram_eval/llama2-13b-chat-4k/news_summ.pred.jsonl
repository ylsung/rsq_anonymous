We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel.

The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet.

The court\u2014which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage\u2014will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. \"One person, one vote\": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter\u2014leaving out immigrants and children\u2014Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports. Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10.

The court is currently divided along partisan lines, with five Republican appointees on the right and four Democratic appointees on the left.\n\nThe case involving public sector labor unions, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, could potentially deal a significant blow to organized labor. The case challenges the longstanding practice of requiring public employees to pay union dues as a condition of employment. The plaintiffs argue that this violates their First Amendment rights, while unions argue that it is necessary to ensure \"labor peace\" and prevent freeloading.\n\nThe case on affirmative action, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, is a sequel to a previous case in which the court refused to decide the constitutionality of the university's admissions plan. The plan combines race-neutral and race-conscious tools to achieve diversity. The case has struck many supporters of affirmative action as an ominous sign, as the court has never resolved whether state voting districts should have the same number of people or voters.\n\nThe case on religious exemptions from Obamacare, Zubik v. Burwell, could have significant implications for the future of the Affordable Care Act. The case involves a group of religious-affiliated schools and institutions that are seeking an exemption from the law's contraception coverage requirements. The Obama administration has argued that the exemption would violate the First Amendment, while the religious institutions argue that it would violate their religious beliefs.\n\nFinally, the case of Evenwel v. Abbott could have significant implications for the political balance of power in the United States. The case involves a challenge to the practice of counting all people, including non-citizens and children, in the apportionment of state legislative districts.

To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow\u2014so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist?

Freshmen are more vulnerable to hazing and drinking due to their lack of familiarity with campus life.\n\nThe IFC has taken steps to protect students, including banning alcohol at recruitment events and supporting sanctions against violators. However, some universities have shut down fraternities altogether, and the IFC has threatened to sue schools that violate students' freedom-of-association rights.\n\nFraternity membership has surged in recent years, with 327,260 members in 2011, up from 253,148 in 2005. National fraternities and affiliated foundations generated $185 million in student dues and other revenue in 2010-2011.\n\nOverall, the IFC and fraternities have resisted efforts to delay recruitment and strengthen regulations, prioritizing the \"fraternity experience\" and its benefits for undergraduates. However, the recent death of a Cal Poly freshman highlights the risks of hazing and excessive drinking in fraternity life, and universities must balance the benefits of Greek life with the need to protect students' safety and well-being.", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"query": "Please summarize these news articles.", "gt": "\u2013 Frightened North Carolinians fleeing Irene are jamming highways as the East Coast steels for what could be the biggest hurricane in decades. At least seven states have now declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of flights are being canceled. Gas stations are running out of fuel and ATMs have been emptied of cash as Americans hit the road for a bumper-to-bumper trip out of Irene's angry path. The Category 3 storm is expected to hit the Southeast sometime tomorrow, and hundreds of thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes in three North Carolina counties. Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg says residents in low-lying parts of the city should get out today as the transit system is planned to be shut down tomorrow.", "prompt": "[INST]<<SYS>>\nNow you are given a very long document.

The storm has already begun to affect the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where evacuation orders have been issued. The storm is expected to move north and hit the Washington D.C. area, as well as other states along the East Coast, including Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.\n\nThe storm has the potential to cause significant damage and flooding, with winds of up to 115 mph and a slow movement that will allow it to hover over an area and dump rain and batter it with ferocious winds for an extended period. The storm is expected to turn north into the U.S. on a path similar to 1985's Hurricane Gloria, threatening as much as $13.9 billion in insured losses and possibly forcing the evacuation of parts of New York City.\n\nPreparations are underway in the affected areas, with emergency supplies being stockpiled, road crews on alert to clear fallen trees and other wind-driven debris from highways, and sandbags being placed at Metro stations where water tends to come up over the curbs and flow down escalators. Local officials have issued mandatory evacuation orders for certain areas, and residents have been advised to be prepared for power outages and to monitor local weather forecasts for changing conditions.\n\nThe storm is expected to make landfall on Saturday, and its impact is expected to be felt as far north as New England. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane warning for the North Carolina coast, and a tropical storm warning has been issued for the South Carolina coast. The storm is currently 105 miles east-northeast of Nassau, the Bahamas.", "evaluation": "rouge"}
