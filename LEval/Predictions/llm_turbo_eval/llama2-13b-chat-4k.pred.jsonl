These include (1) considering a measure under the suspension of the rules procedure or by unanimous consent, (2) adopting a special rule that waives the 72-hour requirement, (3) adopting a special rule that waives the one-day requirement for another special rule, and (4) convening a second legislative day on the same calendar day.

Gas stations are running out of fuel and ATMs have been emptied of cash as Americans hit the road for a bumper-to-bumper trip out of Irene's angry path. The Category 3 storm is expected to hit the Southeast sometime tomorrow, and hundreds of thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes in three North Carolina counties. Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today.

The storm is expected to move north and hit the Washington D.C. area, as well as other states along the East Coast, including Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.\n\nThe storm has the potential to cause significant damage and flooding, with winds of up to 115 mph and a slow movement that will allow it to hover over an area and dump rain and batter it with ferocious winds for an extended period. The storm is expected to turn north into the U.S. on a path similar to 1985's Hurricane Gloria, threatening as much as $13.9 billion in insured losses and possibly forcing the evacuation of parts of New York City.\n\nPreparations are underway in the affected areas, with emergency supplies being stockpiled, road crews on alert to clear fallen trees and other wind-driven debris from highways, and sandbags being placed at Metro stations where water tends to come up over the curbs and flow down escalators. Local officials have issued mandatory evacuation orders for certain areas, and residents have been advised to be prepared for power outages and to monitor local weather forecasts for changing conditions.\n\nThe storm is expected to make landfall on Saturday, and its impact is expected to be felt as far north as New England. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane warning for the North Carolina coast, and a tropical storm warning has been issued for the South Carolina coast.

{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "Simultaneous machine translation models start generating a target sequence before they have encoded the source sequence. Recent approaches for this task either apply a fixed policy on a state-of-the art Transformer model, or a learnable monotonic attention on a weaker recurrent neural network-based structure. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, Monotonic Multihead Attention (MMA), which extends the monotonic attention mechanism to multihead attention. We also introduce two novel and interpretable approaches for latency control that are specifically designed for multiple attention heads. We apply MMA to the simultaneous machine translation task and demonstrate better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to MILk, the previous state-of-the-art approach. We analyze how the latency controls affect the attention span and we study the relationship between the speed of a head and the layer it belongs to. Finally, we motivate the introduction of our model by analyzing the effect of the number of decoder layers and heads on quality and latency.", "prompt": "[INST]<<SYS>>\nNow you are given a very long document.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.
