Recent approaches for this task either apply a fixed policy on a state-of-the art Transformer model, or a learnable monotonic attention on a weaker recurrent neural network-based structure. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, Monotonic Multihead Attention (MMA), which extends the monotonic attention mechanism to multihead attention. We also introduce two novel and interpretable approaches for latency control that are specifically designed for multiple attention heads. We apply MMA to the simultaneous machine translation task and demonstrate better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to MILk, the previous state-of-the-art approach. We analyze how the latency controls affect the attention span and we study the relationship between the speed of a head and the layer it belongs to. Finally, we motivate the introduction of our model by analyzing the effect of the number of decoder layers and heads on quality and latency.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.

While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions.

The NCHLT text corpora contains enough data to have 3500 training samples and 600 testing samples of 300+ character sentences per language. Researchers have recently started applying existing algorithms for tasks like neural machine translation in earnest to such South African language datasets. Existing NLP datasets, models, and services are available for South African languages. These include an LID algorithm that uses a character level n-gram language model. Multiple papers have shown that 'shallow' naive Bayes classifiers, SVMs, and similar models work very well for doing LID. The DSL 2017 paper gives an overview of the solutions of all of the teams that competed on the shared task and the winning approach used an SVM with character n-gram, parts of speech tag features, and some other engineered features. The fasttext classifier is perhaps one of the best known efficient 'shallow' text classifiers that have been used for LID. Multiple papers have proposed hierarchical stacked classifiers that would first classify a piece of text by language group and then by exact language. Some work has also been done on classifying surnames between Tshivenda, Xitsonga, and Sepedi. Additionally, data augmentation and adversarial training approaches are potentially very useful to reduce the requirement for data. Researchers have investigated deeper LID models like bidirectional recurrent neural networks or ensembles of recurrent neural networks. The latter is reported to achieve 95.12% in the DSL 2015 shared task", "evaluation": "human"}
