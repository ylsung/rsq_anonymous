Being able to eat breakfast by the pool is seen as a plus.\nThe hotel is clean and well-maintained overall. Rooms may be small but are comfortable and adequately equipped.\nThe location is convenient, though about 2 miles from the main attractions in Key West. Free parking and trolley stops onsite make up for this. \nThe value is considered good for the price, especially compared to hotels closer to downtown.\n\nCons:\nRooms, especially standard rooms, tend to be very small and lack amenities like mini fridges. Suites offer more space.\nNoise from the highway and thin walls between rooms can disturb sleep. The air conditioners also tend to be loud.\nThe location means a taxi or bike/scooter ride is required to get to main attractions. Walking takes about 40 minutes.\nSome complain the hotel overall feels a bit dated and run-down, though clean.\nSo in summary, while the Fairfield Inn has some issues common to budget hotels, the main strengths appear to be the friendly, knowledgeable staff, beautiful pool area, decent value for the price, and clean, comfortable rooms.

To address this issue, we design a reinforcement learning framework to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) for different tasks, while retaining the original advantages of DenseNet, such as feature reuse, short paths, etc. In this framework, an agent evaluates the importance of each connection between any two block layers, and prunes the redundant connections.

{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "Deterministic neural networks (NNs) are increasingly being deployed in safety critical domains, where calibrated, robust and efficient measures of uncertainty are crucial. While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "claude-100k_pred": "We present a novel approach for evidential regression using deep neural networks which simultaneously minimizes prediction error while estimating uncertainties in the network's predictions. Our method places higher-order distributions over model parameters to capture both aleatoric uncertainties from noise in the observations and epistemic uncertainties from lack of data. We achieve this by enforcing evidential priors during training that penalize large amounts of inferred evidence for incorrect predictions. This enables our model to appropriately estimate increasing levels of uncertainty for out-of-distribution datapoints. Our method is validated on benchmark regression tasks and scaled to monocular depth estimation, where it estimates precise uncertainties and identifies adversarial perturbations.",  "evaluation": "human"}

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "claude-100k_pred": "Several methods have been proposed for uncertainty estimation in neural networks [1, 2, 3]. Mixture density networks model aleatoric uncertainty by learning a mixture of Gaussians [1]. Weight uncertainty methods place prior distributions over network weights [2]. However, these methods often underestimate uncertainties on out-of-distribution data [3,4]. Other methods like ensemble-based methods [5,6] and variational dropout [7] provide better uncertainty estimates but require sampling during inference.\nIn contrast, our method uses higher-order evidential distributions [8] to capture uncertainties. We enforce these distributions as priors during training to penalize large amounts of evidence for incorrect predictions. This enables our model to provide well-calibrated uncertainties, outperforming other baselines on benchmark regression tasks. Our method also scales to complex tasks like depth estimation, providing precise uncertainties and robustness to adversarial perturbations.",  "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the confidence of predictions in a regression setting. The approach starts from the standard modelling assuming iid samples from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variances and places evidential priors. This opens the door to online applications with fully integrated uncertainty estimates. \n\nPros:\n1.\tNovel approach to regression (a similar work has been published at NeurIPS last year for classification [3]), but the extension of the work to regression is important.\n2.\tThe experimental results show consistent improvement in performance over a wide base of benchmarks, scales to large vision problems and behaves robustly against adversarial examples.\n3.\tThe presentation of the paper is overall nice, and the Figures are very useful to the general comprehension of the article.\nCons:\n1.\tThe theory of evidence, which is not widely known in the ML community, is not clearly introduced. \nI think that the authors should consider adding a section similar to Section 3 of Sensoy et al. [3] should be considered. Currently, the only step explaining the evidential approach that I found was in section 3.1, in a very small paragraph (between \u201cthe mean of [\u2026] to \\lambda + 2\\alpha.\u201d). I believe that the article would greatly benefit from a more thorough introduction of concepts linked to the theory of evidence.\n2.\tThe authors briefly mention that KL is not well defined between some NIG distributions (p.5) and propose a custom evidence regularizer, but there\u2019s very little insight given on how this connects to/departs from the ELBO approach. \n\nOther comments/questions:\n1.\t(p.1)  I\u2019m not sure to fully understand what\u2019s meant by higher-order/lower-order distributions, could you clarify?\n2.\t(p.3) In section 3.1, the term in the total evidence \\phi_j is not defined.\n3.\t(p.3) Could you comment on the implications of assuming that the estimated distribution can be factorized? \n4.\t(p.4) Could you comment on the difference that there is between NLL_ML and NLL_SOS from a modelling perspective?\n5.\t(p.4) The ELBO loss (6) is unclearly defined, and not connected to the direct context. I would suggest moving this to the section 3.3, where the prior p(\\theta) used in eq. (6) is actually defined.\n\nSpelling & typos:\n-\t(p.4) There are several typos in equation (8), where tau should be replaced with 1/\\sigma^2. \n-\t(p.8) In the last sentence, there is \u201cntwork\u201d instead of network.\n-\t(p.9) There is a typo in the name of J\u00f8sang in the references. \n-\t(p.10) In equation (13), due to the change of variable, there should be a \n-(1/\\tau^2) added;  \n-\t(p.10) In equation (14), the \\exp(-\\lambda*\\pi*(\u2026)) should be replaced with \\exp(-\\lambda*\\tau*(\u2026)). \n\n6: Weak Accept", "claude-100k_pred": "Overall this is an interesting work that seeks to model both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in neural networks for regression tasks. The concept of evidential learning by placing higher-order distributions over the network parameters is a novel approach for estimating uncertainties. The method is evaluated on a range of regression and depth estimation benchmarks, showing competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.\n\nHowever, there are several parts of the method that require clarification:\n\n\u2022 The \"evidential regularizer\" introduced to minimize evidence on errors is not well motivated. The authors argue that using KL divergence to a zero evidence prior is not feasible, but it is not clear why a simple L2 regularization on the evidence hyperparameters would not suffice. More analysis is needed to justify the sharp increase in evidence penalty with error magnitude proposed in this work.\n\n\u2022 More insights could be provided into the assumed conjugate prior distribution choices. Are there advantages to using the Normal Inverse-Gamma distribution over other choices?\n\n\u2022 The impact of hyperparameters associated with the prior distribution, such as \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bb on the uncertainty estimates is not analyzed. It would be useful to study the sensitivity of the method to these parameters.\n\n\u2022 Comparisons with other deep evidential learning techniques such as [8] are missing. The reviewed work focuses primarily on Bayesian approaches.\n\n\u2022 Some examples of how the uncertainty estimates could be used in real world applications would strengthen the practical value of this work.\n\nOverall, this paper proposes an interesting concept for modelling uncertainties in neural networks through evidential learning. With some clarifications on the method and additional analyses, this work could make a useful contribution to the field of uncertainty quantification in deep learning. I recommend the authors consider addressing the raised issues in a revised version of the paper.",  "evaluation": "human"}
