{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "Deterministic neural networks (NNs) are increasingly being deployed in safety critical domains, where calibrated, robust and efficient measures of uncertainty are crucial. While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "claude-100k_pred": "We present a novel approach for evidential regression using deep neural networks which simultaneously minimizes prediction error while estimating uncertainties in the network's predictions. Our method places higher-order distributions over model parameters to capture both aleatoric uncertainties from noise in the observations and epistemic uncertainties from lack of data. We achieve this by enforcing evidential priors during training that penalize large amounts of inferred evidence for incorrect predictions. This enables our model to appropriately estimate increasing levels of uncertainty for out-of-distribution datapoints. Our method is validated on benchmark regression tasks and scaled to monocular depth estimation, where it estimates precise uncertainties and identifies adversarial perturbations.", "evaluation": "human"}

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "claude-100k_pred": "Several methods have been proposed for uncertainty estimation in neural networks [1, 2, 3]. Mixture density networks model aleatoric uncertainty by learning a mixture of Gaussians [1]. Weight uncertainty methods place prior distributions over network weights [2]. However, these methods often underestimate uncertainties on out-of-distribution data [3,4]. Other methods like ensemble-based methods [5,6] and variational dropout [7] provide better uncertainty estimates but require sampling during inference.\nIn contrast, our method uses higher-order evidential distributions [8] to capture uncertainties. We enforce these distributions as priors during training to penalize large amounts of evidence for incorrect predictions. This enables our model to provide well-calibrated uncertainties, outperforming other baselines on benchmark regression tasks. Our method also scales to complex tasks like depth estimation, providing precise uncertainties and robustness to adversarial perturbations.", "evaluation": "human"}

The approach starts from the standard modelling assuming iid samples from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variances and places evidential priors. This opens the door to online applications with fully integrated uncertainty estimates. \n\nPros:\n1.\tNovel approach to regression (a similar work has been published at NeurIPS last year for classification [3]), but the extension of the work to regression is important.\n2.\tThe experimental results show consistent improvement in performance over a wide base of benchmarks, scales to large vision problems and behaves robustly against adversarial examples.\n3.\tThe presentation of the paper is overall nice, and the Figures are very useful to the general comprehension of the article.\nCons:\n1.\tThe theory of evidence, which is not widely known in the ML community, is not clearly introduced. \nI think that the authors should consider adding a section similar to Section 3 of Sensoy et al. [3] should be considered. Currently, the only step explaining the evidential approach that I found was in section 3.1, in a very small paragraph (between \u201cthe mean of [\u2026] to \\lambda + 2\\alpha.\u201d). I believe that the article would greatly benefit from a more thorough introduction of concepts linked to the theory of evidence.\n2.\tThe authors briefly mention that KL is not well defined between some NIG distributions (p.5) and propose a custom evidence regularizer, but there\u2019s very little insight given on how this connects to/departs from the ELBO approach. \n\nOther comments/questions:\n1.\t(p.1)  I\u2019m not sure to fully understand what\u2019s meant by higher-order/lower-order distributions, could you clarify?\n2.\t(p.3) In section 3.1, the term in the total evidence \\phi_j is not defined.\n3.\t(p.3) Could you comment on the implications of assuming that the estimated distribution can be factorized? \n4.\t(p.4) Could you comment on the difference that there is between NLL_ML and NLL_SOS from a modelling perspective?\n5.\t(p.4) The ELBO loss (6) is unclearly defined, and not connected to the direct context.

The concept of evidential learning by placing higher-order distributions over the network parameters is a novel approach for estimating uncertainties. The method is evaluated on a range of regression and depth estimation benchmarks, showing competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.\n\nHowever, there are several parts of the method that require clarification:\n\n\u2022 The \"evidential regularizer\" introduced to minimize evidence on errors is not well motivated. The authors argue that using KL divergence to a zero evidence prior is not feasible, but it is not clear why a simple L2 regularization on the evidence hyperparameters would not suffice. More analysis is needed to justify the sharp increase in evidence penalty with error magnitude proposed in this work.\n\n\u2022 More insights could be provided into the assumed conjugate prior distribution choices. Are there advantages to using the Normal Inverse-Gamma distribution over other choices?\n\n\u2022 The impact of hyperparameters associated with the prior distribution, such as \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bb on the uncertainty estimates is not analyzed. It would be useful to study the sensitivity of the method to these parameters.\n\n\u2022 Comparisons with other deep evidential learning techniques such as [8] are missing. The reviewed work focuses primarily on Bayesian approaches.\n\n\u2022 Some examples of how the uncertainty estimates could be used in real world applications would strengthen the practical value of this work.\n\nOverall, this paper proposes an interesting concept for modelling uncertainties in neural networks through evidential learning. With some clarifications on the method and additional analyses, this work could make a useful contribution to the field of uncertainty quantification in deep learning.

The professor explained that it likely meant the processing improved the signal to noise ratio, not just the absolute signal level. PhD C agreed with this explanation.", "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "Summarize the meeting", "gt": "The meeting began with a discussion on the TORRENT project completion being pushed for two years. Grad F then introduced intermediate categorization, which was his topic for his qualification exams. The team then discussed mean subtraction from SRI. Using it had led to an improvement in Meeting Recorder digits though near mic performance worsened. The professor points to pre-echoes as the culprit. The team continued to study differences between SRI and Aurora. The team thought it would be interesting to do the Aurora tests with the SRI system instead of the HTK. The team was also exploring the Wiener filter and VTS. The professor did not seem too excited about the VTS.", "claude-100k_pred": "The main topics discussed in the meeting were:\n\nPhD E's experiments with mean subtraction and why it made the signal louder\nPhD C's experiments with combining energy-based VAD with MLP-based VAD and potential issues with the approach\nPhD G's work on Wiener filtering and noise compensation techniques\nPhD D's work on applying VTS in the cepstral domain versus the filter bank domain\nThe potential for combining different noise reduction and compensation methods once they have a better understanding of each technique's characteristics\nThe professors and PhD students discussed the experiments, potential issues, and ways to improve the various approaches. They provided feedback and suggestions to help each other refine and improve the noise compensation and other signal processing techniques.", "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "Summarize discussion on what to include in the meeting corpus and how to structure it", "gt": "The discussion centered on the extent to which the recordings should be segmented for the corpus and which recordings should be included in the corpus. The team expressed that it would be helpful to filter out breath and non-verbal sounds. It also expressed that for two person conversations and transcripts that do not follow their general meeting setup, it could create a different directory.", "claude-100k_pred": "There was a discussion about whether to include recordings from a SmartKom experiment in the meeting corpus. The recordings involve people taking part in a travel task scenario with either a computer or a human wizard.\nSome participants argued the recordings should be included since they contain speech data that may be useful for acoustic modeling. Others argued they should not be considered \"meetings\" and should be kept separate.\nThe main debate was around whether to include the recordings in the same directory structure as the meeting corpus or keep them separate. Some favored including them in the same structure but marking them differently to indicate the different interaction type. Others felt they should be kept separate to avoid confusion.\nIn the end, most participants agreed the recordings should be stored separately but could still be included for some experiments at the discretion of individual researchers. The key point was that they did not fit the definition of \"meetings\" that had been described for the meeting corpus.", "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "Summarize discussion on issues with data storage", "gt": "The team felt that the current file system they were using was running out of space, specifically back-up capacity. They needed to figure out a way to back-up the data they were collecting. They decided that the tape system that ICSI has is pretty reliable. But they needed to discuss the matter with the system administrator.", "claude-100k_pred": "There was an extensive discussion about data storage issues due to limited disk space and the backups system becoming saturated.\nParticipants debated using high-density tape drives, burning data to CDs or DVDs periodically, and archiving data to tape while storing it on non-backed up disks.\nUltimately, most participants agreed the best solution was to archive data to tape (which was already in place) while storing it on non-backed up disks. That would avoid burdening the backups system. The data could then be restored from tape as needed.", "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "What did the participants think about what constitutes a meeting?", "gt": "The participants were skeptical that a two person conversation in the hallway constituted a meeting for their purposes. They thought that it would be okay to include this kind of data in their corpus for future researchers, but they should separate it. The Professor has a strong opinion that these interactions were not actually meetings.", "claude-100k_pred": "There were differing views on what constitutes a \"meeting\" for the purpose of including data in the meeting corpus.\nSome participants argued that any interaction involving two or more people conversing should count as a meeting. However, others felt true meetings had a purpose or reason for the interaction and were more naturalistic.\nMost agreed that recordings like the SmartKom experiment were different enough in their purpose and scenario-based nature that they did not fit the definition of \"meetings\" that had been described for the meeting corpus.", "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "What did PhD I think about segmentation?", "gt": "PhD I thought that the team should re-evaluate recognition without cheating on the segmentation. PhD I explained to the team that they had so far been using a simplified version of the scoring and brought up that Thilo wanted to use recognizer alignments to train his speech detector. He was not sure how much hand labeling would be needed to generate data for the detector.", "claude-100k_pred": "PhD I thought re-evaluating speech recognition results using the new automatic segmenter (instead of annotated segments) should be done to check the segmenter's performance.\nPhD I also mentioned that Thilo (another researcher) wanted to use recognizer alignments to train a speech detector, which would reduce the need for manually labeled training data for the speech detector.", "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "What did the Professor think about storing data?", "gt": "The professor expressed that the team should not recycle backed up disk space and explained the rate at which they could acquire disks. He was surprised that burned CD's wear out after a year or two. He thought that putting the data on tape was a good idea.", "claude-100k_pred": "The Professor was generally in favor of storing as much data as possible as long as they had the disk space. He suggested storing the data on non-backed up drives and then archiving it to tape to avoid overloading the ICSI backup system. He and others agreed that using cheap, non-backed up disks and then archiving to tape was a good solution.", "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "What did the participants think about using CD's for backup?", "gt": "PhD I suggested putting the data on a CD-ROM but was informed that the data gets lost in a few years. PhD F expressed that it was generally a bad idea to have a copy on a medium that failed. Professionally pressed discs last longer, but they would be burning them in-house. The idea of re-burning the CD's each year was also not adopted.", "claude-100k_pred": "Most participants were skeptical of using CDs for long-term data backup. Adam pointed out that CDs can fail within a couple of years, either from just sitting on a shelf or from being read and written to. Andreas questioned how CDs could fail from just sitting, and Adam explained that both writable CDs and rewritable CD-RWs do not last long, so they are not good for archiving irreplaceable data. Some participants mentioned that professionally pressed CDs would last longer, for decades, but that overall tape was a more reliable archive medium.", "evaluation": "human"}
{"query": "Summarize the meeting", "gt": "The participants discussed how meetings would be transcribed, what kind of information to include in their corpus as well as how to structure it, issues with storing data, and their model. They were particularly concerned with how IBM could assist with transcribing meetings and how they would manage large amounts of data if they include more information in their corpus, given that they were running low on storage. They decided that they could store the data on tapes for backup, and that they would wait and see how IBM transcribes their meetings. As for the modeling, PhD I reported several results and a few members of the team decided to further discuss progress in a smaller meeting later on.", "claude-100k_pred": "The participants discussed the status of transcribing meeting recordings, both those done by Adam's transcribers and those sent to IBM.\nThey debated what to do with a large amount of digit readings that had been collected but only partially transcribed. Options included automating the process, having IBM transcribe them, or hiring transcribers.\nThere was a discussion about recordings being collected for the SmartKom project and whether to include them in the Meeting Recorder corpus. Some felt they should be included while others thought they were too different from true meetings.\nThe main discussion focused on data storage issues and the saturated ICSI backup system. Participants agreed that using cheap, non-backed up disks and archiving the data to tape once was a good solution to avoid overloading the backups.\nThere were also discussions about SRI recognition experiments and the Absinthe multiprocessor system.\nIn the end, the participants decided to do a \"unison digits\" exercise by all reading digit strings together.", "evaluation": "human"}
