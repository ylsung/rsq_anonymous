The main factor contributing to this result was the capture of a higher percentage of the potential BTC upside and continued production at high run rates, which resulted in lower prompt pricing. The company's gallons sold increased by 15% over last year, but the average selling price was lower due to the compression of spreads between heating oil and feedstocks.

While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.

They assume that the targets, yi, are drawn i.i.d. from a Gaussian distribution with mean and variance parameters \u03b8 = (\u00b5, \u03c32). The likelihood function is given by Li(w) = -log p(yi|\u00b5, \u03c32\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u03b8), where p(yi|\u00b5, \u03c32\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u03b8) is the probability of observing the target yi given the mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c32. By minimizing Li(w), the model is encouraged to learn the average correct answer for a given input, but does not explicitly model any underlying noise or uncertainty in the data when making its estimation.\n\n3. EVIDENTIAL UNCERTAINTY FOR REGRESSION\n\n3.1 PROBLEM SETUP\n\nThe authors consider a regression problem where the observed targets, yi, are drawn i.i.d. from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variance (\u00b5, \u03c32). They assume a conjugate prior distribution on (\u00b5, \u03c32), which is a Gaussian prior on the unknown mean and an Inverse-Gamma prior on the unknown variance. The prior distribution is defined as \u00b5 \u223c N(\u03b3, \u03c32\u03bb\u22121) and \u03c32 \u223c \u0393\u22121(\u03b1, \u03b2). The aim is to estimate a posterior distribution q(\u00b5, \u03c32) = p(\u00b5, \u03c32|y1, . . . , yN ). The authors assume that the estimated distribution can be factorized as q(\u00b5, \u03c32) = q(\u00b5) q(\u03c32).\n\n3.2 LEARNING THE EVIDENTIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe authors describe their approach for learning a model to output the hyperparameters of the evidential distribution. They first maximize the model fit by minimizing the negative log likelihood of the data given the hyperparameters. They then regularize the training by applying a lack of evidence prior, which encourages the model to grow its uncertainty estimates when it makes errors. The loss function", "evaluation": "human"}

The authors propose a method for estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the model's predictions, which are the uncertainties that arise from the data itself and the model's own learning process, respectively.\n\nThe method is based on the idea of using a higher-order prior distribution over the model parameters, which captures both the average correct answer and the uncertainty in the data. This is achieved by placing a conjugate prior distribution on the model parameters, which is a Gaussian distribution with a mean and variance that are themselves modeled as random variables.\n\nThe authors present a step-by-step derivation of the loss function for training a neural network to output the hyperparameters of this higher-order prior distribution, given a set of training examples. The loss function is a combination of two terms: the first term maximizes the model evidence, which is the likelihood of the data given the model parameters, while the second term minimizes the evidence when the prediction is wrong.\n\nThe paper also presents experiments on a benchmark regression task and a high-dimensional task of depth estimation, where the model is trained to output not only the final prediction but also the uncertainty associated with that prediction. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation.\n\n1.
