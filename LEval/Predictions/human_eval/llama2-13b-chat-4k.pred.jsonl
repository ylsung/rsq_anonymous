While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "prompt": "[INST]<<SYS>>\nNow you are given a very long document.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on several benchmark datasets, showing improved performance compared to existing techniques. The approach is also shown to provide a more accurate estimate of uncertainty, especially for predictions far from the training data. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the proposed method and its implementation, as well as an ablation analysis to quantify the added value of the evidential regularizer. The results demonstrate the potential of evidential regression for improving the reliability and robustness of deep learning models in uncertain prediction tasks.", "evaluation": "human"}

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "prompt": "[INST]<<SYS>>\nNow you are given a very long document.

One of the earliest works in this area is the mixture density network (Bishop, 1994), which introduced the concept of probabilistic modeling using mixtures of density functions.\n\nMore recent works have focused on developing methods for uncertainty estimation in deep learning. One popular approach is to use the empirical variance of the network's predictions as a measure of uncertainty (Blundell et al., 2015). However, this method has been shown to underestimate uncertainty, especially in regions far from the training data (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016).\n\nAnother approach is to use Bayesian neural networks (Gelman et al., 2008), which place a prior distribution over the weights of the network. This prior distribution can be used to estimate uncertainty in the network's predictions. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and may not be scalable to large datasets.\n\nRecently, there has been growing interest in using variational inference to approximate the true posterior distribution over the weights of the network (Kingma & Welling, 2014). This approach has been used to develop methods for uncertainty estimation in deep learning, such as the variational dropout method (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016).\n\nAnother line of work has focused on developing methods for evidential reasoning in deep learning. One approach is to use the concept of evidential regression (Jordan, 2009), which places a prior distribution over the parameters of the regression model. This prior distribution can be used to estimate uncertainty in the model's predictions.\n\nFinally, there has been growing interest in developing methods for probabilistic modeling and uncertainty estimation in deep learning.
