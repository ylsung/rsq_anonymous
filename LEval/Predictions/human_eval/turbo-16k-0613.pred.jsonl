While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "prompt": "Now you are given a very long document.

The approach is validated on a benchmark regression task and also applied to the task of depth estimation in computer vision. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms other approaches in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation on various datasets. They also show that the method is robust to adversarial samples and can effectively detect out-of-distribution samples. The proposed framework for evidential representation learning provides a means to achieve precise uncertainty metrics for robust neural network deployment in safety-critical domains.", "evaluation": "human"}

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "prompt": "Now you are given a very long document.

Bishop (1994) introduced mixture density networks, which model the output distribution as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Blundell et al. (2015) proposed weight uncertainty in neural networks, where the weights are treated as random variables and learned using Bayesian inference. Gelman et al.

This opens the door to online applications with fully integrated uncertainty estimates. \n\nPros:\n1.\tNovel approach to regression (a similar work has been published at NeurIPS last year for classification [3]), but the extension of the work to regression is important.\n2.\tThe experimental results show consistent improvement in performance over a wide base of benchmarks, scales to large vision problems and behaves robustly against adversarial examples.\n3.\tThe presentation of the paper is overall nice, and the Figures are very useful to the general comprehension of the article.\nCons:\n1.\tThe theory of evidence, which is not widely known in the ML community, is not clearly introduced. \nI think that the authors should consider adding a section similar to Section 3 of Sensoy et al. [3] should be considered. Currently, the only step explaining the evidential approach that I found was in section 3.1, in a very small paragraph (between \u201cthe mean of [\u2026] to \\lambda + 2\\alpha.\u201d). I believe that the article would greatly benefit from a more thorough introduction of concepts linked to the theory of evidence.\n2.\tThe authors briefly mention that KL is not well defined between some NIG distributions (p.5) and propose a custom evidence regularizer, but there\u2019s very little insight given on how this connects to/departs from the ELBO approach. \n\nOther comments/questions:\n1.\t(p.1)  I\u2019m not sure to fully understand what\u2019s meant by higher-order/lower-order distributions, could you clarify?\n2.\t(p.3) In section 3.1, the term in the total evidence \\phi_j is not defined.\n3.\t(p.3) Could you comment on the implications of assuming that the estimated distribution can be factorized? \n4.\t(p.4) Could you comment on the difference that there is between NLL_ML and NLL_SOS from a modelling perspective?\n5.\t(p.4) The ELBO loss (6) is unclearly defined, and not connected to the direct context. I would suggest moving this to the section 3.3, where the prior p(\\theta) used in eq. (6) is actually defined.\n\nSpelling & typos:\n-\t(p.4) There are several typos in equation (8), where tau should be replaced with 1/\\sigma^2. \n-\t(p.8) In the last sentence, there is \u201cntwork\u201d instead of network.\n-\t(p.9) There is a typo in the name of J\u00f8sang in the references. \n-\t(p.10) In equation (13), due to the change of variable, there should be a \n-(1/\\tau^2) added;  \n-\t(p.10) In equation (14), the \\exp(-\\lambda*\\pi*(\u2026)) should be replaced with \\exp(-\\lambda*\\tau*(\u2026)). \n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "Now you are given a very long document.

Output: ", "turbo-16k-0613_pred": "Review:\n\nThe paper presents a novel approach for estimating uncertainties in neural network predictions. The authors propose a method called evidential regression, which combines maximum likelihood estimation with higher-order prior distributions. The approach is validated on a benchmark regression task and also applied to the task of depth estimation in computer vision.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and the approach is clearly explained. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately estimating uncertainties in neural network predictions. The evidential regression approach outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation on various datasets.\n\nOne suggestion for improvement is to provide more details on the limitations of the proposed method. While the paper mentions that the evidential regression approach is robust to adversarial samples, it would be helpful to discuss any potential limitations or scenarios where the method may not perform well. Additionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison of the computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to other benchmark methods.\n\nAnother suggestion is to provide more insights into the interpretability of the uncertainties estimated by the evidential regression approach. The paper briefly mentions that the aleatoric uncertainty represents statistical or data uncertainty, while the epistemic uncertainty represents model uncertainty. It would be beneficial to provide more examples or visualizations to illustrate how these uncertainties can be interpreted and used in practice.\n\nIn terms of questions, it would be interesting to know if the evidential regression approach can be applied to other types of regression problems beyond the ones presented in the paper. Additionally, it would be helpful to understand how the performance of the method scales with the complexity of the regression task and the size of the dataset.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a novel approach for estimating uncertainties in neural network predictions. The evidential regression method shows promising results in accurately estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The paper is well-written and the experimental results are convincing. However, further investigation into the limitations and interpretability of the method would be valuable.", "evaluation": "human"}
