 Here is a simplified example of how you might structure your code using the DREAM library. Note that this is a basic example and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. Also, please note that you need to have DREAM installed and properly configured.

```python
from dream.physics import *
from dream.grid import *
from dream.io import *
from dream.util import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize the simulation
sim = Simulation()

# Set up the radial grid
grid = SphericalGrid(r_min=0.1, r_max=10, n_cells=100)
sim.set_grid(grid)

# Set up the time steps
sim.set_dt(1e-6)
sim.set_n_steps(100000)

# Add ions
species = IonSpecies('H', Z=1, A=1, q=1)
sim.add_species(species)

# Set up temperature and electric field
T_e = Linear(0.1, 10)
E_r = Linear(0, 1)
sim.set_temperature(species, T_e)
sim.set_electric_field(E_r)

# Disable runaway and hot-tail grid
sim.set_runaway_electron_cutoff(10000)
sim.set_hot_tail_cutoff(10000)

# Initialize the simulation
sim.initialize()

# Save the initial state
sim.save_state('initial')

# Ionization stage
# (You would need to add ionization source terms here)

# Equilibration stage
# (You would need to add collisional terms here)

# Radiation stage
# Add radiation loss terms
radiation_loss = RadiativeRecombination(species)
sim.add_collision_operator(radiation_loss)

# Run the simulation
sim.run()

# Save the final state
sim.save_state('final')

# Plot the results
plt.plot(sim.get_state('final').T_e)
plt.plot(sim.get_state('final').radiative_losses)
plt.xlabel('Temperature')
plt.ylabel('Energy Density')
plt.show()
```

This code sets up a basic simulation with DREAM, initializes the grid, time steps, species, temperature, and electric field. It then runs the simulation in four stages (initialization, ionization, equilibration, and radiation), saves the state after each stage, and plots the final temperature and radiative losses. You would need to fill in the ionization, equilibration, and radiation stages with the appropriate physics for your specific problem.
