This code trains a ResNet18 model on the CLEAR benchmark using the Avalanche library. It defines hyperparameters, creates a learning rate scheduler, and sets up logging to Tensorboard, a text file, and stdout. The main function initializes the model, defines normalization and transformation operations for the training and testing data, and sets up a continual learning strategy using the Naive method from Avalanche. It then runs a training loop, saving the model after each experience and evaluating it on the test stream. Finally, it generates an accuracy matrix and computes the CLEAR metrics, logging these results to a text file.
