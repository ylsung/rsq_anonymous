 Here is a basic example of how you might set up a combined fluid-kinetic simulation using the DREAM library. Please note that this is a simplified version and you may need to adjust it according to your specific needs.

```python
from dream.physics import *
from dream.geometry import Cylindrical
from dream.solvers import NonlinearSolver
from dream.time_steppers import BackwardEuler
from dream.io import HDF5File

# Set simulation parameters
electric_field_strength = 1e5
electron_density = 1e19
temperature = 1e6

# Define momentum grid
momentum_grid = LogGrid(min=1e-3, max=1e3, n_points=100)

# Define initial hot electron Maxwellian
maxwellian = Maxwellian(electron_density, temperature, momentum_grid)

# Define Dreicer and avalanche
dreicer = Dreicer(electric_field_strength, temperature)
avalanche = Avalanche(electron_density, temperature)

# Set up the radial grid
radial_grid = LinearGrid(min=0, max=1, n_points=100)

# Disable runaway grid
runaway_grid = None

# Set Svensson transport coefficients
svensson = Svensson(electron_density, temperature)

# Set up the equation system
equation_system = FluidKinetic(maxwellian, dreicer, avalanche, radial_grid, runaway_grid, svensson)

# Set up the nonlinear solver
solver = NonlinearSolver(equation_system)

# Set up the time stepper
time_stepper = BackwardEuler(solver, 1e-15)

# Set up output file
output_file = HDF5File('simulation.h5', 'w')

# Save settings to output file
output_file.write(time_stepper, 'time_stepper')
output_file.close()
```

This code sets up a simulation with the specified parameters, but it does not run the simulation. You would need to call the `run` method on the `time_stepper` object to actually run the simulation. Also, you may need to import necessary modules and classes, and adjust the code according to the specific structure of your DREAM installation.
