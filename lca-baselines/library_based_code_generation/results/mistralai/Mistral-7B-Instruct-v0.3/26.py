 Here is a basic example of how you might set up an emulation environment using the seedemu library. Please note that this is a simplified version and you may need to adjust it according to your specific needs.

```python
from seedemu import Emulator, Base, Routing, Ebgp, Ibgp, Ospf, WebService, InternetExchange, AutonomousSystem, Host

# Create an emulator
emulator = Emulator()

# Create layers
base_layer = Base(emulator)
routing_layer = Routing(emulator)
ebgp_layer = Ebgp(emulator)
ibgp_layer = Ibgp(emulator)
ospf_layer = Ospf(emulator)
webservice_layer = WebService(emulator)

# Create Internet Exchanges
ie1 = InternetExchange(emulator, display_name='London Internet Exchange')
ie2 = InternetExchange(emulator, display_name='New York Internet Exchange')

# Create Transit Autonomous Systems
as1 = AutonomousSystem(emulator, as_number=64512, name='Transit AS')
as2 = AutonomousSystem(emulator, as_number=64513, name='Transit AS 2')

# Create single-homed stub Autonomous Systems
as3 = AutonomousSystem(emulator, as_number=64514, name='Single-homed AS')
as4 = AutonomousSystem(emulator, as_number=64515, name='Single-homed AS 2')

# Add hosts
host1 = Host(emulator, ip_address='10.0.0.1', autonomous_system=as1)
host2 = Host(emulator, ip_address='192.168.0.1', autonomous_system=as3)

# Create a real-world Autonomous System
real_world_as = AutonomousSystem(emulator, as_number=64516, name='Real World AS')

# Enable remote access
remote_access = emulator.add_remote_access(real_world_as, '123.45.67.89')

# Set up peering via a route server
route_server = InternetExchange(emulator, display_name='Route Server')
peering1 = emulator.add_peering(as1, route_server, peer_type='route_server')
peering2 = emulator.add_peering(as2, route_server, peer_type='route_server')

# Set up private peering with different peer relationships
private_peering1 = emulator.add_private_peering(as3, as4, peer_type='full_mesh')
private_peering2 = emulator.add_private_peering(as1, as2, peer_type='partial')

# Add layers to the emulator
emulator.add_layer(base_layer)
emulator.add_layer(routing_layer)
emulator.add_layer(ebgp_layer)
emulator.add_layer(ibgp_layer)
emulator.add_layer(ospf_layer)
emulator.add_layer(webservice_layer)

# Save the emulator to a component file
emulator.save_component('emulator.xml')

# Render and compile the emulator
emulator.render()
emulator.compile()
```

This code creates an emulation environment with multiple layers, Internet Exchanges, Transit and single-homed stub Autonomous Systems, hosts, a real-world Autonomous System, remote access, peering via a route server, and private peering with different peer relationships. It also saves the emulator to a component file and renders and compiles the emulator.
