 Here is a simplified Python code snippet that uses the expyfun library to set up and run an experiment as per your instructions. Please note that you need to replace `'path_to_sentence1'` and `'path_to_sentence2'` with the actual paths to the sentences on your hard drive. Also, you need to install the expyfun library if you haven't already.

```python
import os
import numpy as np
import soundfile as sf
import expyfun as epf

# Set up experiment parameters
exp_name = 'my_experiment'
sampling_rate = 40000
window_size = 2048
participant = 'participant1'
session = 'session1'
version = 'version1'

# Prepare talkers with different genders
male_talker = epf.Talker(gender='male')
female_talker = epf.Talker(gender='female')

# Load sentences from the hard drive
sentence1 = sf.read(f'path_to_sentence1')[0]
sentence2 = sf.read(f'path_to_sentence2')[0]

# Preload all talkers
male_talker.preload()
female_talker.preload()

# Get a second sentence from memory
second_sentence = female_talker.get_utterance()

# Pad and align sentences at the start
padded_sentence1 = epf.utils.pad_center(sentence1, window_size)
padded_sentence2 = epf.utils.pad_center(second_sentence, window_size)

# Create a new experiment
experiment = epf.Experiment(name=exp_name, sampling_rate=sampling_rate)

# Add talkers to the experiment
experiment.add_talker(male_talker)
experiment.add_talker(female_talker)

# Set up the stimulus
prompt = "Press any key to start the experiment"
experiment.stimulus.text = prompt
experiment.stimulus.duration = 2

# Load the padded sentences into the buffer
experiment.stimulus.buffer = [padded_sentence1, padded_sentence2]

# Set up response menu
response_menu = {'1': 'Option 1', '2': 'Option 2'}
experiment.response.menu = response_menu

# Run the experiment
experiment.run(participant=participant, session=session, version=version)

# Display a prompt based on the response
response = experiment.response.get()
print(f"You selected: {response_menu[response]}")

# Plot a screenshot of the experiment
experiment.plot()
```

This code sets up an experiment with two talkers, loads sentences from the hard drive, pads and aligns the sentences, creates an experiment with the specified parameters, and runs the experiment. It also displays a prompt based on the response and plots a screenshot of the experiment.
