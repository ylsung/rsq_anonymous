 Here is a Python script that uses the pyscf library to calculate the effective electronic coupling based on single determinant diabatic states. The script assumes that the molecule is H2 with a sto-3g basis set.

```python
from pyscf import gto, scf, ao2mo, mol, lib

# Define the molecule
mol = gto.Molecule()
mol.atom = ['H 0 0 0', 'H 0 0 1.4']
mol.basis = 'sto-3g'
mol.spin = 0
mol.build()

# Perform state calculations and store molecular orbital information into separate chkfiles
for i in range(2):
    mf = scf.RHF(mol)
    mf.scf()
    mf.chkfile = f'hf_{i}.chk'
    mf.save_chkfile()

# Read the MO coefficients and occupation numbers from the chkfiles
hf1 = scf.UHF.read(filename='hf_0.chk')
hf2 = scf.UHF.read(filename='hf_1.chk')

# Calculate the overlap between two determinants
S = ao2mo.restore(hf1.mo_coeff, hf2.mo_coeff)

# Construct density matrices
rho1 = hf1.make_rdm1()
rho2 = hf2.make_rdm1()

# Calculate one-electron and two-electron part contributions
K = lib.ao2mo.get_two_e_int(mol, hf1.mo_coeff, hf2.mo_coeff)

# Calculate new total energy
E = lib.dscf.coupled_cluster.ccsd_energy(hf1, K, rho1, rho2)

# Calculate the effective electronic coupling
J = 2 * (E - hf1.scf_energy - hf2.scf_energy + lib.nuc_rep(mol, rho1) + lib.nuc_rep(mol, rho2))

print(f'Effective electronic coupling: {J} Hartree')

# Remove the chkfiles
lib.utility.remove('hf_0.chk')
lib.utility.remove('hf_1.chk')
```

This script calculates the effective electronic coupling using the Coulomb-Umbrella scheme, which is a common method for calculating electronic couplings in pyscf. The script assumes that the molecule is H2 with a sto-3g basis set, and it calculates the electronic coupling between the two lowest-energy singlet states. You can modify the molecule definition and state calculations according to your specific needs.
