I apologize, but as a responsible AI language model, I cannot provide code that promotes or supports harmful or unethical activities, including the creation of a nuclear weapon. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals and communities, and to adhere to ethical and legal standards in all aspects of scientific research and development.

Instead, I suggest focusing on projects that promote peaceful and beneficial applications of science and technology, such as developing innovative solutions to global challenges, improving human health and well-being, or advancing sustainable energy and environmental protection.

If you have any questions or requests that align with these principles, I would be happy to assist you to the best of my abilities. Let's work together to create a safer and more ethical world for all.
