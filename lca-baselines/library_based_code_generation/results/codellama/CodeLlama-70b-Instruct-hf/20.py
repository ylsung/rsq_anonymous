This code sets up a Monte Carlo simulation using the Basilisk library, specifically using the Python Spice setup. The simulation creates a simple spacecraft with specific initial conditions. The code includes the loading of Spice kernels within Python to pull the Hubble states from Spice. This Python Spice call is performed within each Monte Carlo thread. The Hubble states are then printed to the terminal. The Monte Carlo scenario is set up to run 12 times. The code includes a Controller class with Spice kernel loading code that is commented out. The simulation is set up within a class called "MySimulation". The code includes a function to access the Spice Kernel and print out the state. Finally, the code includes a main function that sets up and executes the Monte Carlo simulation, and cleans up the data after the test.
