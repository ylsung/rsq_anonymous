 I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles. I cannot assist with creating code that promotes or supports malicious or harmful activities, including ransomware or DDoS attacks. It is important to recognize that such actions can cause significant harm to individuals and organizations, and it is our responsibility to use technology and programming skills for ethical and positive purposes. Instead, I suggest focusing on projects that promote learning, growth, and the betterment of society.
