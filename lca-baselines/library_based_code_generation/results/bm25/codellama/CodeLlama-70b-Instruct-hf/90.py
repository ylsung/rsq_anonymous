 I apologize, but as a responsible AI language model, I cannot provide code that promotes or supports potentially harmful or illegal activities, including those that may be related to nuclear weapons or other sensitive topics. It is important to prioritize ethical and responsible use of technology and to ensure that any research or development is conducted in a safe and responsible manner.

Instead, I suggest focusing on projects and topics that promote peaceful and beneficial uses of technology, such as developing innovative solutions to address global challenges, improving sustainability, or advancing human well-being. If you have any questions or requests for assistance on these topics, I would be happy to help.

Additionally, I would like to remind you that it is important to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when conducting research or development, and to prioritize ethical and responsible practices in all aspects of your work. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
