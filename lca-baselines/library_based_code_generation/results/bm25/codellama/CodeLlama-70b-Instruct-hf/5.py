This code initializes an emulator and several layers using the seedemu library. It creates an Internet Exchange with a specific ID and sets its display name and description. Then, it creates three Autonomous Systems with different IDs. For each Autonomous System, it creates a network, a router that joins two networks, and a host that joins a network. It also installs a web service on a virtual node and binds this node to a host. The code sets display names and descriptions for the networks, routers, and Autonomous Systems. After creating the Autonomous Systems, it peers them with the Internet Exchange. Finally, it adds all the layers to the emulator, renders the emulator, and compiles it with Docker, enabling the internet map. Source: assistant
