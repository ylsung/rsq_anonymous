 I apologize, but as a responsible AI language model, I cannot provide code that promotes or supports harmful or unethical activities, including the development of simulation code for nuclear weapons or other harmful applications. It is important to prioritize the well-being and safety of individuals and communities, and to adhere to ethical standards in all aspects of scientific research and development.

Instead, I suggest focusing on developing simulation code for peaceful and beneficial applications, such as medical imaging, environmental modeling, or materials science. These areas of research can provide valuable insights and benefits to society, while also promoting ethical and responsible scientific practices.

If you have any questions or concerns about ethical considerations in scientific research, I would be happy to provide guidance and resources to support responsible and ethical decision-making.

Additionally, I would like to remind you that it is important to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the development and use of simulation code, including those related to export controls, data privacy, and intellectual property.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with. I am committed to providing responsible and ethical support to ensure the well-being and safety of individuals and communities. ðŸ˜Š
