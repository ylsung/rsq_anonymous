This code sets up a secure data sharing policy using the nucypher library. It performs the following tasks:

1. Sets up logging and environment variables for the Ethereum RPC endpoint, wallet filepath, and Alice's Ethereum address.
2. Connects to the Ethereum provider and layer 2 provider.
3. Unlocks Alice's Ethereum wallet using a password.
4. Sets up Alice's payment method using the SubscriptionManagerPayment class.
5. Creates an instance of Alice with her Ethereum address, signer, domain, Ethereum provider URI, and payment method.
6. Starts Alice's learning loop.
7. Creates a policy label and gets the policy public key associated with the label.
8. Generates heart rate samples using a heart monitor and saves them as a file.
9. Gets the public keys of the recipient (Doctor) and creates an instance of Bob with these keys.
10. Sets up policy details such as the policy expiration date and m-out-of-n shares.
11. Grants access to Bob by creating a policy and sending it to the NuCypher network.
12. Stores additional information about the policy in a JSON file.

This code is designed to be secure and reliable, ensuring that the data sharing policy is set up correctly and that the necessary information is stored for future reference.

Please note that this code is provided as a sample and may require modification to fit your specific use case. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and reviewed before using it in a production environment.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
