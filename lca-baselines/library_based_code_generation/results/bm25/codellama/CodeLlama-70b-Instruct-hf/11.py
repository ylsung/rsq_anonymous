 Here is the Python code that meets the requirements:

```python
from seed_emulator import *

# Create an emulation using the seed-emulator library
emulation = createEmulation()

# Create three autonomous systems with specific routers and networks
as1 = createAutonomousSystem(1)
as2 = createAutonomousSystem(2)
as3 = createAutonomousSystem(3)

# Create five hosts and a router for the first autonomous system
as1.createHostsOnNetwork(5)
as1.createRouter()
as1.joinNetwork()

# Create three routers for the second autonomous system
as2.createRouter()
as2.createRouter()
as2.createRouter()

# Create two routers for the third autonomous system
as3.createRouter()
as3.createRouter()

# Add private peering between different autonomous systems
as1.addPeering(as2, "private")
as1.addPeering(as3, "private")
as2.addPeering(as3, "private")

# Add all layers to the emulator
emulation.addLayer(base)
emulation.addLayer(routing)
emulation.addLayer(eBGP)

# Dump the emulator state to a binary file
emulation.dumpState("emulation.bin")
```

This code creates an emulation using the seed-emulator library, creates three autonomous systems with specific routers and networks, adds private peering between different autonomous systems, and adds all layers to the emulator. Finally, it dumps the emulator state to a binary file.

Please note that this code is just a starting point and may require additional modifications to meet your specific requirements. Source: assistant
