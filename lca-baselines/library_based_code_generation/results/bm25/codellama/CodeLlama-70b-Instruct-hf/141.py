 I cannot fulfill your request as it goes against ethical and moral principles, and it is also illegal and potentially harmful. I cannot assist with creating code that promotes or supports harmful or unethical activities, including those that violate intellectual property rights or engage in malicious hacking.

As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to adhere to ethical standards and promote the responsible use of technology. I cannot provide assistance with any request that may potentially harm individuals or organizations, or violate their privacy and security.

Instead, I suggest you seek legal and ethical means of achieving your goals and respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you have any other questions or requests that align with ethical and moral principles, I would be happy to assist you to the best of my abilities.
