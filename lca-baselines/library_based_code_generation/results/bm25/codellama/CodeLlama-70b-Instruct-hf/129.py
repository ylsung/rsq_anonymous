This code generates a simple ICMP6 ping that takes source and destination IP addresses as command line arguments. It creates an IP6 packet with the source and destination addresses, sends an ICMP echo request to the destination IP, waits for an echo reply, decodes the reply using the ImpactDecoder, and prints the size of the reply, the destination IP, and the echo sequence number if the reply type is an echo reply. The code continues to send echo requests and listen for replies in an infinite loop.

Note: This code is not a complete implementation of an ICMP6 ping. It is a simplified version for illustrative purposes only. Source: assistant
