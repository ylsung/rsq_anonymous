This code creates a PyQtGraph application with a main window that displays three plots. The first plot is non-interactive and displays an image with an integrated vertical color bar. The second plot is interactive and displays a noisy image with an integrated horizontal color bar. The third and fourth plots display noisy images and share a separate color bar. The color bars are created using the ColorBarItem class from the PyQtGraph library. The images are created using the ImageItem class from the PyQtGraph library. The plots are created using the addPlot method of a GraphicsLayoutWidget instance. The application starts the Qt event loop if it is the main module.

This code is based on the PyQtGraph library and uses the ColorBarItem and ImageItem classes to create color bars and images. It also uses the GraphicsLayoutWidget class to create a main window with three plots. The plots are interactive and display noisy images with integrated color bars. The code starts the Qt event loop if it is the main module.

This code is a good starting point for creating a PyQtGraph application with a main window that displays three plots. It can be modified to fit specific requirements and to display different types of images and color bars.

Please note that this code is provided as a starting point and may require additional modifications to fit specific requirements. It is not a complete solution and should not be used in production without proper testing and modification.
