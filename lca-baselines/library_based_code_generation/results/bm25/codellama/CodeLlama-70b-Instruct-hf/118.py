This code imports necessary transformations and constants from the 'psyclone' library. It defines several boolean variables to control the application of different transformations. Then, it defines a function that applies a series of transformations to a given 'psy' object. The transformations include redundant computation, asynchronous halo exchanges, OpenMP colouring, and intrinsic inlining. The function iterates over all invokes in the 'psy' object and applies the transformations according to the defined boolean variables. The function also handles TransformationErrors. Finally, the function returns the transformed 'psy' object.

Note: This code is just a sample and may not work as-is. You may need to modify it according to your specific requirements.
