4.  Loops over components of the mesh, creating stiffness and element object for each.
5.  Creates a TACS assembler object from the mesh loader.
6.  Creates a KS function and gets the design variable values.
7.  Gets the node locations and creates the forces.
8.  Sets up and solves the analysis problem by creating vectors, assembling the Jacobian, factoring, and solving the linear system.
9.  Evaluates the function and solves for the adjoint variables.
10. Computes the total derivative with respect to material design variables and nodal locations.
11. Creates a random direction along which to perturb the nodes and computes the total derivative with respect to nodal locations.
