  Here is the code to create an emulation using the seedemu library:
```
from seedemu import Emulator, AutonomousSystem, Host, InternetExchange, DomainNameCachingService, eBGP

# Create the emulator
emulator = Emulator()

# Create the base layer
base_layer = emulator.makeEmulatorBaseWith10StubASAndHosts()

# Create the routing layer
routing_layer = emulator.makeEmulatorBaseWith5StubASAndHosts()

# Create the eBGP layer
ebgp_layer = eBGP()

# Create the domain name caching service
dns_service = DomainNameCachingService()

# Add the domain name caching service to the emulator
emulator.addService(dns_service)

# Add the base, routing, and eBGP layers to the emulator
emulator.addLayer(base_layer)
emulator.addLayer(routing_layer)
emulator.addLayer(ebgp_layer)

# Configure the autonomous systems
for as in base_layer.autonomous_systems:
    as.setAutonomousSystem(as.asn)
    as.setAutonomousSystem(as.name)

# Configure the hosts
for host in base_layer.hosts:
    host.setHost(host.name)
    host.setHost(host.ip)

# Configure the internet exchanges
for ie in base_layer.internet_exchanges:
    ie.setInternetExchange(ie.name)
    ie.setInternetExchange(ie.ip)

# Add private peerings between autonomous systems
for as1 in base_layer.autonomous_systems:
    for as2 in base_layer.autonomous_systems:
        if as1.asn != as2.asn:
            ebgp_layer.addPrivatePeering(as1, as2)

# Dump the state of the emulator to a binary file
emulator.dumpState("emulator_state.bin")
```
This code creates an emulation with three layers: base, routing, and eBGP. It also includes a domain name caching service. The base layer creates multiple autonomous systems and internet exchanges, and the domain name caching service is installed on specific hosts within the autonomous systems. The eBGP layer adds private peerings between different autonomous systems. Finally, the state of the emulator is dumped to a binary file.
