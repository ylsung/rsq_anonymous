  Here is an example of Python code that simulates fireworks using the vispy library:
```
import vispy
from vispy import app
from vispy.gloo import VertexBufferObject
from vispy.gloo import FragmentShader
from vispy.gloo import VertexShader

class Canvas(app.Canvas):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        super().__init__(width, height)
        self.simulation = None
        self.explosions = []
        self.vertex_buffer = VertexBufferObject()
        self.fragment_shader = FragmentShader()
        self.vertex_shader = VertexShader()

    def initialize(self):
        self.simulation = vispy.Simulation(self.width, self.height)
        self.explosions = []
        self.vertex_buffer = VertexBufferObject()
        self.fragment_shader = FragmentShader()
        self.vertex_shader = VertexShader()

    def draw(self):
        self.simulation.draw(self.vertex_buffer, self.fragment_shader, self.vertex_shader)

    def resize(self, width, height):
        self.simulation.resize(width, height)
        self.vertex_buffer.resize(width, height)
        self.fragment_shader.resize(width, height)
        self.vertex_shader.resize(width, height)

    def time(self):
        self.simulation.time()

    def create_explosion(self):
        self.explosions.append(vispy.Explosion(self.width, self.height))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    canvas = Canvas(800, 600)
    canvas.initialize()
    canvas.show()
    app.run()
```
This code creates a `Canvas` class that inherits from `app.Canvas`. The `initialize` method initializes the simulation, the `draw` method draws the simulation, the `resize` method resizes the simulation, the `time` method times the simulation, and the `create_explosion` method creates a new explosion. The `main` method creates an instance of the `Canvas` class and runs the simulation.

The `vispy` library provides the `Simulation`, `Explosion`, and `VertexBufferObject` classes that are used in the code. The `Simulation` class simulates the fireworks, the `Explosion` class represents an explosion, and the `VertexBufferObject` class is used to store the vertex data for the simulation.

The `FragmentShader` and `VertexShader` classes are used to define the vertex and fragment shaders that are used to render the simulation. The `FragmentShader` class defines the fragment shader, and the `VertexShader` class defines the vertex shader.

The code uses the `vispy.gloo` module to create the vertex and fragment shaders, and the `vispy.gloo.VertexBufferObject` class to store the vertex data for the simulation. The `vispy.gloo.FragmentShader` and `vispy.gloo.VertexShader` classes are used to define the vertex and fragment shaders that are used to render the simulation.
