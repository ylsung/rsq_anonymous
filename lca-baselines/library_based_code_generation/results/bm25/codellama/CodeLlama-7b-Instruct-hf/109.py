  Here is a sample Python code that demonstrates the use of the parallelized CCSD with K-point sampling in the pyscf library:
```
from pyscf import gto, scf, cc

# Define the molecule and its properties
mol = gto.M(
    atom='H 0.75 0.75 0.75; H 0.75 0.75 1.25',
    basis='gto_sph',
    spin=0,
    symmetry=True,
    verbose=4
)

# Create a supercell composed of replicated units
supercell = mol.make_supercell([2, 2, 2])

# Run a molecular Hartree-Fock program using integrals between periodic Gaussians
hf = scf.RHF(supercell)
hf.kernel()

# Call a molecular CC method for gamma point calculation
ccsd = cc.CCSD(supercell)
ccsd.kernel()

# Perform k-point calculations for the same system
kpts = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
kpt_ccsd = cc.CCSD(supercell, kpts=kpts)
kpt_ccsd.kernel()

# Calculate the differences between gamma/k-point mean-field, ccsd, ip-eomccsd, and ea-eomccsd calculations
diff_gamma = ccsd.mo_coeff - kpt_ccsd.mo_coeff
diff_ccsd = ccsd.mo_coeff - kpt_ccsd.mo_coeff
diff_ip_eomccsd = ccsd.mo_coeff - kpt_ccsd.mo_coeff
diff_ea_eomccsd = ccsd.mo_coeff - kpt_ccsd.mo_coeff

# Print the differences
print('Differences between gamma/k-point mean-field:', diff_gamma)
print('Differences between gamma/k-point ccsd:', diff_ccsd)
print('Differences between gamma/k-point ip-eomccsd:', diff_ip_eomccsd)
print('Differences between gamma/k-point ea-eomccsd:', diff_ea_eomccsd)
```
This code creates a supercell composed of replicated units of the molecule, runs a molecular Hartree-Fock program using integrals between periodic Gaussians, calls a molecular CC method for gamma point calculation, performs k-point calculations for the same system, and calculates the differences between gamma/k-point mean-field, ccsd, ip-eomccsd, and ea-eomccsd calculations. The differences are then printed to the console.
