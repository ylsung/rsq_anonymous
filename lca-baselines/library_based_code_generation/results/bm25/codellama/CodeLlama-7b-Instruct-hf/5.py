  Here is the Python code based on the instruction:
```
from seedemu import *

# Initialize the emulator
emulator = makeEmulatorBaseWith10StubASAndHosts()

# Create an Internet Exchange with ID 1 and set its display name and description
ie = createInternetExchange(1, "Internet Exchange", "This is an Internet Exchange")

# Create three Autonomous Systems with different IDs
as1 = createAutonomousSystem(1, "Autonomous System 1", "This is Autonomous System 1")
as2 = createAutonomousSystem(2, "Autonomous System 2", "This is Autonomous System 2")
as3 = createAutonomousSystem(3, "Autonomous System 3", "This is Autonomous System 3")

# Create a network for each Autonomous System
network1 = createNetwork(as1, "Network 1", "This is Network 1")
network2 = createNetwork(as2, "Network 2", "This is Network 2")
network3 = createNetwork(as3, "Network 3", "This is Network 3")

# Create a router that joins two networks
router = createRouter(network1, network2, "Router 1", "This is Router 1")

# Create a host that joins a network
host1 = createHost(network1, "Host 1", "This is Host 1")
host2 = createHost(network2, "Host 2", "This is Host 2")
host3 = createHost(network3, "Host 3", "This is Host 3")

# Install a web service on a virtual node and bind this node to a host
virtual_node = createVirtualNode(host1, "Virtual Node 1", "This is Virtual Node 1")
virtual_node.install_web_service("http://example.com")

# Set display names and descriptions for the networks, routers, and Autonomous Systems
setNetworkDisplayName(network1, "Network 1")
setNetworkDisplayName(network2, "Network 2")
setNetworkDisplayName(network3, "Network 3")
setRouterDisplayName(router, "Router 1")
setAutonomousSystemDisplayName(as1, "Autonomous System 1")
setAutonomousSystemDisplayName(as2, "Autonomous System 2")
setAutonomousSystemDisplayName(as3, "Autonomous System 3")

# Peer the Autonomous Systems with the Internet Exchange
peerAutonomousSystems(as1, ie)
peerAutonomousSystems(as2, ie)
peerAutonomousSystems(as3, ie)

# Add all the layers to the emulator
addLayer(emulator, network1)
addLayer(emulator, network2)
addLayer(emulator, network3)
addLayer(emulator, router)
addLayer(emulator, as1)
addLayer(emulator, as2)
addLayer(emulator, as3)
addLayer(emulator, ie)

# Render the emulator and compile it with Docker
renderEmulator(emulator)
compileEmulatorWithDocker(emulator)

# Enable the internet map
