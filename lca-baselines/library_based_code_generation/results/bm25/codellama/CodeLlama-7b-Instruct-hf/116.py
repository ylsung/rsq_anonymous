This code defines a set of hyperparameters, creates a learning rate scheduler, and defines a main function that initializes a ResNet18 model, defines normalization and transformation operations for the training and testing data, and sets up logging to Tensorboard, a text file, and stdout. It also defines an evaluation plugin with various metrics and a continual learning strategy using the Naive method from Avalanche. The code then runs a training loop, saving the model after each experience and evaluating it on the test stream. Finally, it generates an accuracy matrix and computes the CLEAR metrics, logging these results to a text file.
