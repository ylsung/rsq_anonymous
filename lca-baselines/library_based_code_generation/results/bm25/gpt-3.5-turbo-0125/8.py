# Parse command line arguments for paths to scene, texture, material files, and output directory

# Load scene and label objects based on mapping from CSV file

# Load materials and randomly assign them to 40% of objects

# Load textures for materials assigned to at least one object

# Extract floors and ceilings from wall objects and assign appropriate category IDs

# Make all lamp objects emit light and make all ceiling objects emit a bit of light

# Create BVH tree containing all mesh objects and sample camera locations above the floor

# Ensure no obstacles in front of camera and scene coverage score is not too low

# Enable normal, depth, and segmentation rendering

# Render scene and write data to .hdf5 file in specified output directory

# Use provided library APIs as needed

# Example code structure, not complete implementation
