 Here is the Python code using the pyaedt library to create a flex cable CPWG (coplanar waveguide with ground) in HFSS:

```python
from pyaedt import *

# Set non-graphical mode
Aedt.set_option('non_graphical', True)

# Launch AEDT in specified version and solution type
Aedt.launch(version='2021.1', solution='HFSS')

# Set properties
Aedt.hfss3dl_a(material_override='Cu', causal_materials=True, open_region=True, model_units='mm', initial_mesh='auto')

# Define variables
total_length = 100 # mm
theta = 45 # degrees
radius = 5 # mm
width = 0.5 # mm
height = 0.1 # mm
spacing = 0.5 # mm
ground_width = 5 # mm
ground_thickness = 0.1 # mm

# Function to create a bending based on the curvature radius and extension
def create_bending(radius, extension):
    point1 = point_a(x=0, y=0, z=0)
    point2 = point_a(x=extension, y=0, z=0)
    arc_center = point_a(x=(point1.x + point2.x) / 2, y=(point1.y + point2.y) / 2, z=0)
    arc = test_54b_open_and_load_a_polyline(arc_center, radius, 0, 180, 360)
    return arc

# Create signal line and ground lines
signal_line = test_54b_open_and_load_a_polyline(point_a(x=0, y=0, z=0), point_a(x=total_length, y=0, z=0), width, height, spacing)
ground_line1 = test_54b_open_and_load_a_polyline(point_a(x=0, y=0, z=0), point_a(x=total_length, y=0, z=0), ground_width, 0, 0)
ground_line2 = duplicate_and_mirror(ground_line1, z=-height)

# Create dielectric cable
dielectric = icepak_a(point_a(x=0, y=0, z=0), point_a(x=total_length, y=0, z=0), radius, height, width, 'SiO2', 3.48)

# Create bottom metals
bottom_metal = create_sheet_to_ground(point_a(x=0, y=0, z=-height), point_a(x=total_length, y=0, z=-height), ground_thickness)

# Create port interfaces (PEC enclosures)
port_enclosure = create_sheet_to_ground(point_a(x=0, y=0, z=0), point_a(x=total_length, y=0, z=0), 0)

# Create Perfect E boundary condition
perfect_e_boundary = create_port_between_pin_and_layer(point_a(x=0, y=0, z=0), point_a(x=total_length, y=0, z=0), 'PEC')

# Create ports and setup and sweep
ports = [create_port_between_pin_and_layer(point_a(x=0, y=0, z=0), point_a(x=total_length, y=0, z=0), 'Port1')]
setup = Setup()
sweep = Sweep('Frequency', '10GHz', '60GHz', '1GHz')

# Bend the signal line and ground lines
bent_signal_line = move_and_connect_to(signal_line, create_bending(radius, total_length * math.tan(math.radians(theta))))
bent_ground_line1 = move_and_connect_to(ground_line1, create_bending(radius, total_length * math.tan(math.radians(theta))))
bent_ground_line2 = move_and_connect_to(ground_line2, create_bending(radius, total_length * math.tan(math.radians(theta))))

# Plot the model
Aedt.test_09b_export_report_A('FlexCableCPWG')

# Release AEDT
Aedt.clean_cache_and_files()
```

This code creates a bent flex cable CPWG with a coplanar waveguide and ground in HFSS using the pyaedt library. The code sets the necessary properties, defines variables for the flex cable, creates the signal line, ground lines, dielectric cable, bottom metals, port interfaces, and Perfect E boundary condition. It also creates ports, a setup, and a sweep. The signal line and ground lines are bent using the `create_bending` function. The model is then plotted and AEDT is released.
