 Here is a simplified Python code that follows your instructions, using the simsopt library and scipy.optimize. Please note that this is a basic example and might need adjustments to fit your specific needs.

```python
from simsopt import *
from simsopt.utilities import *
from simsopt.utilities.magnetic_field import _A_impl, B_and_dB_vjp, A_vjp, A_and_dA_vjp
from scipy.optimize import minimize
import numpy as np
from simsopt.utilities.multifilament import create_multifilament_grid

# Define the objective function
def obj_func(x):
    A, dA_dx = A_and_dA_vjp(x)
    flux = np.sum(np.square(A[:, 0, 0]))
    curve_length = np.sum(np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(A[:, 1:, 0] - A[:, :-1, 0]), axis=1)))
    distance = np.sum(np.square(np.linalg.norm(A[:, 1:, 0] - A[:, :-1, 0], axis=2)))
    return flux + 10 * curve_length + 10 * distance

# Define the constraints
def constraints(x):
    A, dA_dx = A_and_dA_vjp(x)
    return np.max(A) - 1, 1 - np.min(A)

# Initialize the boundary magnetic surface
boundary_surface = test_curves_and_surface(10, 10, 10, 1, 1, 1)

# Create equally spaced curves and multifilament grid
n_filaments = 100
n_segments = 10
curves = create_multifilament_grid(boundary_surface, n_filaments, n_segments)

# Apply stellarator and rotation symmetries
curves = relax_and_split(curves, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)

# Define the Biot-Savart law
def biot_savart(x):
    A, dA_dx = A_and_dA_vjp(x)
    B = B_and_dB_vjp(A)
    return B

# Perform Taylor test
taylor_test(biot_savart, 1e-6)

# Define the optimization problem
problem = Problem(obj_func, constraints, biot_savart)

# Run the optimization using the L-BFGS-B method
result = minimize(problem.objective, problem.initial_guess, method='L-BFGS-B', bounds=problem.bounds)

# Save the result in VTK format
test_get_and_write_nml(result.x, 'result.nml')
```

This code initializes a coil optimization problem, defines the objective function, and applies the L-BFGS-B method from scipy.optimize to find the optimal coil configuration. The coil is approximated using a multifilament approach, and the objective function includes terms for the squared flux, curve length penalty, and coil-to-coil distance penalty. The result is saved in VTK format.
