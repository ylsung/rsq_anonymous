 Here is a basic example of how you might set up a radial transport simulation using the DREAM library in Python. Please note that this is a simplified example and you may need to adjust it according to your specific needs.

```python
from dream.api import __and__, loadCODE, formatTimeAndUnit, getTimeAndUnit, ColdElectronTemperature, RadialGrid, construct_A, TransportSettings, setGrid, changeRadialGrid, runSimulation, setHot, TransportCoefficientReader, setTemperature, HotElectronDistribution, setBiuniformGrid, setCustomGrid, TransportException, Grid, TimeStepper

# Load the DREAM code
code = loadCODE('your_code_file.f90')

# Set up simulation parameters
n_re = 1.0e13  # initial n_re
T_initial = 1.0e6  # initial temperature in K
T_final = 2.0e6  # final temperature in K
n_steps = 1000  # number of time steps
ion_species = 'D'  # ion species
E_field = 1.0e3  # electric field in V/m
T_cold_e = 1.0e4  # cold electron temperature in K

# Set up radial grid
grid = RadialGrid(r_min=0.1, r_max=10.0, n_points=100)
setGrid(grid)

# Set up time stepper
time_stepper = TimeStepper(dt=1.0e-9)

# Set up ions
ions = __and__(HotElectronDistribution, setTemperature(T_cold_e))
ions = __and__(ions, setBiuniformGrid(grid))

# Set up transport settings
transport_settings = TransportSettings()
transport_settings = __and__(transport_settings, TransportCoefficientReader('your_transport_coefficient_file.dat'))
transport_settings = __and__(transport_settings, setRadialDiffusion(1.0e5))  # constant scalar diffusion coefficient

# Enable hot tail grid
setHot(True)

# Set E_field and T_cold_e
setE_field(E_field)
setColdElectronTemperature(T_cold_e)

# Set up transport modes and conditions
# ... (You would need to add your specific conditions here)

# Run the simulation
runSimulation(n_steps, n_re, T_initial, T_final, ion_species, time_stepper, transport_settings)
```

This code sets up a radial transport simulation with a constant scalar diffusion coefficient, using the DREAM library. It initializes the simulation with specific parameters such as initial and final temperatures, time steps, ion species, electric field, and cold electron temperature. It also sets up a radial grid, time stepper, and ions. The E_field and cold electron temperature are set, and the hot tail grid is enabled. The transport settings are also set up, and finally, the simulation is run. The transport modes and conditions are left blank for you to fill in according to your specific needs.
