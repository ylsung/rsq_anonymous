 Here is a simplified example of how you might structure your code using pySCF. Note that this is a basic example and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs.

```python
from pyscf import gto, scf, cc, df, kpoint, symm, ao2mo, mcscf
import numpy as np

# Define the supercell
cell = gto.Mole()
cell.atom = [('H', [0, 0, 0]), ('H', [0, 0, a])]  # a is the supercell lattice constant
cell.basis = '6-31g'
cell.spin = 1  # spin-unrestricted
cell.verbose = 5
cell.build()

# Define the k-point sampling
kpts = kpoint.MonkhorstPack(3, 3, 3)

# Define the molecular Hartree-Fock program
mf = scf.RHF(cell)
mf.kernel()

# Define the molecular CC method
ccsd = cc.CCSD(mf)

# Define the integral-direct method for periodic gaussians
integrals = ao2mo.Integral(cell, kpts=kpts, verbose=5)
integrals.generate()

# Set up the CCSD method with the integral-direct method
ccsd.set_integrals(integrals)

# Perform gamma point calculation
ccsd_gamma = ccsd.kernel(0, 0)

# Perform k-point calculations for the same system
kpts_ccsd = []
for k in kpts:
    ccsd.set_kpts(k)
    kpts_ccsd.append(ccsd.kernel(0, 0))

# Calculate the differences between gamma/k-point mean-field, ccsd, ip-eomccsd, and ea-eomccsd calculations
diffs = np.zeros((len(kpts_ccsd), 4))
for i, k in enumerate(kpts):
    mf_k = scf.RHF(cell, kpts=k)
    mf_k.kernel()
    diffs[i, 0] = np.abs(mf_k.energy - mf.energy)
    diffs[i, 1] = np.abs(kpts_ccsd[i].energy - ccsd_gamma.energy)
    ip_eom_ccsd = cc.IPeomCCSD(ccsd)
    ip_eom_ccsd.set_integrals(integrals)
    ip_eom_ccsd.kernel(0, 0)
    diffs[i, 2] = np.abs(ip_eom_ccsd.energy - kpts_ccsd[i].energy)
    ea_eom_ccsd = cc.EAeomCCSD(ccsd)
    ea_eom_ccsd.set_integrals(integrals)
    ea_eom_ccsd.kernel(0, 0)
    diffs[i, 3] = np.abs(ea_eom_ccsd.energy - kpts_ccsd[i].energy)

# Print the differences
print(diffs)
```

This code creates a supercell, defines k-point sampling, performs a Hartree-Fock calculation, sets up a CCSD method with integral-direct method for periodic gaussians, performs a gamma point calculation, performs k-point calculations for the same system, and calculates and prints the differences between gamma/k-point mean-field, ccsd, ip-eomccsd, and ea-eomccsd calculations.
